(Replies should go to the e-mail address given in his message.)  Having bought an iBook just after Christmas due to the fantastic UNIXness of MacOS X, I've noticed that there are a lot of people in the UNIX admin world who seem to have been sprouting Macs over the last year or so since OS X became, uh, usable, and in particular a lot of people on sage-members are mentioning OS X these days.  I thought I might do a little survey to see how prevalent this actually is, so if you're one of those UNIX people who's started using a Mac since the OS X fuss started, it'd be interesting if you could drop me some mail at mpk@uffish.net with some or all of the following information:  1) What machine you bought 2) When you bought it 3) Why you bought it (i.e. 'It runs UNIX and it's cool!') 4) What platform you would have previously used for the application you now    use a Mac for (i.e. 'Linux on a Toshiba laptop') 5) Whether you plan on buying any more Macs - or do you just have the one    machine for the curiosity value?  For instance, in my case:  1) iBook 800MHz 2) December 2002 3) It runs UNIX and it's cool! 4) Windows or FreeBSD 5) A G4 PowerMac, sometime when I can afford it.  Add any other free-form comments you care to, and I'll quote the interesting ones in the results.  Please reply directly to me to avoid spamming the list - I'll summarise the responses to the list. Feel free to pass this mail on to anyone who'd not on the list but who might be a likely respondent. I'll probably expand this to a web-based survey if the results are intriguing enough..

Though the event was great, being in the small town freaked me out.  I actually saw a bumper sticker that said 'First Iraq, Now France'.  And that's not the only nutso political expression I saw.  Ewwww.  Then on Monday, Duf and I drove to Chi, met up with Panda and spent a couple of beautiful, intimate hours with Chris Martin and his band.  You might know his band as 'Coldplay'.  I know them as 'HAL's Collection of Future Husbands'.  Thanks to Panda's efforts, we were on the floor just a few feet from the stage.  I thought Chris did a great job of playing the show just for me, while not making the rest of the crowd feel completely ignored.  I thought that I did a great job of expressing my enthusiasm, while not earning a restraining order.  Chris is a good guy, and a great dancer.  He wasn't as goofy as he was in Phoenix (no boy-band falsetto impressions this time), but all was forgiven when he got on his guitar and did his 'back and forth' move.  For me.  After the show, we caught a few zzz's before heading back to Minneapolis yesterday.  Panda was again the true trooper - she went to bed at 2, and got up at 4 to catch her plane to NYC.

The 8 hours of class are just too much.  Netflix says that they never got  Memento  back. Hmm... I mailed it... I hope it doesn't mean that someone jacked it? Well I just watched  Chocolat . Great movie... it's interesting. The modernism class really makes me examine the aspects of modernism in movies and life around me a lot more. How is Chocolat modern you might ask? There certainly is a battle between the traditional life that's very Victorian and the modern sensibilities that Vianne brings to the town. It's the idea that how you live life is an important aspect of living a good life. There's the notion of having the freedom to make your life a good one. I think there's an aspect of consumerism in it though. The fact that a specific commodity - chocolate - is what brings meaning to the lives of the people says something about how the film has modernist themes.  Now of course... I had a question that was brought up by Prof. Elbert's discussion about home decor. From what I remember from another history class... the Victorian home had 'souvenirs' that one gathered from things that you did. It can be argued that the Rothko replica was a souvenir, in that is has a 'memory' to it. It is true that its value as an original is gone as it is a replica that would later be replicated again in a film. How is 'memory' different in the Victorian era, from the Modern era?  In rotation lately has been some old school punk...  X  and  Dead Kennedys .  ***\n\nText 2:[14603]   First something a little more serious... my thoughts on the California Governor Recall. I guess the question is that if this is really democracy in action. In many ways I feel that it is democracy in action in that an unpopular governor in a state faced with serious financial problems may be removed from office. However, a fundamental problem with democracy is the mass media. Gray Davis's downfall has a lot to do with his poor playing of public relations and political forces taking advantage of that misplay. I remember an article in the LA Times early in his term discussing how he's laying so low that some people don't even know who he is. This allowed Republicans such as Issa to use the media machine against him. Then all of sudden people were talking about how bad Davis is. Arnold Scharzenegger on the other hand is playing the media to his advantage. Leaking news he might not run and then announcing his entry into the race on a talk show.   Here's my awkwardness with the whole thing. I am a fan of referendum and popular vote and I feel that many canidates (130 as of today) will make this election interesting. The media surrounding the whole thing could boost voter turn out. I mean with Arnold, Gary Coleman, Jack Grisham, Larry Flynt, etc. people will want to vote, because this time around it's kind of fun. However, the problem is that people can be sheep. That's why our country was made a republic and not a democracy. That's why referendums are rare in our country, unlike others. Our so-called founding fathers were for the most part fearful of the  demos  and people, yet they felt that sovereignty can only be based on common will. There's the tension right there. Will the people make the right choice? I'm not saying that what is right is what I believe in, but think about mobs. In mob sitatuations innocent people get hurt. Yet media coverage of things such as police violence (Rodney King, Rampart) created a positive uproar from the  demos .   I think this election is making people aware of what's going in the state, which is a good thing. Once people are aware, not even name power is enough. Let's hope people wake up and think about what they're doing and not get caught up in the media.  Ok to something less serious...  Mr. T Experience  rocks live. They played a great set and all 25 fans seemed to dig it. I thought Stay at Home Bomb was hilarious. Tossing twinkies at the audience and screaming 'you're fat' is just great satire.  ***"], "gold_label": 1.0}

I was in a local computer store the other day, and they had a small Apple Mac display over in the corner. It's one of these 'store within a store' concepts.  First of all, I took a look at a couple of PowerBooks. These are strange looking machines, as their LCD's are the wide-screen version. I go weak in the knees over large plasma television displays, but for some reason the wide laptop displays threw me off. It would take some getting used to I guess. The quality of the displays were gorgeous, however. I don't know if the Mac can display more colors than a typical Windows box, but these PowerBooks were certainly configured with some vibrant desktop wallpaper. The colors really stood out.  I saw some iBooks, and they really looked cheap. White plastic? Ugh. I guess if you're carrying an iBook around you stand out in a crowd, whereas all Windows laptops look alike. But still, didn't find much about the iBooks I liked visually.  Finally, I checked out the G5 display. Again, huge wide screen cinema display. The one button mouse felt odd in my hand, like I was missing a valuable shortcut. I am so used to right-clicking to bring up a popup menu I can't imagine a UI without one.   And here's the big relevation for me. I looked at the Mac OS X interface, and I was lost. The desktop was completely clear, only a finder at the bottom and a menu along the top. I didn't know where to click at first. It was almost like entering an empty room. 'What now?'  I finally clicked the little IE icon on the finder bar. Cool animation. The IE icon, instead of acting like a Windows button, bounced up and down for a second like a rubber ball. Someone spent a lot of time getting icons to do that. IE opened, and immediately gave me an error message because there was no Internet connection. But the error box was the prettiest thing I had ever seen. The OK button was pulsating, like a liquid orb of some sort. I didn't want to click it, I wanted to watch it pulsate for a little while. Someone spent a lot of time making that button pulsate.  Finally, I went to close IE. The upper minimize, maximize, close titlebar buttons each had their own color. When you moved the mouse over them, they animated. Wow. It reminded me that the Windows titlebar buttons have not changed in more than 10 years since Windows 3.1.  And all this, made me think ... the Mac is not the right computer for me. It's a work of art. Every thing about it has been thoroughly designed, with a great attention to detail. The box it ships in, the outer case of the computer itself, the monitor, every icon, every button and every pixel. The guy selling the computer is dressed in black. People that own Macs tend to love them like a member of their family.  It's a work of art, and art is meant to be watched, not used. I need a work tool. I need to get things done, and I don't care if the cardboard box it came in is brown. I don't care if the computer case is grey. I don't need a wide-screen (movie-theater style) monitor. My buttons do not have to pulsate or animate or anything. That's why the Mac will never gain wide acceptance. They have not sold people on the concept of a computer as a fashion accessory. 'Think different', they say? 'Just do it', I say.\n\nText 2:Today I heard a school secretary say to a little girl, 'Now, you're not going to get suspended anymore, are you?'  As I passed by the conversation I wanted to say, 'No, you're wrong.  This little GIRL wouldn't do something to get suspended.  I mean look at her, she's cute, well-dressed, calm, and polite.'  And then metacognition set in and I realized that I had just committed a mental act of sexism.  Our mothers might not understand why this scene might make us step back and take note of our place on the 'balance of the sexes.'  My mother didn't even begin college until I, her third child, was in elementary school.  And she is the only one of her sisters to have a college degree.  A few years ago, she got her Masters in Administration (approximately 1 year before I go my Masters), hoping to become a school principal.  It seems that her age has hindered those hopes, sexism replaced by ageism.  (My mom is older than my friends' parents.  She has a 39 year-old son after all.)  I'm not sure if this is really true, but she continued teaching and thanks to Bush's unfunded No Child Left Behind, she has, in fact, been left behind.  It now appears that she must have in hand a different type of Masters to do the same job she's been doing for 3 years.  But, I'm sure that 40 years ago she never would have thought she'd be worrying about what type of Masters Degree she had.  Former generations of women only hoped that women would have as many choices and possibilities that we do now, but with the entire world laid out before us, what do we really have but more questions?  What if we just want to be married and have children?  And that's it.  What if we want it that simple?  Is it sacrilege to not take advantage of the choices, or is that the whole point anyway?  I personally would feel no shame in dropping the 50,000 dollars and 20 plus years spent on my education to be a happy homemaker.  But, alas, baby making and the perfect spinach quiche are not the path I stumbled onto, nor will it be anytime in the near future.  After all, I have a research project due for my 'might turn into a PhD' class."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I've been having second doubts about my online journal.  I originally conceived this idea of having one during my freshman (or was it sophomore?) year:  to present the life experiences of a Christian in the modern day.  However, I didn't get a start on this page until www.blogger.com came out, because it tremendously simplified the process of posting while simultaneously giving me the freedom to present my site in any form I want.  However, at the time I was developing the site, I learned that web logging had been a phenomenon... man! I thought my idea was original.  Oh, but I digress.  My heart has been torn for the past couple of weeks in trying to define the line between artistic expression and sensitivity.  For example, if you've noticed for the past week, I've been trying to address what's been plaguing my heart for a very long time now:  one-sided emotional attachment.  When I first had the idea to record and display my thoughts and struggles on the subject, I questioned myself as to the appropriateness of it:  would it follow the vision of the site, while protecting the anonymity and feelinngs of the person in question?  I racked the situation in my mind and came to the conclusion that feelings will inevitably be hurt or disturbed by my expression.  But, I wanted to stay true to the vision:  this thing has been utterly consuming my mind, and if I want to be fully honest and vulnerable with my thoughts and experiences, I would be leaving out one of the biggest factors in my mental state to this day.  So, I started to communicate the reality of my consciousness, and it was quite a release to be able to communicate my grapple with my obsession; to me, it was definitely following the vision of the site.  This is the stuff that life is made out of.  This is the stuff that people go through.  This is the pain that, unfortunately, many of us go through, and I wanted to present my experience to show how Christ will work through it.  I still don't know how He will, but I know that He will.  But, isn't that pretentious?  As aforementioned, the person in question is inevitably uncomfortable and disturbed by my writings.  If stuck in the same position, who wouldn't be?  I tried to make it clear that it wasn't really herself but predominantly the obession that I was addressing, but I think a few times I did lose my judgement and did direct things her way.  This problem, then, brings to mind something that reddens me with shame:  am I so cowardly as to not deal with this with her personally?  Am I hiding behind my little pet project to deal with my pain?  Even worse, am I embarrassing this person in public?  She's never done anything wrong to me; in fact, she's always was been a good friend to me, and I've tried, albeit my feelings and this recent episode, to be a servant of Christ for her.  These ramifications grieve me.  What have I done?  Have I crossed the line?  The artist in me says, 'Ah! Controversy has stirred... that means what you're doing matters!  Think of the artists that you like, think of 'Creep' by Radiohead... isn't that a personal song?  Didn't Thom Yorke have to hurst someone with that song?'  Yes, but Radiohead can be pretentious.  Yes, but I'm not really much of an artist.  Who has any right to be pretentious, anyway? The super ego in me says, 'Ah! You megalomanic, you think this is about you?  You think you're at the center of attention?  Don't you care about others' feelings?'  I have no answer...  I'm at a loss inside for what it is I am to do.  I'm at a loss inside for what is the God-glorifying thing to do; have I mired myself in my flesh's thoughts so much, that I've clouded all of my judgement?  The fallen nature likes to sin, but it never likes the consequences.  The regenerated nature doesn't necessarily enjoy sin, and doesn't like the consequences.  The temptation:  why not just like it, instead of never be happy at all?  The answer:  the regenerated nature has a future, and has access to real Life, here on earth.  That's great... but... I'm still left in this position.  Have I gone too far?  Am I being to self-important with making a big deal in the first place?  The conclusion, when all has been heard, is:  I am a coward.\n\nText 2:This entire downloading issue is really annoying.

Something that's really been bothering me lately.  Linear time makes no sense.            Most of you have probably grown up with linear time, and don't know it any other way, so you'd probably be opposed to changing it.  And I'm not suggesting everyone be aware of all points in time simultaneously.  That would be mass chaos.  What I'm suggesting is that it makes more sense for people to control their own personal time.         Whether we want it to or not, the next thing to happen will happen next.  Friday will come after Thursday.  Two o'clock will come after one o'clock.  Causes will have immediate effects.  What if you had control over this.  Imagine if you could decide that you'd be in SRT than in biology class.  SRT would still come after biology, but you would perceive it as coming before.  If you put something in your pocket in Biology class, it would still be there in SRT.  It's just your perception of events that would change.        You may complain this would cause paradoxes.  Well, it would.  But only if used irresponsibly.  If overused it would get quite confusing.  The other danger would be the thrill seeker who lived every fun moment immediately and then had only sorrow for the rest of his life.  But, if used correctly, this ability would completely eliminate stress.       Do you get any of this, or am I just rambling?  If you do, that's great.  If not, it just goes to prove that everything I think about that's not inane is insanely complicated.       Bad puns excluded, of course.\n\nText 2:Alternate Title: Today's the Day!

Yes, I have been gone for a while due to my StinkPad dying on me.  I have since replaced the StinkPad with a  urlLink Gateway computer  ; I broke down and bought a 2.4Gig Celeron MooTop and I love it!  I saved $200 by buying the Celeron and it's so much better than the StinkPad was.  The stats are as follows: 2.4 Celeron, 512 Ram, 40 Gig HD, 24X DVD/CD-RW drive and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't mean anything to me.  I love this computer!!   The GTI should be fixed by Wednesday; woohoo!  I'm feeling squirrely about driving him certain places, but oh well.  Shit happens, and I'll be so happy to have a dependable car again; I'm not going to know what to do!!   Is anyone else irritated by the MCI Neighborhood commercials?  The singer guy sounds like he has a mouthful of shit.  Stop trying so damn hard to sound 'soulful' and sing like a normal person.  It's a long distance commercial for godsakes.   Type O Negative at the Cleveland Odeon on Friday November 21st!  Cradle of Filth is closing the show; I've never seen them live but I do enjoy their music so I'll stick around for their show too.  Then it's more TON/COF in December; one show in Pittsburgh (not at the Metropol; they closed!) and one show in Detroit.  That will rock!   School is pretty much shot to shit due to my inability to get back to WV.  I missed one whole week during the Queensryche fiasco in October, and I'm going to wind up missing almost two weeks this time.  What's really pissy about it is I had straight A's in all of my classes, and I'm going to pay $6300 (loans) for nothing.  Dammit!  No point in getting all worried about it though, as it's out of my control.   Halloween turned out to be quite fun.  Sherri, Christi, Candi, Sarah, Jess, Angie and I went to the Glenville graveyard to visit Sis Lin and to check things out; mind you this is around 12:30 in the morning and we stayed there until almost 3AM.  We were going up the nature trail and I got really weirded out for some reason.  Everyone who knows me is aware that I don't scare easily.  I hightailed it back to the fountain in the middle of campus; Christi and Jess were waiting there on the rest of us as they didn't want to go on the nature trail with us.  They both said I was white as a sheet when I exited the woods, which I totally believe.  I saw something in the woods that night that I can't explain. We went to the Weston Sanitarium on Saturday for a ghost tour.  That was cool as hell, and some weird shit happened there too.  I'll post some photos and the videos I shot at the Sanitarium into my  urlLink Yahoo briefcase   so everyone can see them as well.  Sarah and I enhanced some of the videos and photos and there's some really freaky shit in them.  As soon as I remember to email Sarah for them, I'll upload those photos into my briefcase as well.     Tomorrow is Friday!  I plan on doing some mall crawling at Belden Village and generally messing around.  I need to pay my cell phone bill, and mail out my eBay refunds as well.  Two months and the damn post office hasn't contacted me regarding the insurance claims I filed.  I have to refund over $400 out of my own pocket even though it's the post office's fault the packages were lost.  The PO sucks!!   I am getting rid of the BaronBomb.  I can't get legal plates on it as the car is still in my Dad's name and it is still overheating.  I just paid $500 to have a new radiator and water pump installed and it still overheats!  It's actually worse than it was before I had that work performed.  I HATE THAT CAR!  Soon I will be Baronless and it will feel nice!  My insurance will also drop another $50 a month.  I haven't seen $50 a month car insurance for a long, long time.  It'll be a nice change from $153 a month insurance.  Six of my eight points came off of my license so that helped too (dropped it from $153 to $103/month), but getting the BaronBomb off of my insuarnce policy will be great.  This is the smartest thing I've done in a while; too bad I didn't think of it before my Dad plunked $3000 into an engine!   OK, that's enough of an update for today.  More later!\n\nText 2:Well now, wasn't I Miss Productivity today?  I washed my clothes, cleaned my room, cleaned out my car, checked the oil and the antifreeze, cleaned all of the car windows, Swiffered the dash and doors and made iced tea.  Damn, I rock.  Dr. Dork's Mom washed his wallet tonight.  I think that's one of the funniest things she's ever managed to do.  Usually she just bleaches his clothes, so this washing of the wallet is excellent.  I told him if he'd wash his own clothes these things wouldn't happen.  Besides, he's carried that wallet for 11 or 12 years and it was pretty damn tattered.  Heehee!  Tomorrow is the first car show of the season.  Originally Saturday would have been the first show at Kempthorn Auto Mall, but it rained yesterday so I didn't attend that show.  The first car show is in  urlLink Cuyahoga Falls at Front Street  .  They've renovated all of Front Street so I'm sure it'll be really nice.  They have Rockin on the River every Friday evening as well, but I think it'll be impossible for me to attend anymore since I work late on Friday evenings.  That's OK, as Rockin on the River is nicknamed Drunkin on the River for a good reason; mostly it's old drunk people staggering around and being stupid.  No good bands announced so far, therefore I'm not missing much.  I'm off to watch Helter Skelter.  That is all."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Sometimes I can be happy, other times I can be sad. But who isn't like that? I mean there's no one whose happy 24/7. But sometimes it seems like I'm the only person crying out for help. Sometimes it seems like I don't fit into this world. But other times I'm fine, I'm normal, I'm happy. Right now i'd have to say that my life is awesome, only because I found someone special, someone who I love and cannot be without. But what happens when that is gone? What would I do? How would I deal with myself? You see I love Brandon so much, I could never let go. It's to the point that I could never ever imagine us breaking up. But I shouldn't think about this, breakin up and all. Cause I don't wanna break up with him, i'm just worried, what if? I guess I worry too much, that's my problem. I try to keep a happy image to where no one can see how I feel at the time, but it's hard. I know it's not good, I keep it all inside myself. It builds up day after day, month after month. Until it finally is too much, and I can't handle it, I just explode and say things I don't mean. Usually this happens towards the end of my school year. It's happened for the last, I'd say 3 years. No matter how hard I try to stop it, it never works. But this year I feel is different. I'm in highschool now, away from all the bullshit. I can be the person I've wanted to be for a really long time, not trying to impress anyone. So there it is...some of what I go through in life.  SOME  is the main word. There's no way I could ever explain everything, but I can try. But for now it seems all good, I hope it stays this way. I'm just gonna have to hold on tight, hold on to what I have, and not let it slip away.\n\nText 2:hey all im happy! lol and yes adam and i did talk last night on the phone (: i decided to call him and were cool now so i am quite excited and feel tons better! i just told him that i wanted to be friends that hes a really cool guy that i luv talkin with. yaaaaa!!!!  so anyways i woke up thisa mornin had a bagel and then watched office space in which i have never watched and heard that it was really good. and in deed it was a good movie. i also last night watched super troopers which was hilarious as i aslo heard. ive been renting good movies lately ive realized. next i think ill get 'fight club' if they have it in and 'from hell' with johnny depp!  today i get to go to the pool and do water drills and practice in case of an emergency happens. tha'll be interesting, and like i said at least i get paid. blake will be there, god i hate him. u kno i used to have a crush on him cause of course i thought he was really hott and was a pretty cool guy. and ryan keeps on botherin me sayin i kno that if blake and his gf werent together ud be tryin to get with him at any second. and that relly makes me mad because blake&nbsp;has gotten really annoying and i just have given up. also i cant even trust him with tellin him anything cause then he goes and tells other ppl, like maybe my boss's. i kno that me and allie hate him officially and there may even be more ppl that&nbsp;i dont kno of. stop complainin danette, i really need to stop.  ill be back later if i have anything else to say, but i have to say i am in a good mood other than im annoyed with blake. im happy that me and adam can still be friends cause thats all i want right now (: blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:"], "gold_label": 1.0}

This morning I arose bright and early to get to my new pseudo-occupation at the Baptist Cancer Institute. It was actually quite fun: the morning opened up with a breast cancer session, followed by several hours of reading up on breast and colorectal cancer, followed at noon by a general tumor council, specifically targeting the growth of blood vessels to colon tumors. They provided lunch with the noon session. All in all, rather enjoyable. Dr. Neese and Dr. Fowler are wonderful people to work with.  I have spoken to the owner of the Butcher Shop, who, incidentally, is a very good friend from our old neighborhood. He assured me that he could find some openings in several restaurants, maybe even in the Butcher SHop. A wonderful chap, Mr. Hughes.  SAT II's saturday. Gag me with a butcher knife.  I am overjoyed to realize I have been dreaming of late. At least, I can remember my dreams to an extent. In any case, that makes me happy. I remember that one last night included Elise, and she was driving her car. It was a happy dream, I remember that. Also, I had one today whilst I was sleeping after finishing the noon conference at Baptist. I remember I was with some female that I cannot remember at some rock concert thing, and it was exhilerating and strangely romantic and I enjoyed it immensely.

God, help me.\n\nText 2:'Weirdness!'  I had this dream last night that my old roommate and I were living in an apartment in some city; I couldn't tell which one it was, let's say it's NY.  We're hosting a party, but I couldn't find anything in the fridge that would work together to whip up snacks.  But, I found a lot of cheese, and I thought to myself, 'hey, fondue is always good.'  So we went downstairs to go shopping, and along the way I saw Christine Choy and Hanna Lee walking together.   Weird, they haven't lived together since sophomore year , I thought, but I walked up to greet and ask Christine what we would need for fondue.  'Jack cheese, fresh mozarella, and white wine.' I scratched my head, wondering how mozarella would work in fondue, but she seemed to know about these things.  I turned to found no one standing there.  Confused, I looked around, but to no avail: gone.  In the meantime, Christine and Hanna invited me over.  It was weird, they were living in someone else's house, and were renting out one room.  Their room was dolled up very nicely, I must add.  By this point I forgot about why I had left the apartment, and I forgot that I couldn't find my roommate.   Why did I leave? Oh yeah, I left to go to orientation.   That's when the dream changed.  I went to orientation (for what, I have no idea), and as I was exploring the school after it was over, I found that Angela Chung was having a concert in this big hall packed to the full.  After it was over, I yelled to her.  She turned and turned and couldn't find me, so she told me to put my elbow on my head.  I did, so she found me, and that was fun.  My youth group kids were there, too, after the concert.  That was stranger.  I then woke up and took a shower, and this song was on repeat in my head:  'In my dream, I was drowning my sorrows But my sorrows they'd learned to swim Surrounding me, going down on me Spilling over the brim Waves of regret and waves of joy. I reached out for the one I tried to destroy. You, you said you'd wait till the end of the world.'  --  Until the End of the World  - U2  I haven't had a good night's worth of sleep all weekend.  I go to bed hoping that I'd feel better, only to wake 6-8 hours later feeling like I had stayed up all night.  My limbs have no energy to move, my heart beats too fast.  Darnit, this stinks.  I have homework due today and a test next week, and other classes to catch up in.  I think I have to drop some courses.  Everything's been too difficult for me to handle:  re-adjusting to school life and to life at home church, this weekend's events, the demanding workload.  God, this is harder than ever.  What's the thing I'm supposed to do?  I can sense now what You want me to do, but it's too hard for me to sense it reliably with all these emotions running amuck inside.  All along, this pain has resurfaced in my chest.   Heh, it never takes a break long enough for me to recuperate... but I just have to get on with it, or else I'll sink deeper."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I bet mine was 100000000000000 times worse than yours! Not only have I had it for a week now but i don't have an eyeappointment for another 2 weeks. An dto top that off when I was bending ove rto pick something up off teh floor in my room I whacked my head on the side of bed (has a this wooden thing around the edge) and now have a dent in it as well as a added to headache. Hmph. But I thought it was very nice to come in, put on the internet for a quick spin on my usual message boards and blogs to find that all my cool Ryan fans are really lovely and nice and don't argue with me for the sake of it. In fact they are all relaly suportive of each other, really helpful and are happy to help each other out. Then my cousin was on msn and it was cool talking to him as he is in North Carolina. His wife, dawn, has an interview tomorrow and if she gets the job they will be moving to....ready....CHICAGO! Wahoo! They are both really lucky!!! Brilliant. have to go and visit them then. :)\n\nText 2:wow is it wednesday already?  lets see.  saturday will was gone forever at his friend's bachelor party..what did i do? ah yes work on my stupid paper, im much much happier with it than my original one. oh yes and my friend tiff from LA was in the bay area visiting that weekend so she dropped by for a bit to hang out.  she was telling me of some girls from my high school, like how some of them had kids already.  and like i was really really surprised!  but i guess i shouldnt be..some people are just like that...i dunno, i just think that before anyone has kids they should be in a stable and strong relationship and have like some sort of future going for them...its hard to have a kid at such a young age, like i would think you'd be missing out on lots of things you can do when you're still young u know? but hey if you're responsible and you planned the pregnancy then power to you.  if you're responsible and didn't plan the baby, well...then there's harder decisions to be made.  oh and she told me about this girl that was in playboy!  i guess im not too surprised, she had a nice body and wasnt exactly the high school valedictorian u know? so make money the way you can i guess?  anyway, it was fun like gossiping about people from high school.  i dunno, i dont really keep in touch with people from my high school era haha, only a select few!  im sure it'll be pretty crazy when like some high school reunion comes around, i wonder how much certain people would have changed.  do they have 5 year reunions?  that would be next year i guess.  we'll see!  ooh so we went to the driving range on monday, i was doing a lot better than last time!  i actually hit it into the nearest green! yah its not THAT far, but for me its a huge accomplishment.  like i want to get better at golf, but i just dont have the time.  my unemployment runs out in like 2 months so im kinda worried bout my financial situation.  like im going to attempt (ATTEMPT!) to start with 4 upper division ee courses, but if i'll actually end with 4? who knows.  so im not sure if i want to get a job and take away time that i should be studying u know?  but then i need the money!  i saw in the daily cal yesterday that they're looking for a hostess at this pool hall like down the street from where i live.  i wonder how much the pay is.  this job wouldn't exactly help me in my career field though haha.    today in my e190 class we were discussion this article about how engineers these days are too narrow minded in the sense that all they know is technical information, and not enough emphasis is being placed on humanities and stuff.  its amazing listening to some of the engineers in my section how stuck up some of them can be.  of course we're all in it for the money right? but still, some of these guys man...i was pretty disgusted.  i think the teacher was getting annoyed too.  of course im in it for the money- like i have any REAL interest in engineering?  yah sounds really shallow but its somewhat true!  my favorite thing to do is to shop- sad but true...and i need a good job to do my shopping!  like people in jobs like nursing and stuff, sure thats great if you like to help people (which everyone should want to do in a perfect world) but its not going to get the bills paid for big time shopping.  but at least some of the classes im going to be taking this coming fall semester sound interesting, and i actually have interest in taking them!  all EE, no CS.  i hate CS man!!  i wish there were more math classes i could take..math seems to be my thing recently..too late!  so this weekend we might go to marine world!  andy can get tickets for like half off.  we're still considering though.  last time i went i think was with shirley/christian and i dont remember that place being so great.  hm wait- maybe we went to great america with them and marine world with fei/phil.  who remembers everything is so blurry!  but i dont really remember either of those amusement parks being that fun...but at half off it could be considered!  will's going to play golf on sunday.  and then next week is going to suck crazilY!  i have to give another presentation on monday- this time its about EAS systems (electronic article surveillance)..u know...like at libraries or clothes stores they have those pedestals at the exit/entrance that'll beep if some stupid worker there forgets to deactivate the tag?  i think mostly its out of incompetence!  and then i have a final paper and my cs final due.  its going to be a long week.  but the weekend after that is will's friend will's wedding.  dunno what im going to wear.  they're having a rehearsal for the wedding party on friday night, and then a rehearsal dinner after that.  like i got an invite for the rehearsal dinner, which sounds fun.  but if will's already going to be in SF for the rehearsal i dunno if i want to drive by myself out to SF just for the dinner.  i hate driving in SF.  the church the wedding is going to be at- st. ignacius or something? i looked at the website and it is HUGE!!  i heard its going to be huge wedding too! that should be fun.  but i dunno who im going to be sitting with cuz will's a groomsman.  we'll see.  we have a cs project due on friday. fun fun.  i have so no interest in my stupid CS class..its like pulling teeth. hehe.  just get it over with damnit!  ok i guess i'll do some reading for it..ugh..be back later!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Today, I went to NYC and hung out with an old college friend.  I caught 'The Triplets of Belleville,' and loved it.  I also tried to get stuff for my guitar and a new bag, but ended up getting an MD player that stores mp3s.  Ate at Lombardi's, again.  During the evening, I went to Kim (last name, Situ?)'s birthday, and met some new people from Remnant.  Fun stuff.  Funniest sight:  I saw a guy carrying a live DUCK wearing a mini Green Bay packers helmet.  The guy looked really angry and stern in his Green Bay jacket, while the duck confusedly looked around the subway terminal.  Weird.  It took me a while to get home.  I tried out the NetMD player, and found this product to be extremely problematic.  Once again, Sony hasn't surprised me in showing how ridiculous they are.  It says on the box that it can play mp3s and wmas, but I realized now that it simply converts it to ATRAC, the proprietary MD sound format.  It makes it extremely difficult to transfer mp3s to the MD player, it slows down the transfer process due to the conversion time, you CAN'T UPLOAD your own recordings using this faster interface, and you MUST use their proprietary software to transfer music.    Boo on all counts, Sony.  What would have been good?  Well, it would have been good to simply enable your MD player to decode mp3s, wav's, and wma's directly, like most MP3 players on the market.  It would have been good to simply make the MD player like a portable drive, so that it can have more uses than music, just like most mp3 players on the market.  It would have been good to not require the use of the proprietary software, but no, I guess you have to protect the best interests of your music industry division.  I have fully legal mp3s, backed up from my CD collection, and you make it very hard to get it onto the discs.  Boo.  Didn't Sony learn from the Beta disaster?  Why are they so overprotective and conservative?  Why not adapt the MD disc to hold normal data?  It's killing them because their products aren't so great anymore.  I still need this, but they sure screwed up this time.  I sure screwed up this time, with this purchase.  I got too excited with the prospects of a cheaper alternative to iPod and etc, and of using my old MD player materials and discs.  Greedy, is more like it, and I really got ahead of myself with this impulsive, unwise, and bad buy.  Shame, I have a lot of lessons to learn from this day.\n\nText 2:'Adios'  For you Spanish-speaking folk out there, I have a question.  Is the farewell 'adios' an abbreviation of 'a Dios,' so that when you are saying bye, you are saying 'to God' to whomever is leaving?  What is the etymology of the word?  Oh, wait.  I looked up the etymology in www.dictionary.com, and indeed, it comes from 'to God.'  It is synonymous with the french farewell, 'adieu,'  and both are derived from the Latin 'ad deus.'  Isn't it interesting that the farewell for both languages comes from a phrase wishing you to go to God as you leave?"], "gold_label": 0.0}

The other places had electronic apps, but we did not have enough time to go to them all due to the fact that Shawn, we all remember who that is right? :O), had to work this evening.  So we ran our other errands there and headed on home. Home was not so bad because everyone went off to do their own thing. I did have to wash a buttload of dishes in the sink though. I wonder what their going to do when Shawn and I move? Oh, well, Not my worry :O)  We also purchased a webcam today (for $30) and it kicks a**! Well at least I hope it does. I have not actually used it yet :O( I practically had to nag the darn thing out of Shawn!! LOL I just hope his family does not try and take the webcam from me.

I still have a few left over in the old pack so I am still keeping to my one pack a week rule :O) I plan on gradually cutting down on my smoking until I can quit all together :O)  The mailman put our mail in the wrong box again!

Remember the Ayatollah Khomaini and the American hostages he held for so long? Remember the war between Iran and Iraq? Saddam at that point was our 'friend' because he was the Ayatollah's enemy, and if Reagan armed him it was in our national interest. But remember when Saddam literally kidnapped the country Kuwait? In national and humanitarian interests, President Bush severely chastised our former 'friend' and restored Kuwait its freedoms, indeed, its nation. For a while afterwards, there was good reason for Americans to help Iraq rebuild and to reestablish vital connections to its oil supply, though we now knew Saddam was not our 'friend'. And after 9/11, with the whole world knowing that Saddam had used biological and other weapons on a half million of his own people and according to available intelligence was planning to develop nuclear capability while he played a ten year 'shell game' with the UN, it made sense to take some preemptive action. Or would you rather just wait till the next 9/11 and the next? It rants on and on from there in typical Liberal fashion. Read it if you want. I suggest that you do."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I did it almost two years ago and am still learning.  I quickly came to enjoy, and rely on, having a local Apache/MySQL/PHP environment for development, but found that once a site went live I became more tied to the production server than I wanted. It was slowing me down, too, because of the workarounds needed to 1) keep work in progress isolated from live code and 2) integrate that work when testing was complete.  To remedy that situation I've been using rsync, with great success.  I set up offline mirrors of live sites I'm working on, complete with their own MySQL databases and local-only virtual domains (e.g. 'bigfancyclient.dev'). I tweak code with abandon and then, when it's all working perfectly (ahem), I upload the changes to the production server in one step -- using a shell script containing a couple long-ass rsync commandlines.  For those new to rsync, basically my rsync commands say: 'here's the development mirror A; here's the live server B; take every file in the following directories on A that's newer than its counterpart on B and upload it, saving the old one as a backup.'  Sometimes even a 'simple' change involves interdependent changes to half a dozen files in different directories. I don't have to keep track. rsync finds them all. I also have a 'dry run' version that has the same commands with the addition of the '-n' option that does everything except actually transfer the files -- for a last-minute sanity check.  (Note 1: In theory you could accomplish the same thing by just uploading everything, but in practice this doesn't work except with very small sites.  And if you get around this by selecting which directories or files to upload, well, then you are manually doing the work that rsync can do faster and more accurately.)  (Note 2: This is clearly best suited to smaller operations.  With many developers working at once, you want something like CVS. Though rsync can of course sync in either direction, so I can update my mirrors when other developers or HTML coders make changes to the live server.)  rsync has a jillion options, so if this sounds at all appealing I encourage you to curl up with the manpage.  I have used lots of other methods for making code changes to live sites; for efficiency, ease, and safety this beats them all hands down.

In general, we have two words to describe a body type:  thin/fat; tall/short/; etc.  We are a culture of extremes and linguistically-enforced simplicity.  Our language is so pitiful that we often resort to numbers to express ourselves ('Are you happier today?' 'In terms of happy I'm about a 6, maybe a 7.')  For all the praise Indo-European languages receive, more often than not our choices are woefully limited.  Unfortunately, being creatures of language, how we speak and communicate greatly shapes our reality.  And so the wars begin -- often because our limited language limits our thinking, and thus our options.  No poetry, no grace -- only simple, concrete linguistic containers into which we attempt to pour the whole of our experience.  I love my car.  I love my wife.  I hate this pizza.  I love my house.  I love this carpet.  I hate that tie.  I hate war.  I hate flying.  I love my parents.  I hate the quiet.

Figure out what you're medicating, and find something larger than yourself to hope or work toward.  It's never easy; there is no cure for addiction, only a lifetime of vigilance.\n\nText 2:Oops, good point, Ben - I never said who I was. Hello, everyone, I'm Nick.  My connection is via Eva - she wickedly seduced me one stormy night in Wales and has come to the UK (my homeland) to haunt my every waking hour - and the occasional one when I'm asleep, too.  I'm a stand-up comic by trade (that's what I was doing in Wales. Eva has far less excuse.).  Don't have a website, I'm afraid, but there's a British comedy website called chortle and I'm reviewed/listed  urlLink there .  Just so as not to be completely disregarding recent topics, the situation here in the UK with regards to elections is that you can take time off work to vote - not the whole day, but half a morning or something - and your employer has to let you.  I think that only applies in general elections, though (the big ones where you're voting in a new government [actually it doesn't quite work like that here, but a full explanation would take me too far from the point]).  I don't think it applies for small, local elections - which is a shame, in a way, since those are the ones where your vote counts most and you have more of a chance to really change things. It seems to me that most of our big elections (in both countries) really only afford the public the chance to ratify elite decisions; they keep the population distanced from actual policy formation whilst providing the comforting illusion that our leaders are answerable to us.  On one level they are, of course, since we can vote them out (when we're allowed to every few years) - but really those changes are pretty cosmetic.  I think the limits of the system are shown up in the following hypothesis: Let's say you introduce mandatory voting, so that there's a 95% turnout. The elected government can claim quite a legitimacy with the mandate of a genuine majority of the population. Or it would, if not for the fact that the people are effectively coerced into making the choice. So to avoid this, a 'None of the above' option is introduced. So far, so democratic.  Now, here's the dilemma: What happens if a majority of the voting population goes with the 'None of the above' choice?  Nobody running for power can legitimately take office, since the people have expressed definitely that they don't want the candidates, but you can't just leave the government empty.  What do you do? As far as I can see the system fails at this point. The powers that be can't really allow the electorate a full and comprehensive democratic choice, since there's the risk that people might use it, and that's not really what the electoral system is for.  Of course, there's already the option of not voting, or spoiling your vote, but that's fine provided those choices don't HAVE to be interpreted as 'None of the above'.  And to be honest, often a more realistic interpretation of not voting might be, 'Mmmmm... My bed's comfy.' Oops. A bit of a rant. Did Eva warn you about my tendency to do that?  To recap: 1. Hello, everybody, nice to meet you. and 2. I read too much Chomsky."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Breaking news: we were turned down for an apartment in NoHo [North Hollywood]. It was our first. I could just scream: ' I have money... lots of it... take it! Now '! But, I don't suppose that would do much else besides scare away the landlords. I dropped off more applications for another apartment just a few feet away from the place mentioned above - Billy and Chuck still have to fax in their info, before the lady will even look at us. So, since that is anything but promising, I have been calling every apartment in the area, and time is running out fast. Only seven more days... maybe eight. It's getting down to the wire. I did however have one pleasant conversation on the phone with a landlord today - a nice guy named Ted, another place over by NoHo. Anyways, enough my running in circles.  Amanda is at work right now, she got a job at a snoody clothing store for 30'somethings in the mall, a place called  urlLink j.jill ... she hates it though, her boss is a real power hungry snob, who after walking Amanda around the store for an hour, showing her which [overpriced] cloths she should buy to: 'look the part', told Amanda that if she had interviewed her first; she wouldn't have hired her. Even though she kinda' did interview her first, but that's besides the point.   I had an interview at Kinko's yesterday for an opening during the graveyard shift, but that didn't go so well. To explain: Amanda's interview was at 2 pm, I dropped off a resume and was asked to come in at 3:30 pm. So these two interviews are less then 10 minutes down the street from each other, the thought that an hour and a half wasn't enough time never even crossed our minds. But the [ expletive deleted ] interviewing Amanda had to take her shopping for an hour and screwed it all up. I was hoping Amanda would walk any second, Amanda hoped I had already left, I didn't know the number or the street name it was on. And you get the idea: I showed up late. They weren't impressed. I'm still unemployed.   But, I have an interview tomorrow afternoon at  urlLink Nielsen Entertainment , thanks to Tricia (whom we're staying with at the moment), she works there doing box office research [among other things]. She has been helping out a lot... a lot, a lot. Yesterday she came home with a job list for interns, one of those 'underground list (you can only get if you know someone who knows someone)'. So that of course is: 'crap-my-pants exciting'. Then ontop of this favor, she helped my write a resume last night, along with a cover letter that she assured me looked great [she said she reads thousands of them]. So I spent a while last night emailing my cover letter & resume to people on the list, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\n\nText 2:first day off  Well, it's been six days but I finally have a day off to myself where I can relax. I'm not used to that kind of non-stop schedule [I know; I'm a baby]. I'm reading a book right now a friend from work lent to me; 'Che Guevara - a revolutionary life'. I'm not that far into it, and so far it's reading a bit like a high school history book, but I was warned about that and reassured that it gets much better. I realized I didn't know much of anything about Che, but the person who lent me the book said that he is her hero, and that she has read the book three times [and you can tell by looking at the book... it's seen better days].     Above: Here's a pic that should have been posted months ago, we are at the top of a Santa Monica parking structure.   I have some imported footage from Amanda and I's trip out here that I'm going to post on here soon, I would do it now, but we are reaching our max-bandwidth limits [again]. So I will just wait till the month resets. I have almost an hour of footage so I'll have to break it up, and I want to put a short clip of our beta fish, Adam, who just recently passed :( He somehow jumped up and out of his fish bowl and he was found dried up on the floor in our bedroom. Very strange. Chuck and Amanda said their goodbyes and flushed him down the toilet while I was at work.  Oh, while I'm thinking about it; does anyone out there know how to take basically a lamp and make it run off of batteries? Do I just use a ac/dc converter? Can I just cut off the plug and connect the wires to a battery? Does this all sound crazy? Chuck and I were discussing filming something at night, and I want to make what would basically be a boom-mic and make a boom-lite... so to speak.

The principal, vice-principal, superintendant, student council president, and the head prefects spoke to us before we went to take a tour of the school with the assigned prefects. The barbeque there was okay. Met a lot of friends from BHES, and SSPS. Friends that used to come to RRPS was now in SSPS and we met up and talked. Same old Timothy, JinWoo, Danny [aka PC], Anthony, Eric, Amin, Edan, and Kammie. Some things never change... Haha. They're a great bunch to hang out with. I miss them. Blah. I'll see 'em in BSS next year! Haha. There were so many bugs at the barbeque. Scaryness. Hmm, saw Joel there too. Talked to him a bit. Wanted him to teach me how to say 'See ya later' in Korean. Damn, he wouldn't teach me. Lazy butt. Haha! Blah.  I talked to some people during lunch and stuff. Including Tracy's mom. Dunno why she talked to me but yeah. I'll keep what she said to me in mind. Talked to some other people including Moca and Zoe and people. Very interesting... Blah. I'll know what to do and stuff. Haha. Told Nima not to play basketball at recess since he did so much yesterday and kinda hurt himself. He didn't listen. Oh well. Whatever. Do what you want. I'm definitely gonna go for guitar next year. I dunno... I wanna try vocals though. Might join the choir. I know I don't sing well but I wanna try to improve what little I know about singing. My mom would never let me get vocal lessons anyway. Oh well, whatever. Might get Brian to join our band 'cos of his keyboard/piano skills. It's a good idea. Moca doesn't think he's the 'band' type but whatever. I'm gonna ask if he wants to come to our next band practise.  To be honest, I don't really think Safee is... you know. Didn't scream the way I thought he would. Like Chester. From Linkin Park, I mean. So anyway... maybe a little more hoarser? I don't know. Whatever. I'm no singing/screaming expert.   Hmm, Hillsongs concert or Blink-182 concert? I wanna go to both but I don't think I'll be allowed. Hillsongs is a Christian band and Blink-182 is just rock. Iunno. I'll think about it. Damn, the Hillsongs concert is tomorrow, I think. I wanna go!  Just spoke to my sister about Megha. What a weird little girl. She's gotta learn that you can't just go up to someone and tell them that you think their boyfriend's hot. Whatever.  Julie told me it was Dan's birthday this weekend. Cool. I'm gonna go tell him happy birthday whenever it is. Haha.   This coming Saturday we're going to Wonderland. Yup. It's gonna be cool. So many people going. Blah. I just don't like line-ups. Haha! Oh well. Whatever.   You know what? I noticed that I like the phrase 'whatever' a lot. Yay. Anyway... so yeah.  Stayed after school with Nima and we just... walked around. After Octi and stuff. He and Boris were supposed to fight but they called it off. Weirdos. So yeah. Nima walked me home and yeah. I think my neighbors saw us hug. LoLzZ~! Well whatever. My mom knows about it so yeah. Even if they tell my mom it's like: '...Okay, and...?'  Blah. Oh well. I'm so bored. Blogging again. Haha! I started this blog entry around 4:30-ish and now it's 5:15 lmao! Weird. Anyway... Nima found my lost_diary account on fanfix and yeah. He said he wouldn't read it if I told him not to and yeah. I trust him. If he says he's not gonna read it then okay.   Nikki and Moca had this fight again. Jeez, people's gotta learn to chillax. Talk calmly instead of screaming. Nikki... I don't like her attitude. She's changed a lot and a lot of stuff she says and stuff bugs me. It all just started with the whole Persian pride thing. Same with Moca. She's changed a little and it's not for the better. Or maybe I'm the one whose changed? I don't know. But... I feel like I'm growing apart from Moca. Oh well.

Well, with Friends ending yesterday in the US and over here on the 28th of May, T4 are running a competition. Usually, I pay no attention to these ('Who won Pop Idol? A. Will Young, B. Will Hague, C. Will Shakespeare') but this one got me thinking, because it's right out of High Fidelity.  Name your Top 6 Friends Episodes.  Ouch.  So, after a week of ruminating and congugating, here are the six episodes that I feel are my favourite. Feel free to insult my choices and pick your own in the comments box below.   Season 1 - TOW The Blackout  The first episode where, for me, Friends changed from 'another US sitcom' to a great comedic series. A blackout causes Chandler to end up stuck in a bank vestibule, or atrium, with a model. Ross acts on Joey's advice to ask Rachel out, resulting in him being attacked by a cat, which causes more problems when the cat's owner shows up.  There are so many great lines in this, with Chandler trying to find ways to look cool and not creepy, as well as Ross's worrying about Rachel (for the record, I liked Season 1 Ross but didn't like him so much in the whole R&R thing, not recovering until his breakdown in Series 5).   Favourite Lines:  Chandler: 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said, 'gum would be nice,' or, 'I'll have a stick,' but no-no-no-no-no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.  =   Season 3 - TOW The Football  It's Thanksgiving. A friendly game of touch football takes a nasty turn as Chandler and Joey argue over a Dutch girl and Rachel wants to prove herself at sports. The atmosphere grows tenser as the ultimate prize is unveiled - The Gellar Cup.  A great episode that shows the bizarre relationship between Ross and Monica and Joey starts his decent from moron into uber-moron.   Favourite Lines:  Chandler: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?  =   Season 4 - TOW The Embryos  Phoebe has her brother's embryos implanted. However, this becomes secondary as a bet is made between Chandler and Joey against Monica and Rachel over who knows each other best. The stakes - ownership of Monica and Rachel's apartment and the chick and the duck. The quizmaster - Ross.  I don't feel the need to explain this one too much - it's the quiz one. It rules.   Favourite Lines  Ross: Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job? Rachel: Oh! Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers. Monica: And processing! Rachel: Oh, well... and he carries a briefcase! Ross: Ten seconds. You need this or you lose the game. Monica: It's, um, it has something to do with transponding. Rachel: Oh, oh, oh, he's a transpons... transponster! Monica: That's not even a word!  =   Season 5 - TOW Ross's Sandwich  Ross's decent into madness continues when someone steals his sandwich and he turns to Phoebe for advice. Joey has to explain items that Chandler leaves behind so not to reveal Chandler's relationship with Monica, leading Phoebe and Rachel to believe he is a pervert. Phoebe and Rachel take a literature course.  Ross going nuts is just downright funny and this is the best example, Joey taking the blame is great and Phoebe setting up Rachel makes what could have been a weak 'Give them something to do' story a real asset to the episode ('It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.')   Favourite Lines:  Ross: Really? So... so what would you say, Pheebs? Stuff like, uh, 'Keep your mitts off my grub?' Chandler: Say, Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?  =   Season 5 - TOW Everyone Finds Out  Rachel and Phoebe discover Chandler and Monica's secret, so Phoebe is sent on a mission to seduce Chandler to expose the affair. This results in Chandler being sent on a counter-mission by Monica to throw them off the scent. In the end everyone finds out, except Ross who has just bought the apartment across the street from Monica...  This episode, like TOW The Embryos, is great down to one real thread - Phoebe and Chandler's game of Seduction 'Chicken' ('So, this is my bra'). Plus, Ross goes nuts at the end.   Favourite Lines:  Phoebe: They thought they could mess with us! They're trying to mess with us? They don't know that we know they know we know! And Joey, you can't say anything! Joey: I couldn't if I wanted too.  =   Season 8 - TOW The Videotape  The fallout of Rachel's pregnancy leads to an argument about who seduced whom. Luckily, Ross taped the night. Chandler and Monica are worried that a couple they met on honeymoon may be giving them the brush-off.  What I like about this one is how a load of seamingling meaningless comments ('Hi, Ken Adams. Nice to meet you') and the two main stories come together for a great denouement. A funny episode due to the sheer embarrassment of both Rachel and Ross.   Favourite Lines:  Ross:Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk with you about something I'm really uncomfortable talking about. Joey:Sure. How about, uh, you showering with your mom? Ross:I actually had a topic in mind.\n\nText 2:These come from The Mrs' brother in law and from my uncle. As such, they tend to focus on our families, so most aren't that great of us lot. However, here's a few of them.  The happy couple    'That was a piece of piss, wasn't it?'    Dan wanders into shot    Me and my sisters - Look at that bump!    'There's a fucking dwarf trying to stare me out!'    The attendants    Dan tells his joke about the Korean, the pet shop and the barbeque. I find it offensive while my new wife doesn't get it.    'What's that on my hand?'    'Look! It's still there!'    'Heh. I just shook hands with the photographer and now he's got it.'    The parents    'That fucking dwarf is back'    Me and my grandma    I'm really fucked off I forgot to wear my jacket for the cake photos.

It seems that people are often upset by something they are passionate about and can influence others to become passionate about it as well. I have some empathy, but I think that when it comes to ideas that don't really affect me, I can't really become passionate about it. I think I am an apathetic person living in an apethetic society.

The tragic loss of this extraordinary young man will seem a heavy blow to our nation's morale, as it is surely a grievous injury to his loved ones.   'Many American families have suffered the same terrible sacrifice that Pat's family must now bear, and the patriotism that their loved ones' exemplified is as fine and compelling as Pat's. But there is in Pat Tillman's example, in his unexpected choice of duty to his country over the riches and other comforts of celebrity, and in his humility, such an inspiration to all of us to reclaim the essential public-spiritedness of Americans that many of us, in low moments, had worried was no longer our common distinguishing trait.   'When Pat made his choice to leave the NFL and became an Army Ranger, he declined requests for interviews because he viewed his decision as no more patriotic than that of his less fortunate, less renowned countrymen who loved our country enough to volunteer to defend her in a time of peril. It is that first lesson of patriotism that we should reaffirm in our own lives as we celebrate the courageous life and mourn the heroic death of this most honorable American.'"], "gold_label": 0.0}

I was sitting here emailing Toledo Dave and I happened to glance out the window.  There were three deer just hanging out on the hill, eating grass and wagging their little tails.  I got all excited and called next door.  Sherri looked outside and said there was 8 of them out there!  I've seen deer before, but never just looked out the window and there they were.  It's a good thing we didn't have deer like this at home; my Dad would have constantly been shooting at the poor things.  Maybe Glenville isn't so bad after all...   I totally missed all of my classes today.  I woke up at 6:30AM and thought someone had shot me in the tummy. Suffice to say I wanted to die.  I felt like that up until 4:30PM when I finally drug my happy ass out of bed for some chicken broth.  That seemed to do the trick as I feel fine now.  Strange things bellies are...   OK, Sherri and I are going to do laundry.  Woohoo!\n\nText 2:Mikey the Cat, I am allergic to you.  You're cute, but no more cuddling.  Today I washed the GTI and my Mom's car.  The washer thing ate half of my money so there I was in the wash bay with no change to rinse my car.  He was all soapy, and I couldn't rinse him.  So I had to call my Mom and have her bring me change to finish washing my car.  Note to self, don't go to wash your car with only $2 in your pocket.  Dumbass.  The rust is a-popping out on the GTI.  I really have my work cut out for me this weekend if it's nice outside.  I detest sandpaper.  For some reason it just skeeves me out, and I hate sanding my car.  But it must be done, so I'll deal.  I kind of wish I hadn't washed him today as it just makes the rust spots more apparent.  I just downloaded the new SBC/Yahoo DSL browser.  It's even better than Netscape 7, but then again my Netscape browser has been fucking up for over 2 weeks so anything is better than that.  Oh well...  It was so warm out today.  At least 70 degrees and sunny.  I guess it's supposed to rain Monday and Tuesday, hopefully it'll be nice the rest of the week and the weekend.  Anyone know of where I can rent a Ferrari for the day or the weekend?  Dr. Dork graduates in May and his graduation present request is to have a Ferrari rented for the day or weekend.  I plan on passing this info on to his parents, and I'd like to know if this can even be done before I go to his Mom and Dad.  They were going to buy him a new laptop, so I know they're planning in spending at least $1500 to $2000 on his graduation gift.  Anywhere in Northeast Ohio is great, and I'm guessing Cleveland/Beachwood  is going to be my best bet.  Even Columbus or Pittsburgh is OK.

This ERIC Digest is in Spanish.  It is a translation of Leadership for School Culture.  From the ERIC Digest:  El campo de la educacion no tiene una definicion clara y consistente de cultura escolar. El termino se ha usado junto con una gran cantidad de conceptos, tales como 'clima', 'ethos', y 'saga' (Deal 1993). El concepto de cultura en educacion proviene del area corporativa, con la idea de que brindaria orientacion para un ambiente de aprendizaje mas eficiente y estable.  Los academicos han estadon discutiendo el significado de la palabra cultura por siglos. El destacado antropologo Clifford Geertz (1973) ha efectuado una gran contribucion a nuestra comprension actual del termino. Para Geertz la cultura representa 'un patron de significado transmitido historicamente'. Esos patrones de significado se expresan tanto (explicitamente) a traves de simbolos como implicitamente en nuestras creencias dadas por sentadas.   Una revision de la literatura sobre la cultura escolar nos dice mucho sobre la perspectiva de Geertz. Terrence E. Deal y Kent D. Peterson (1990) dicen que la definicion de cultura incluye 'profundos patrones de valores, creencias, y tradiciones que se han formadas a lo largo de la historia (de la escuela)'. Paul E. Heckman (1993) nos recuerda que la cultura de la escuela yace en 'las creencias compartidas por profesores, estudiantes y directores'. Estas definiciones van mas alla de la tarea de crear un ambiente de aprendizaje eficiente. Se enfocan mas en los valores medulares que son necesarios para ensenar e influir en las mentes jovenes."], "gold_label": 1.0}

A long time ago, before the world was created and humans set foot on it for the first time, virtues and vices floated around and were bored, not knowing what to do.   One day, all the vices and virtues were gathered together and were more bored than ever.   Suddenly, Ingenious came up with an idea: 'Let's play hide and seek!'  All of them liked the idea and immediately Madness shouted: 'I want to count, I want to count!'   And since nobody was crazy enough to want to seek Madness, all the others agreed.    Madness leaned against a tree and started to count: 'One, two, three...'    As Madness counted, the vices and virtues went hiding.  Tenderness hung itself on the horn of the moon,  Treason hid in a pile of garbage.  Fondness curled up between the clouds and Passion went to the centre of the earth.  Lie said that it would hide under a stone, but hid at the bottom of the lake, whilst Avarice entered a sack that he ended up breaking.    And Madness continued to count: '...seventy nine, eighty, eighty one...'    By this time, all the vices and virtues were already hidden - except Love.  For undecided as Love is, he could not decide where to hide. And this should not surprise us, because we all know how difficult it is to hide Love.    Madness: '...ninety five, ninety six, ninety seven...'  Just when Madness got to one hundred, Love jumped into a rose bush where he hid.    And Madness turned around and shouted: 'I'm coming, I'm coming!'  As Madness turned around, Laziness was the first to be found, because Laziness had no energy to hide.    Then he spotted Tenderness in the horn of the moon, Lie at the bottom of the lake and Passion at the centre of the earth.    One by one, Madness found them all - except Love.  Madness was getting desperate, unable to find Love.  Envious of Love, Envy whispered to Madness: 'You only need to find Love, and Love is hiding in the rose bush.'    Madness grabbed a wooden pitch fork and stabbed wildly at the rose bush.  Madness stabbed and stabbed until a heartbreaking cry made him stop.  Love appeared from the rose bush, covering his face with his hands.    Between his fingers ran two trickles of blood from his eyes. Madness, so anxious to find Love, had stabbed out Love's eyes with a pitch fork.    'What have I done! What have I done!' Madness shouted.  'I have left you blind! How can I repair it?'    And Love answered: 'You cannot repair my eyes. But if you want to do something for me, you can be my guide.'    And so it came about that from that day on, Love is blind and is always accompanied by Madness."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Sigh. I had thought that I was getting over it, but seeing her again brought back everything. How could I be so foolish in looking at the pictures? I knew that my friend knew her, but I braved clicking to see the pictures anyway... I think my heart still hasn't let go as much as I had thought and hoped it did. No wonder it still hurts at times. Maybe it would be wise for me to stay away from the Internet for a while.  It is a sad thing that I had brought things to that painful point of rejection, again. It is a sad thing that when I fall in love, I become a millstone cast into the sea. It is even a sadder thing when, in every single romantic endeavour in the past, all the seas have casted me out to dry in the harsh winds of the empty beach.  This time around, God decided to rub it in on me that I had it all wrong, and that hurt all the more.  All this over a bunch of females who themselves are fallible, imperfect beings. Why do I let myself get so caught up in pursuing them?  Why do I quickly forget the previous pain the last rejection brought me, and make the same stupid mistakes over again? More and more, it makes me feel like I'm not really romantically attractive. Am I just too odd?  It is it my super-deformable nose?  Is it my obsessive tendencies?  Or, simply, God just doesn't want me to find anyone yet, and for His own good reasons.  It's at these points of thought where I realize that I still have a long way to go in my walk with God. They reveal that I am still trying to find my peace, my fulfillment apart from knowing Him. I find myself having to go online, having to blog, having to do all these things in futile endeavor to be liked, admired, and thought of as 'influential' in others' lives. I am falling into that same old pattern of trying to find my fulfillment in the praise and favor of others. That's what it boils down to, I guess.  God, I am the lost sheep. I keep going to places on my own, trying to create things for myself, when You are the one that knows what's best. Oh, let this foolish heart see what that best way is!\n\nText 2:Lucy: 'Every day I wake up in Philadelphia it's a sacrifice because I hate being here.'  Yes.

That is partially my fault, but I really don't see what it is with my father.  I hate my family.  My mom is fully supportive of Forensics, but she hates to do anything.  She is always trying to get rides for me because she doesn't feel like it.  That is so embarrassing when I see all these other parents who don't mind to take their children places, but now it makes me feel bad when they are equally responsible for getting me places now.  And this has nothing to do with her surgery, I can understand that,  but this is all the time.  Then my dad.  He just does not understand and he won't take the time to listen.  Sometimes I just cry myself to sleep wishing he didn't pressure me so much.  I have so much to focus on at the moment and it all just adds up.  The reason I don't like to help around the house, isn't that I'm lazy, it's that I am so tired, stressed, frustated, angry, and just all around overwhelmed and all I want is some time by myself to cool off and simer before I join my corruptive family.  The reason I forget to call them is that deep down I don't want to call them.  I want to be out for as long as possible so that I can just be away from them.  And on Saturday when all my friends are out to eat, celebrating, I'll be at home with the worst people in my life right now.  I love them, but they are horrible people to be around, I guess that is why I have an 'attitude' as my dad calls it.

I just downloaded this song called 'Commandante Che Guevara' which is about...uh Che Guevara, and it's such a beautiful song, you know the reason why people are so political (well some) is because in the face of humanity our society and our political governments are such shit, they violate our basic laws and rights. The people of Latin America have been treated like animals for over 100 years and when they decided to uprise they were slaughtered, much like Orwell implies in 'Animal Farm'. I dunno...you are forced to a way of life and you don't have a say. It's so wrong...community spirit, without the bitching and the scandals...which are always funny...that's what I want you know? the ability to talk to people, I still remember one of my lecturers saying that I was living in a bonafide pipe dream and that idealism has no place in this world, because people are dangerous, because people suck. People are robots until you talk to them properly. Everyone has a story and something to say and not everyone is going to be a dangerous criminal, but the government/media like to install that fear into us, to make us accept and appreciate the police force...I have to go to Newtown and pay the rent, in my pocket there is going to be $930.00  Hmm....

Arthur became President when James Garfield was assassinated. Before being chosen as Vice President, he had been collector of customs for the port of New York .

I drank way too many margaritas, as well as some sort of red shot, lots of Newcastle, and zambooka.  Damn zambooka.  The night involved the above drinks, a sweet jukebox, an extremely friendly Irishman, a guy who looked like one of the singers in the Barenaked Ladies, and a computer programmer with a girlfriend (the one guy  I  decide to talk to all night, btw.  And, I don't remember his name.)  To make a long story short...I stumbled into my studio apartment at 1am, went into the bathroom, and puked.  And to remind you, my parents were sleeping over...so they heard and saw everything.  My mom played the sympathy ticket: 'Oh honey, I feel so sorry for you...'  While my dad was a smart ass as usual: 'Too much medicine, huh?  *laughs under breath*'  I mumbled something and got into bed...the next day, as death warmed over me, mom and dad got me up at 7am to go to mass.  Oh my Lord.  I've never felt more like ass...ever.  The one time I go out hard core in about  two years  and my parents spend the night.  Good grief."], "gold_label": 1.0}

It juz wasn't the kindda standard tt one would expect. The judges, the contestants, the atmosphere, basically everything juz wasn't up to my expectations.

Apparently, there are 3 levels of basic cable (wisely called 1, 2 and 3).  Im getting the first option.  Glen explained what channels are available for each option and when he mentioned Fox News (part of option #3, FYI), he editorialized that, if you like news, thats a really good channel.

Does anyone else use the term skull fuck as often and meaningfully as we do?  I doubt it. C, i'm pumped about you coming out to Cleveland. I've started counting down the days to christmas but it is tough since i don't know when you are coming for sure. On an awkward note: I saw C's ex this weekend and she was talking about wanting to come up sometime and she was going to bring Skittles Mike. I wanted to tell her that I'd probably rig the front porch with landmines if that were to happen but I restrained myself. Instead, I told her that I would have to tear off his nipples and feed them to the bums that ride the Train in the morning. not really, but i know a guy. So, you need to start making arrangements to come to the Pig Roast next year with me right now. I don't want these plans to fall through. For Aaron, the pig roast was over the weekend and some friends of mine from school and all their high school friends have this giant outdoor festival. This year there were 35 kegs, 11 different animals cooking at some point throughout the night and day, 250 people, and plenty of sex and substance abuse. Not to mention a pool and games called Cornhole. (figure that shit out) All of this takes place in the middle of nowhere in Logan Ohio at a Farm House that is abandoned the remaining 362 days of the year. Needless to say, I had a good time and I was only there for 1 night. Next year will be a marathon, i'm talking Boston Marathon. when I say that, I mean the time we got up at 8 and drank till 2:30 and then ate pizza till 4 and then I blew chunks some time before clint woke up which narrowly avoided Nate's wrath. I love it, i'm out.\n\nText 2:I cannot make this stuff up. The dumb girl that plays tennis I work with is unbelievable. Today, we started talking about how some of us hate to mow the lawn and others don't mind it. Jenny starts telling us that she will mow our lawns for us. We said, 'If you want to do it so bad why don't you just mow your own lawn?' Her reply, 'We don't cut our grass. But somehow it stays pretty short. I don't think we mow our lawn.' You can't make this up, why would you?  She has no idea how her grass has been mowed for the past 23 years. She's never seen her dad do it, she's never seen anyone else do it. She will admit that she has heard a lawnmower going outside of her house but can't confirm that it was someone mowing her lawn. As far as she knows, she lives on astroturf. (not that she knows what that is)  It was about this time that I fell in love with this girl. How can she be so dumb yet succeed in life? She's applying to transfer to the Georgetown Law School. No way in hell should a person like that be eligible for that school, yet she will probably be accepted. Unbelievable.  There was another thing that was completely insane that she said today.  Let me think what it was.  Oh yeah. We were walking back to work from lunch 2 days ago and we were outside at a different building downtown. We are about 3 blocks away and you could see the 21 story courthouse right in front of us. We walked a total of 5 minutes to another building. She looks up at the building we work in every day this summer, points, and asks, 'What building is that, that looks pretty cool.' True story. I think skull fucking is in her near future and C is the man to give it to her when he visits. I love it. So basically I have her phone number now and I have invited her to hang out with me while chief is gone. I can only imagine how good my evenings will be filled with her mindless rambling.

We went to the old Catholic cemetery in Clearfield around 8 pm.  First we fixed a few tombstones that had fallen over.  Unfortunately we couldn't fix them all, as some of them were too heavy to budge, even with four people lifting.At 9 pm the church bell rang.  We could barely hear it, because the races were too loud.  But we did hear it.  After it was done we gathered together and I gave a speech.  These are the exact words...       'To the Dead, now on this, the thirteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord two-thousand four, we gather here together to honor your lives, mourn your deaths, and patiently await your resurrection in Christ Jesus.  Amen.'  After the speech, we shone our flashlights on every tombstone we could see.  We tried not to miss any.  The dead even got a fireworks show last night, even though I'm not sure where the fireworks were coming from.  The amazing thing about the whole night was that it made us all feel like we had done something good, and big, something we couldn't understand.  Maybe something we didn't need to understand.  But I'll tell you one thing, that cemetery feels so alive.  It's strange.  I'm not sure what I believe about ghosts or spirits yet.  I can only turn to the Bible for answers, so that is where I will turn.  But if those spirits really were there, I bet they appreciated what we did for them.

Oh, wait, I know what hit me.  The news did a little segment on new-found footage of the WTC attacks.  All of it comes flooding back every time something like that comes on television.   It's almost two years, now, since that day.  It seems like a few months and a lifetime ago all at once.  How many times have you answered 'the question?'  You know which one I mean.  The one that is some form of 'where were you when life as we all knew it, changed.'     So, where was I?  I was in the hospital, two days removed from a knee replacement.  The nurse came in, woke me, and turned on the television just a few minutes after the second plane went in.  I called my best friend in Seattle and told her to get up and turn on the television.  While I was watching the footage, with my best friend on the other side of the country on the telephone, the second tower fell.   After that, we knew.  We knew nothing was ever going to be as it was.  After three sleepless days in front of that television (much to the chagrin of the doctor--he told me I needed to sleep), I finally turned the television off.  It was the same images over and over and over again and every time I watched those buildings fall, I felt sick.  To this day, when I see that footage, I get chills.   Once the nation started moving forward again, one thing brought tears to my eyes, over and over and over again.  The national anthem.  It was merely a song on September 10, 2001.  By September 12, 2001, it was something special.  It held a much deeper meaning to all of us.  To this day, it still sends some chills up my spine and puts a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye.   I don't know about you all, but I've been different since that day.  I can't get on a plane without wondering if I'll be on an ill-fated flight.  My priorities changed, too.  Before that day, I was all about being the best.  Making the most money, having the best job, having everything everybody else always wanted.  After that day, I wanted out of the responsibilities.  I didn't want to work at my high-paying job anymore.  I didn't need that much money.  I didn't need to deal with people that I didn't feel like I wanted to know.  I just didn't need what was going on in my life anymore.  A few months later, I quit my job.  Just walked out.  A day and a half later, I went apartment hunting back where I went to college and found the place I live now.  Two days after that, I called my old coach and begged to work for the team.  I made up with everyone that needed making up with and wrote off those that I didn't need to waste my time on anymore.  I just made clean breaks and went back to where I was happiest.   Do I regret any of that now?  Not one single thing.  I did what was right for me, and what I should have been doing all along.  And, to be honest, I think that's why I recovered so quickly from that knee replacement (and the variety of other surgeries and injuries I endured from the accident).  I was in a positive environment and I was happy.  It took a national tragedy for me to give me the push to make all those changes.  It shouldn't have had to take that, but it did.   I did lose someone that day.  I don't talk about him, because in my mind, it cheapens my memory of him.  But he was a very close and very dear friend of mine, who gave me much more than I ever deserved.  For that, and so much more, I will be forever grateful to him and his beautiful family.     What was my point of this whole entry?  Well, there really isn't one, but maybe you'll sit back and maybe you'll think about how things were before and how things are now and maybe you'll notice the change in you, too.  8:39 pm\n\nText 2:April 23   Nineteen years ago on that date, my sister passed away. This is the first year in the last seven that I've been home on that anniversary, and I commemorated it with a trip to her grave, where I placed nineteen lilies and five roses (a lily for every year she's been gone and a rose for every year she was alive).  I missed doing that the last few years.  I have done a make-shift version of it wherever I've been on that particular day on the anniversaries when I was unable to be here, but it's not the same.  I was sad to see that, while my family has assured me the opposite, none of them visit her grave on that day (or any other, from what I've seen).  My aunts assured me that on the anniversary of Lily's death, they'd make certain someone from every branch of the family tree would at least have flowers delivered to the grave site.  They lied, or they forgot, or they didn't care enough to tell me the truth, because I went to the site that night, and no one had been there.  Or if they had, they didn't leave any flowers or notes, or anything.  Maybe they've all just forgotten her.  I haven't, and never will.  Or maybe they're just doing something else to commemorate the day, but I really wish someone would clear that up for me.  Because, to me, it makes it look like they don't care.  Even if I know they do.    Sludge   Well, it's official now.  Half of my stuff that was stored on the floor in the basement is junk.  I said it would happen.  I pleaded with the parents to let me put another set of metal shelves down there to get my boxes off of the floor in the store room.  They turned me down.  And now half of my boxes, all of my rugs, the bottom dust ruffle on the sofa, and the desk are soggy because the sludge pump stopped working and sent sewer water throughout the basement.  Yes, for those of you curious, it did stink a bit, but luckily it happened while mom was doing laundry, so it was mostly laundry water.  At least the sofa has metal legs that keep it off the ground (they built 'em well back in 1952--the fabric didn't even absorb up from the ruffle), so that's pretty well in tact and safe.  The desk, on the other hand, was particle board with wood veneer (sp?) and is completely ruined.  The rugs are washable, and I hope after six or seven more washings, the smell will dissipate.  The stuff in the boxes, though, is junk now.  Boxes of books, notebooks, cooking utensils, and shoes.  I weep for the shoes.  Most of them were leather, and now are nasty looking, and therefore will be retired.  My grad plaques from the volleyball team and the track team were also in there and they're ruined.  I think my diploma was in there.  I know my cap and gown were, so I'm sure the diploma was near it.  A couple photo albums (including the entire wedding album for Ryan and Nikki--hopefully the other copy is safe and sound somewhere between those two families), and a box chock full of important papers should I ever be audited by the IRS.  So, yeah, I should have just stored them in the garage.  At least the garage doesn't have a sludge pump that might malfunction.    Gentle Cycle   So, that same day that the sludge pump went wonky, you'll recall that mom was doing laundry.  She threw not one, not two, but three of my shirts that go in the gentle cycle (but are supposed to be hand washed) in the regular cycle of the washing machine.  On hot.  And then she dried them.  Two of those shirts I'd only worn once, but the other was my absolute favorite shell tank.  It was a bargain basement purchase at TJ Maxx like three years ago, and I wore that shirt like once or twice every week, even in the winter (usually under a hoodie or under a jacket or under an oxford.  That shirt is now reduced to shreds and could maybe fit a second grader.  Eensie and unraveling.  Not cool.  I don't know why she tries to be helpful when it comes to my laundry.  She KNOWS that all it does is make me crazy mad.  I'm less than pleased with her right now.    Mr H   In much, much better news, Mr H will be home a week from tomorrow.  I won't see him that day, nor will I see him for the week after that, but two weeks from Sunday, he's coming up here to spend the remainder of the month, plus some, with me.  Once he gets here, he plans to stay in the extended stay hotel about a half hour south of here.  I couldn't be more excited, even if I won the lottery.  Good god I've missed him.  Some have asked about what I plan to do this summer, and at the moment, I have no idea.  First of all, I'm stoked to have summers off, and I can't for the life of me figure out why teachers bitch and moan about salary when they have a built in three months off, not to mention paid personal and sick days and full benefits.  I certainly will not.  Summer vacation rules, y'all.  Some of the plans I've tossed about include going wherever Mr H is going and keeping him company.  Picking up a managing gig with the local swimming pool.  Traveling the world (that's not happening).  Crashing on someone's couch in CF and partaking in all the summer debauchery that goes on around there.  Throw my ass into training and see if I can't snatch a spot on the Olympic team (not going to happen--I gave up my USA Track & Field membership, and all the random shit that goes along with it).  Seeing if I can't work my ass off somewhere and send myself and a group of my friends to Athens to watch the Olympics (where, if you read yesterday's entry, you should know is where I was supposed to be heading to get married--romantic thought, but I'm happy it didn't work out).  If you have some crazy suggestions for what to do with my summer, you should call or email me and let me know.  I'm up for almost anything, as long as I can afford it."], "gold_label": 1.0}

During Summerfest weekend, my little bro ended up on the Barcalounger in our hotel room on one drunken evening.

So all this Radiohead babble is getting a little exhausting.  DJS, I sold  Pablo Honey .  Deal with it.  I just have bad memories with that album and it was more of a cathartic thing than anything.  And like I care what some clown making minimum wage at Cheapo thinks?  Let's talk about something new...like Liz Phair's new masterpiece.  She sold out?  Who cares...her songs still (esp.

As y'all said about Radiohead, I much prefer to be surprised and entertained and enjoy an artist's changes over time.\n\nText 2:Clear Channel, the nation's largest chain of radio stations, made two significant announcements. In the first,  urlLink posted here , the San Antonio based company will limit the number of commercial time. In one market, advertising breaks were reduced from 16 to 12 minutes. However, the article does not mention whether this will include house advertisements. In other words, will the station reduce its clutter? Also, where will the reduction occur? During the morning and evening drive time? For all day parts?  In the second story,  urlLink posted here , Clear Channel will spend $100 million over 10 years to test the feasibility of digital radio. The technology promises to deliver stronger, clearer signals.  Neither article really mentions the force behind these actions. XM and Sirius have achieved enough subscriber mass for Clear Channel to perceive the two satellite operators as competitive threats. Although XM and Sirrius carry commercial stations, its competitive advantage comes from a commercial-free service with a sound quality perceived as superior to FM or AM stations.

It is not necessarily more serious than what I explained... I don't think. The last few days that we were able to spend together were just a whole lot of fun. And, we did spend a good amount of time around each other. No, it is not just the sex that was fun... but that was too. We just hung around and talked, walked around downtown, and shot a few games of pool. This was also after I decided to stop drinking, so there was no alcohol in me at these times. Elena was definitely shocked that I stopped and surprised that I could go into a bar and not drink. I will get back to the drinking thing here in a sec... I will tell you this though, I REALLY enjoy spending time with her. Am I thinking marriage... um... NO. I don't think that I can dedicate myself to someone that much anymore. The only person I can dedicate myself to is L, and that is for obvious reasons. Damn, I miss my little girl. But Elena is a kick ass chick who is fun to be with.  The drinking thing... I came to a realization that I can not control my drinking over here when I start. So what better way to control it than just not drink. This week has been hell on that account. It was hard to not down the bottle of 151 after packing up Elena's apartment.  So did I answer your question or just create more? Honestly, I just wish y'all would have the opportunity to meet her.

We're short staffed, somewhat: we need another violin or viola who can manage to read music as well as Jamey can.  (Kudos, Jamey: your cello playing is showing excellent progress.  It's obvious that you're not having to learn music as you learn technique.  Very impressive!)  Repertoire is, again, a potential roadblock.  I have some Haydn quartets, but not much else.  Personally, I'm not crazy about music with fewer than four parts.  Five is better, etc.  But it's better to play a duet than to miss a chance to play chamber music!  We need more music that calls for strings and  urlLink chic   urlLink flutes .  (Hi Jamie!)  Impromptu chamber music?  Call me!  My number is . . .\n\nText 2:My Mobile Phone...literally   I walked towards the tram yesterday, as the wind blew and the last hints of twilight shone in the sky. It was about 6.40pm, and I'd just spent a good 45 mins or so just chatting with Jessie after lecture, while she waited for Tammy to finish class. I had a nice time, just having coffee and talking about school - Jessie's so easy to talk to.   Anyway, since it was pretty close to dinner time, I figured I'd better give EG a call n let him know I was on my way back. I reached into my jacket pocket...and found it empty!  'Arrrgh! Where could it be?' I checked my bag, rummaged through it. As the pit of my stomach started to swirl, my brain kicked in. 'I probably left it in the lecture hall or something. Better go find the security guard who locked it.' So i ran to the station, hoping to somehow locate the guard. He was there! Manning the station! Angelo was his name, a guy in his late 20s-30s, and he was kind (and friendly) enough to call another guard to walk with me back to the theatre, which was right at the other end of campus.   So me and Keith, this tall man with a moustache, probably in his 40s, walked in the cold back towards the theatre. 'Where else do you think it could be?'  'I don't know. The Baillieu Library probably...'  'Have you checked it?'  'No, not yet. Probably later.'  We walked up the steps to the theatre. I walked in, and searched the area where I sat. No phone. He looked up and down the theatre steps too. No phone either.  'Sigh, it's ok, I'll check with the library. Thanks!' 'Yep.'  I walked back towards the library, where I'd gone with Jessie to zap lecture notes. I put on my jacket there, so I figured it must have slipped out then. I checked with the librarians and the lost-and-found counter there. No deal. I tried calling EG on the payphone, and Jon's house phone, but no one picked it up.  My heart dropped as I registered the fact I'd probably have to spend a few hundred bucks to get a new phone. Money that I found hard to part with. All this while, I was begging the Lord 'please, Lord, please...', yet was resigned to the fact it was probably gone. People adhere to the finders-keepers mentality over here - I lost my sunnies a month back, and never saw it again. Let alone a phone!  I walked in dark back to the cafe where I had coffee with Jessie. It was probably closed though - it was already 7 plus. The ground was damp, the air cold. I shivered as my toes gripped my Birkie sandals. A light! People were still there! I knocked on the glass door. 'We're closed!' said the girl on the inside. I knocked again. She gestured with her hands, that they were closed. 'Hey John, there's someone at the door knocking!' she said in a nasal voice. John looked up. 'I'm sorry, we're closed'  DUH, I knew that already.  'I'm sorry, but did you guys see a mobile phone in here?' I yelled through the glass door. 'What?' 'I said I think I left my phone in here!'  He opened the side door, and I explained myself. 'Sorry, we just cleaned up, and didn't see anything.' 'Oh, it's ok' 'I'll leave a note in the the cafe, in case I find anything, so you can check back tomorrow?' 'Thanks.'  I trudged on, towards the Student Union info desk, in the vain hope that someone might have picked it up. It was closed.   I scrounged through my bag again, then decided to return to the library to call someone. The only other number I had memorised was Charles', so I called him. 'Charles!' I squawked, 'I lost my phone!'  'Huh? How?' 'Don't know lah. Must have dropped it somewhere. Do you have Chris' number? I'm trying to call pple at home but no one's picking up!' 'Ok, hold on ah...'  He gave me the number, and I lamented how I'd have to buy a new phone. He offered to sell me his other phone, the one he had but wasn't using at the moment. I said see how, still praying that I might find it.  I tried calling my phone, in case the person who found it picked up. Or at least if it was switched off, at least I knew for sure it was gone and could move on. It rang. And rang...and rang. It was on vibrator mode though, so maybe whoever had it didn't hear it.  I retraced my steps again. No phone. I gave up.     tune in tomorrow to read the next episode of... My Mobile Phone...literally"], "gold_label": 0.0}

A person\u2019s time is their most valuable asset and yours is appreciated.  I want to talk to you about Fibromyalgia (FM) and Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS). Many have never heard of these conditions and for those who have, many are misinformed. And because of this judgments are made that may not be correct\u2026 So I ask you to keep an open mind as I try to explain who I am and how FM/MPS has assaulted not only my life but those whom I love as well.  You see, I suffer from a disease that you cannot see; a disease that there is no cure for and that keeps the medical community baffled at how to treat and battle this demon, who\u2019s attacks are relentless. My pain works silently, stealing my joy and replacing it with tears. On the outside we look alike you and I; you wont see my scars as you would a person who, say, had suffered a car accident. You wont see my pain in the way you would a person undergoing chemo for cancer; however, my pain is just as real and just as debilitating. And in many ways my pain may be more destructive because people can\u2019t see it and do not understand....  Please don\u2019t get angry at my seemingly lack of interest in doing things; I punish myself enough I assure you. My tears are shed many times when no one is around. My embarrassment is covered by a joke or laughter, but inside I want to die....  Most of my 'friends' are gone; even members of my own family have abandoned me. I have been accused of 'playing games' for another\u2019s sympathy. I have been called unreliable because I am forced to cancel plans I made at the last minute because the burning and pain in my legs or arms is so intense I cannot put my clothes on and I am left in my tears as I miss out on yet another activity I used to love and once participated in with enthusiasm.  I feel like a child at times... Just the other day I put the sour cream I bought at the store in the pantry, on the shelf, instead of in the refrigerator; by the time I noticed it, it had spoiled. When I talk to people, many times I lose my train of thought in mid sentence or forget the simplest word needed to explain or describe something. Please try to understand how it feels to have another go behind me in my home to make sure the stove is off after I cook an occasional meal. Please try to understand how it feels to 'lose' the laundry, only to find it in the stove instead of the dryer. As I try to maintain my dignity the Demon assaults me at every turn. Please try to understand\u2026.  Sleep, when I do get some, is restless and I wake often because of the pain the sheets have on my legs or because I twitch uncontrollably. I walk through many of my days in a daze with the Fibro-fog laughing at me as I stumble and grasp for clarity.  And just because I can do a thing one day, that doesn\u2019t mean I will be able to do the same thing the next day or next week. I may be able to take that walk after dinner on a warm July evening; the next day or even the in the next hour I may not be able to walk to the fridge to get a cold drink because my muscles have begun to cramp and lock up or spasm uncontrollably. And there are those who say 'but you did that yesterday!' 'What is your problem today?' The hurt I experience at those words scars me so deeply that I have let my family down again; and still they don\u2019t understand\u2026.  On a brighter side I want you to know that I still have my sense of humor. If you take the time to spend with me you will see that. I love to tell that joke to make another\u2019s face light up and smile at my wit. I love my kids and grandbabies and shine when they give me my hugs or ask me to fix their favorite toy. I am fun to be with if you will spend the time with me on my own playing field; is this too much to ask? I love you and want nothing more than to be a part of your life. And I have found that I can be a strong friend in many ways. Do you have a dream? I am your friend, your supporter and many times I will be the one to do the research for your latest project; many times I will be your biggest fan and the world will know how proud I am at your accomplishments and how honored I am to have you in my life.  So you see, you and I are not that much different. I too have hopes, dreams, goals\u2026 and this demon\u2026. Do you have an unseen demon that assaults you and no one else can see? Have you had to fight a fight that crushes you and brings you to your knees? I will be by your side, win or lose, I promise you that; I will be there in ways that I can. I will give all I can as I can, I promise you that. But I have to do this thing my way. Please understand that I am in such a fight myself and I know that I have little hope of a cure or effective treatments, at least right now. Please understand\u2026.  Thank you for spending your time with me today. I hope we can work through this thing, you and I. Please understand that I am just like you\u2026 Please understand\u2026.

I had a threesome of this yesterday, so I figured it earned a place in blog history.  First, I had a client call to ask about a local magazine that we recieve here at the hotel regularly for our guests.  It has Pamela Anderson on the cover of its 10th Anniversary Issue (January 03), and he knows someone in Kid Rock's band who can get Pamela to autograph it for him.  It was such a big deal for him that I promised to do my best and get my hands on two of them as he asked.   Turns out, all I had to do was walk down to our Housekeeping department and ASK.  We have tons of them.    So, off they went to my guest up north, and he's so very grateful and what can he do to repay me?  Well, he's a jewelry broker, so I'm sure we'll think of something.  *sparkle-sparkle*  Then, there was the request at daycare posted to the door upon entering.  Please bring in three empty film canisters and an empty tissue box.  Trash, that I would keep lying around just for such instances.  Actually, I just threw a tissue box away last Friday, and I left 3 film canisters at my mother-in-law's house over the weekend to get the film inside developed.  The children are making instruments - except for mine of course, because I threw all of that stuff away!  And then there was the binder I found tucked away on a shelf yesterday.  I use lots of binders at work -- lots of 'em.  I need a new 2 inch binder to replace an old 2 inch binder that has busted out of its 2 inches.  So, I went to remove one from a shelf that's been sitting there unnoticed for who know's how long.  I check with my office mates to make sure it's OK I take this particularly lovely 2 inch binder for my own.  All of a sudden, one of my colleagues decides that the information inside could be valuable to him, and please don't use THAT binder.  And as it turned out, he started using the info in that binder today and it has been very useful indeed.  Go figure.

This man, let us call him Space Cadet, as not to offend his paranoid Schizophrenic marijuana induced state by revealing his true identity.  So let's start....  The day begins, he comes to work, mumbling and cussing to himself. He sits in his cubicle and continues to ramble for 30 minutes amongst himself, going so far as asking questions and answering himself.  When he stops, he proceeds to spend the rest of the morning surfing e-Bay shopping for parts for his 9 cars that he owns.  YES, supposedly the Democrats are working class people...however, this guy owns 9 cars.  He then continues to work crossword puzzles and takes a nap in his cubicle while everyone else is working.  He does manage to do something constructive (using constructive loosely of course!)usually during the day, he will usually write a Letter to the Editor of the local newspaper, chastizing the President for spending money to Iraq and getting nothing in return, or demanding answers from the local congressman because they are asking for tax increases and he wants to know where the money is going. It's funny to me that he is concerned over how other people are spending their money but not how his employee is spending money to pay him for doing absolutely nothing.    He rants and raves the latter part of the day about how Bush is horrible and we need a Liberal in office.  Space Cadet claims that marijuana should be legalized because 'It never hurt anybody.' Yet from personal experience, I have seen numerous friends and family waste their lives living in oblivion and seeing that 'never hurt anybody pot habit' turn into a serious drug addiction.  Space Cadet also claims that abortion never hurt anybody either. That a baby isn't alive until it's born, however, when I ask him for proof he just spins it around until I stop asking.    He believes that the Government should support him and his family when he gets older, but he thinks that he shouldn't have to be responsible for anything that he does.  His ideas are always right, you are always wrong.  His canidate for office is always a champion and yours is always a fluke.  Space Cadet believes that you shouldn't own a gun, you don't have any reason to own one. He thinks that everyone runs around with the warm fuzzies all the time and that life would be perfect if we stopped manufacturing guns.  He believes that we should continue to leave the borders open on this country and not have a Department of Homeland Security. Because, 'really, what do we need these people for, they aren't hurting anyone'.  Quoted from the mouth of the oh so intelligent Space Cadet.  Well no, these people don't hurt anyone do they, they just blew up thousands of people in a building and hijacked planes full of innocent people and killed them.  No, they don't 'HURT' anybody do they.  Space Cadet believes that we shouldn't be fighting this war. He believes that we all should just hold hands and sing 'Kumbaya' and everything will be just peachy. He believes that the militaries budget should be cut along with defense spending.  Here in the real world, away from his drug induced, brain washed stupor, he needs to realize that SHIT DOES HAPPEN. How does he think that his children and himself got the freedom that we have in this country, it's not because of the likes of Katie Couric, Bill Clinton or himself.  It's because we took a fucking stand, we took care of business, faced the enemy and took charge.    If you have the problem of being a liberal, stop and think for a minute...... What if you had been aborted? What if we didn't have a military? What if drugs were made legal? What if nobody did their job and worked? What if your husband/wife died on September 11th? What if your life depended upon owning a gun? What if we all just sat back and watched the grass grow? What if you lived under tyranny and fear?

At a pre-frosh picnic 2 Sundays ago, I was giving advice to this high school senior about dealing with guilt and failure by learning how to preach the Gospel to oneself, and how to explore it in its objective truth.  Little did I know that I was about to plunge into another pit of guilt and of depression.  It's funny how whenever I give advice, I find it immediately being put to the test in my personal life... God, you sure keep your children accountable.  Now that I'm in the Rutgers program, I should feel a little more secure about my future, but I don't.  But, I know that I have to learn how to fight my emotions, to be more steeled in my will... it's shaming to admit that I'm a passive person, but what does the Gospel say?  Shall I fear my emotions? Shall I fear my faults in character?  Shall I fear condemnation? Or, shall I fear the God that forgives? the God that saves? the God that empowers? the God that loves?  Whom shall I fear?\n\nText 2:Ever since I was a young boy, I can remember running to food for comfort, boredom, protection, and the list goes on. I would sneak food into my room, eat extra at meals, everything that you can think of, I have done it.  One particular instance I remember was when I was going to a Boy Scout meeting on my bike. My church was about 1/2 mile south of a Taco Bell, so I rode my bike up to buy 2 Chilitos (or a chili-cheese burrito) and 2 orders of nachos. I would have been between 10 and 12 at the time.  I must have left early and stolen some money from my Mom's purse. When I got there, I was standing in line at the counter when I heard my name frm the kitchen...at least I thought it was from the kitchen. It turned out that my Mom had decided to by Taco Bell for my family's dinner and I had been caught red-handed. I don't remember what happened to me that day, but I am sure that it wasn't pretty.  Honestly, I do not remember a whole lot about my childhood. I remember names and faces of friends, family get togethers, some Halloweens, and a couple isolated incidents, but, in general, I believe that I have suppressed most of my memories of my childhood on Bryn Mawr Dr.  I believe the reason for this is that I had so many bad times. Don't get me wrong; I was born into a wonderful, supportive family that loved me very much, but I was F A T! Both of my parents were a little haevy, so it was not a surprise, I guess.  I remember eating chips in my room, hiding Doritos in my closet, and even asking kids at school for thier extra food. But, most of all, what I really remember is that feeling that you don't have any friends. I would hang out with people, but I never felt like anybody's friend.  When high school started, is was pretty much the same deal, with the exception that I ate MORE!  I was mobile and had a job.  That meant lots of fast food.  Sometimes $10 in one day.  After I met my wife, Amy, and she discovered my eating disorder, she helped me get to somewhere that I thought would help.  It was called Acoria and it was supposed to help binge eaters.  Well, it didn't help me.  At one point, I weighed in at 365 pounds.  As I continued to struggle, Amy gained a good amount of weight also and pretty soon I was a size 54 pants and Amy was a size 14/16 dress.  That needed to change.  3 years ago we joined Weight Watchers after I had a particularly bad day at work.  We went that night and weighed in.  By last Christmas, Amy had lost 40 pounds and kept it off and I had lost 80 pounds and was livin' it up on my way to 230 pounds.   But, life had other plans.  As my profile says, I used to be a high school band director.  Let me say that as much as I do miss the kids, I do not miss that job 1 little iota.  It was torture.  As I struggled at work, the stress caused me to struggle with my weight and by just one week ago, I had gained back 25 pounds.  For the past 2 weeks, I have reaffirmed my goals and have worked hard to achieve them.  Why food?  Why, when I was a child, did I run to the refridgerator for comfort.  THe answer is I don't really know why I started.  Through therapy, I have discovered that the reason that I still struggle is that this 'devious' side of me continues to battle for control.  I used to try to supress it, but now I know that I need to have a dialogue with it to make sure that it understands that I have the same goal in mind that it does and that I want to ge there a different way.  So, that is the Reader's Digest version of my food story.  Stay tuned tonight for the weigh-in results."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Maybe the most ongoing disappointment of my life (and don't worry I'm not disappearing into a funk -- I got a good sleep and plenty of caffiene today) is the fact that my dearest friends and the people that most inspire me / love me / enrich me.  Are mostly far away from me.  Globalization! [andrew spits].   [andrew regrets using such a visceral gesture since it translated so thin-ly onscreen and made such a mess on his already disgusting office carpet.]  When my friend Kelly went out to LA to study \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I set up a blog for her to tell us about her experiences in LA without feeling like she was writing rambling descriptions and depositing them in our inbox unsolicited.    i thought it worked out beautifully.    i read her exploits religiously -- but whenever i wanted.  sometimes i responded; mostly I didn't.    the blog seemed as redemptive a technology for the negative massification effects of web technology as was the voicemail / answering machine to redeem the telephone (connection over intrusion in both cases)  Martin Buber writes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all real living is meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd  - if the blog lets us MEET, then isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it a life-giving force?    Since this is sorta a 'metablog' anyway -- I do have to admit that one of the rich discoveries of this year's vacation was that the notion of BACK BURNER is an important one to keep me whole.  I journaled a whole entry (in my private journal, Lynn, just to reassure that even people 'like that' (like me) who want to 'write in journals and then publish them on the web!') on what exactly a back - burner is, what ends it might serve, and how it may (or may not) move forward onto front-er burners...  But that'll have to be on another back burner!  My heart is with Mary right now who, as far as I know, is IN LABOR having a *baby*!  Tell me that's not crazy.  To have the disembodied knowledge that one of your dearest friends is BEARING A LIFE right now...  I started filling in random links over there on the right.  But these have no referents nor categorization, but should at least enlighten and entertain...!  Peace~\n\nText 2:- feeling good - but only for a moment -    just read over some blogs after getting an email from a friend who just read -- wondering what he encountered... and realized that i felt the same way this morning as I did on  urlLink July 23rd .  Anyone have a sign / astrology / a portent / anything that can explain this continuity.  What makes people feel good?   for me? this morning?  a great intimate / kind email from a good friend.  the crisp cold of autumn and the fierce blue of the sky.  class held downtown at  urlLink muggswigz.   But then I had to be an *advocate* for openness and dialogue in faculty senate.  I love the people in faculty senate -- but it, like any senate, reflects the complexity of living in institutions.  Not my favorite feature of human existence right now... (in case you *haven't* read any of the last hundred blogs! Thanks for the affirmation, Marcaus, on these feelings....it meant a lot to have a simpatico spirit so far away)  And now I don't feel the smile of the universe anymore.    Hopefully my kids -- who I'm about to spend an hour with -- will show me the joy of being alive....  Peace~  But"], "gold_label": 1.0}

My mother is in the last stages of turning 'my room' into a guest room that only sparsly resembles me in any way shape or form. I think I'm ok with that. I no longer think of that house as 'home'. It's a place I've lived in... there's been many of those in the last four years.  So yeah, we stripped wallpaper, painted walls and ceilings. Hung out with Michele, watched movies with Geoff. Helped Janeth with the High School Art Show, had lunch with Isbell. Drove to down to 'da 'Nati' to pick up Nate and his friend Jess to go see the first showing of 'The Matrix Reloaded' (appropriatly dressed in black pleather, of course)...way cool movie btw...I think I need a second viewing though.

(Single's Awareness Day)  Well, I arrived in Florida expecting to get a tan, feel warm, have the sun shine on my face, and all that lovely shit......but to my surprise..its going to be crappy all weekend! WOO HOO!  The fact that snow doesn't get into my shoes is quite comforting but I am seriously in the middle of nowhere.... surrounded by old people that apprently like to invest in tacky lawn ornaments.  The highlight of my day yesterday was eating alligator (which, according to legend, DOES taste like chicken), and shopping at a Bell's Outlet (a cheap store where the people here like to invest thier social security).   Today was an improvement...I got to swim with manatees! You can go on a boat tour and go scuba diving off of it. I saw tons of the 'sea cows' and even got to pet one. It felt like leather. They like it when you scratch their backs...who doesn't?...so I happily obliged.  Oh! And get this....they have a 'Monkey Island' in the middle of the river. Its this small island where people stuck like 5 monkeys and put some ropes and shelters for them on it. The monkeys are scared of water and can't swim, so they can never get off.   How depressing is that?   My grandpa assured me (after I brought this to everyones attention) that the monkeys get fed 3 meals a day and are 'much better off' than in the wild.   Still.....I wouldn't liked to be held on an island and be turned into a tourist trap.  Ah well...maybe if it was sunny here I wouldn't be so bummed out.

I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.

What strikes me about the whole 'in his own image' issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God....  3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. 'But what about the separation of church and state,' you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent 'Under God' Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm.  6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights.   P.S. Need everyone's help: I can't decide between 'What's He Got?' by The Producers and 'Talk To Ya Later' by The Tubes as an example the pinnacle of the New Wave sound.

We're still gathering information, so take none of this as firm word, but what seems to have happened, happened quickly.  He woke up, got up out of bed...and went down.  The paramedics who showed up suggested it was either an aneurysm or a massive stroke.  His family members have been informed, and all of the the cast have, as far as we can determine, also been informed.    This is a terrible loss for all of us.  Richard was a consummate professional but more than that he was an honorable, stand-up guy.  If he gave you his word on something, you never had to wonder about it afterward.  He was always helpful and supportive of all the cast, even those who only came in for one episode, always with a ready smile and determined to do whatever it took to make the scene work.  He was, quite simply, a terrific guy, and everyone here is just devastated at the news.  More word as this develops.

While I did enjoy some leisure time with the kick ass nephew, it was mostly all work, little play, and a few stolen moments to work on some music.   One of my goals in LA was to nail down the audio portion of MOG-X. This required a ton of effort and attention, but thanks to a certain engineer making my life incredibly easy, I made leaps and bounds with it. This has been a good time, a fun experience, with few cringe worthy moments. The truth will be revealed as to what this all means in May. However when in LA, my mouth got the better of me in certain circles just to gague a reaction to this kind of project. Needless to say it went over well.  My priority however was my HF2 vocals. This means driving around all day and night through LA while blasting the demos in the car. I sing along to the scratch vocals in order to get more comfortable with the material so when we go back to record the final vox, the delivery will be more confident. I find this method works best for me. Also, I refuse to do final vocals until we have the drums tracked, so Brandt made it a priority to send me demos that had both scratch vocals AND live drums tracked. The feel, the dynamic totally changes. Anyway, I feel good about the melodies and lyrics and think I can kick some vocal ass when it's time to do the final vox.  Speaking of live drums, the HF crew had a field day in my absence and had several drum sessions. It seems, and I'm sure that someone will correct me if I'm wrong, the practice sessions recorded on to tape were very helpful to Robin. I can tell you that though I havent been there for the recording of these drums, what is being sent back to me is nothing short of amazing. It seems Ash and Brandt have achieved a great drum sound and well, I don't have to get into how awesome a drummer my girl Robin is. We're almost there!  On my last day in LA, I spent an evening at the home studio of Leo V23 to go through the track he is working on for us, OUR FAITH. It was mostly dissecting the song and getting into mechanics of it, but I did give him Carte Blanche to get all Cerati on this track. I have a good feeling about this.  Meanwhile it seems now that everything is about catching up with the real world. Not a bad thing. The Oscars are tonight and it shocks me that MASTER AND COMMANDER is nominated. I just watched it and jesus was it boring as hell. Awesome acting, great action, but terrible storytelling. A major disappointment.

Healer present a seemingly tranquil, and noticiably pleasant face to the world, and though to all appearances they might seem reserved, and even shy, on the inside they are anything but reserved, having a capacity for caring not always found in other types. They care deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite cause, and their fervent aim is to bring peace and integrity to their loved ones and the world.   Healers have a profound sense of idealism derived from a strong personal morality, and they conceive of the world as an ethical, honorable place. Indeed, to understand Healers, we must understand their idealism as almost boundless and selfless, inspiring them to make extraordinary sacrifices for someone or something they believe in. The Healer is the Prince or Princess of fairytale, the King's Champion or Defender of the Faith, like Sir Galahad or Joan of Arc. Healers are found in only 1 percent of the general population, although, at times, their idealism leaves them feeling even more isolated from the rest of humanity.    Healers seek unity in their lives, unity of body and mind, emotions and intellect, perhaps because they are likely to have a sense of inner division threaded through their lives, which comes from their often unhappy childhood. Healers live a fantasy-filled childhood, which, unfortunately, is discouraged or even punished by many parents. In a practical-minded family, required by their parents to be sociable and industrious in concrete ways, and also given down-to-earth siblings who conform to these parental expectations, Healers come to see themselves as ugly ducklings. Other types usually shrug off parental expectations that do not fit them, but not the Healers. Wishing to please their parents and siblings, but not knowing quite how to do it, they try to hide their differences, believing they are bad to be so fanciful, so unlike their more solid brothers and sisters. They wonder, some of them for the rest of their lives, whether they are OK. They are quite OK, just different from the rest of their family-swans reared in a family of ducks. Even so, to realize and really believe this is not easy for them. Deeply committed to the positive and the good, yet taught to believe there is evil in them, Healers can come to develop a certain fascination with the problem of good and evil, sacred and profane. Healers are drawn toward purity, but can become engrossed with the profane, continuously on the lookout for the wickedness that lurks within them. Then, when Healers believe thay have yielded to an impure temptation, they may be given to acts of self-sacrifice in atonement. Others seldom detect this inner turmoil, however, for the struggle between good and evil is within the Healer, who does not feel compelled to make the issue public.   http://typelogic.com/infp.html  INFPs live primarily in a rich inner world of introverted Feeling. Being inward-turning, the natural attraction is away from world and toward essence and ideal. This introversion of dominant Feeling, receiving its data from extraverted intuition, must be the source of the quixotic nature of these usually gentle beings. Feeling is caught in the approach- avoidance bind between concern both for people and for All Creatures Great and Small, and a psycho-magnetic repulsion from the same. The 'object,' be it homo sapiens or a mere representation of an organism, is valued only to the degree that the object contains some measure of the inner Essence or greater Good. Doing a good deed, for example, may provide intrinsic satisfaction which is only secondary to the greater good of striking a blow against Man's Inhumanity to Mankind.   Extraverted intuition faces outward, greeting the world on behalf of Feeling. What the observer usually sees is creativity with implied good will. Intuition spawns this type's philosophical bent and strengthens pattern perception. It combines as auxiliary with introverted Feeling and gives rise to unusual skill in both character development and fluency with language--a sound basis for the development of literary facility. If INTPs aspire to word mechanics, INFPs would be verbal artists.   Sensing is introverted and often invisible. This stealth function in the third position gives INFPs a natural inclination toward absent- mindedness and other-worldliness, however, Feeling's strong people awareness provides a balancing, mitigating effect. This introverted Sensing is somewhat categorical, a subdued version of SJ sensing. In the third position, however, it is easily overridden by the stronger functions.   The INFP may turn to inferior extraverted Thinking for help in focusing on externals and for closure. INFPs can even masquerade in their ESTJ business suit, but not without expending considerable energy. The inferior, problematic nature of Extraverted Thinking is its lack of context and proportion. Single impersonal facts may loom large or attain higher priority than more salient principles which are all but overlooked.

'I could talk about the content of the book and anything that happened up to  the end of the initial operation to (take) Baghdad, and nothing else,' he says.  'That was the condition for publication of the book and I agreed to that.'   Some in the army leadership might have preferred that his book had never been  published.

Sanzo's views are correct.  *takes particularly long swig*  Kuronue:  Oi!  Save some for me!  Buddha:  Sorry.  Kuronue:  S'okay.  Buddha:  But who knew that the highest priest of Buddhism was blasphemous?  And who knew a god would say that?  Kuronue:  Don't feel bad.  Buddhism is on a comeback.  Me, personally, enjoy being an atheist.  Baka:  *enters right*  Buddha, what are you doing?  Buddha and Kuronue:  Aw shaddup!  Baka:  I'm so glad I'm a Christian.  Kuronue:  Now, you're a Christian, yet you're sitting here talking to a god of a completely different religion.  Buddha:  Depends on your beliefs.  You see, she knows that I was more of an extreme follower of Allah.  I'm not really a god, but I ascended to a god-like level.  Baka:  This should be a sitcom.  Kuronue:  Hey, other people, come join the party.  Baka:  I'm out.  Kuronue:  Good riddance.  Baka:  Why I outta...  Kuronue:  Outta what?  Buddha:  Will the two of you be quiet?  Don't start fighting now.  Baka, go grab a drink for yourself and have a seat.  Kuronue:  Bring some food, too.  Baka:  Like I would bring you food.  Buddha:  Someone else can bring the food.

I'm pissed that I missed the hastily-arranged Country Bar Meltdown on Saturday.  I was sick as a dog on Friday.  Literally, I was sitting at my desk and felt like I was stoned (not that I have any idea what that's like) with my mouth hanging open and staring at the computer like I was some kind of a-hole.  It got so bad, that I told CK2 that I needed to go off and up out of the place and kill time until DJ LZ (my girlfriend) was ready to head back to the burbs.  So...what'd I do?  'There's a place for fun in your life...'  Mall of America, yo.  I went in, walking like a zombie and purchased a doughnut ala Krispy Kriz-eme and enjoyed a mouth-watering bottle of milk.  From there, I promptly headed to the video game store and played a demo version of Star Wars: The Clone Wars on Gamecube.  I got to fly a ship and kick some ass, but when my guy popped out of the ship and flipped on his lightsaber, the game took a turn for the worst.  It was some bad actor trying to do Mace Windu (Sam Jackson's character) and it stunk.  That, and a bunch of guys hit me with the killing.  Good time-waster, shitty game.  So, in a nutshell, I was too sick later that night for karaoke and such.  But I'm there next time.  P.S. Don't believe the Cocks.  8 Mile was a good flick.\n\nText 2:HAL has that glow about her...

With all the things going on in our political system at the moment, the celebration sort of slipped under most people's radar, but I did catch the last few speeches of a special debate when I got home from classes. One of the things I was reminded of was the fact that New Zealand was the first country in the world to give the vote to women, all the way back in 1893. We may have just a small country, but sometimes we are able to show the rest of the world how to do things.  Having said that, I am extremely glad that our politicians have reversed their attempt to make consensual sex legal for children as young as 12 years old. While I could see the reasoning behind the proposed change, I certainly could not agree with it. The argument that changing the law is not condoning it is farcical. The very act of changing the law condones it.  Our esteemed Prime Minister, in her usual way, is saying that it was never really an option, at least not in the way it was reported. Or is it possibly a back down (again) by a government still lagging behind the opposition in opinion polls? A cynical attitude perhaps, but on past experience... Whatever the reasoning behind the change, I am glad that it has turned out this way. If sex between children that young is happening, then education about the risks involved needs to be the priority, not simply letting it happen.  College is keeping me extremely busy, and is the reason why posts are few and far between at the moment.

According to these groups, smoking in the movies encourages kids to smoke; 52% of new smoking among adolescents is due to smoking in the movies, and that children who see large amounts of smoking in movies are three times more likely to smoke than kids who see movies with little smoking.  Ok, so there you have it.  Ive briefly read over their evidence and proposals.  It all seems to be thin at times, vague at others.  51 movies were selected for the 'Rated R' list because they featured popular arts among adolescents who were smoking. How were these stars selected? Its always dangerous for adults to think they know what, or who, adolescents like.  I don't necessarily agree with their methods or conclusions, but that's not my point.   Let me note another side of their campiagn...this one is the kicker.  This week, the FDA issued notice that  obesity  is quickly becoming the #1 preventable killer in the USA.  It already outranks  alchohol abuse  and  drug abuse , and at current rates of growth, will out-shine  tobacco use  in a few short years.  The anti-tobacco groups have listed in their perposed bill that all leading causes of death should warrent an R rating.  To include obesity.  That being said, let's suppose these people are right, and smoking in the movies does in fact increase the likelihood of an adolescent eventually smoking, and this fact alone should merit an R rating (usually reserved for sexuality, language and violence).  Fine. Great in fact, I'm not saying it  shouldn't  be a factor.  But let's take every other serious health danger and imagine the world they're asking for...alchohol in the movie? R rating.  Subject matter of suicide? R rating.  Fast Food, candy, potato chips?  Are these all causes of an R rating?  Of course not.  Does an over-weight actor have to fear not being casted because they might inspire some teenager to eat themselves into obesity  Ridiculous isn't it?  If the bill is accepted by the national ratings committee, here is a SHORT list of movies that will garner an R rating:   101 Dalmations Alice in Wonderland An American Tail The Great Mouse Detective Peter Pan Pirates of the Caribbean Snow Dogs Bed Knobs and Broomsticks Gone With The Wind Frosty the Snowman 102 Dalmations Inspector Gadget Galaxy Quest  The list goes on and on and on...

Well I'm still standing by my comments of yesterday, I just wanted to add a few things in response to people's comments. Although I agree to some extent with what Max said, there was still a fair amount of child abuse going on, it just wasn't 'done' to publicise it. For example Myra Hindley, the Moors Murders, the West murders, the kid who was abused and then hung from a tree in Reigate..... there were numerous notorious child abusers/murders. I think it can't have been so easy to get guns 20 or 30 years ago, I think a lot of the guns nowadays are imported cheaply and illegally from America. Hence tighter import checks and better security, and higher penalties for being caught. I don't like the idea of air marshals. Ok, perhaps it may stop loonies from trying to hijack a flight, but why sholud they get them just on trans-atlantic flights? I would have thought that there would be a much higher risk coming from flights from the middle east to Britain and from the middle east to the USA. Without being rascist (although it's going to sound it), most of the terrorists are 'freedom fighters' etc from Muslim and Arab countries. I understand that you can't put air marshals on their flights because they are Arab airlines (not British and American ones), but I really do not think it is anything to do with flights from Britain. What I want to know is,  who is paying for these air marshals- us, the British tax-payers; or the Americans, who are the ones who are so up-tight about it anyway?  I woudl lay my money on it being us who has to fork out for it. But there we go again, me getting back to how Blair has become Bush's lap-dog. Absolutley disgusting that one man can just do what he wants at will with a country.  My final moan for the day on the point of guns. It's not directly related, but I think it needs to be said.  I personally believe that capital punishment should be brought back. People like Ian Huntley do not deserve to live. Ok, God said 'Thou shalt not kill', but surely that works both ways- we shouldn't kill him, but he sholudn't have killed in the first place? But look back to the old testament- 'An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth'- surely this suggests that he should get what's coming to him? More and more British citizens are being imprisoned, and half the time they aren't even British citizens! This pushes up the price of keeping prisoners all the time, and like all the other good things in life, the money spent on the prisons by the good old British governemtn has to come from the tax payers. It would be a darn site cheaper to execute them. No mess, no hassle, no money, no protests about them being allowed to go on hunger strike, not giving them the safety of being locked up so they can't be mobbed for their heinous crimes, not giving them the chance to take their own lives and become 'martyrs' for other criminals of their types. Numerous states in America still use capital punishment, so why can't we? I believe that would be the answer. We should become a more agressive state in our policing policies- more police, more security for them, more severe punishment. Not just 'life sentences' that turn into 10 years behind bars because the culprit has 'reformed' or is let out on 'good behaviour'. If they're sick enough to commit a crime in the first place, then that violent/sadistic/homicidal/perverted/abusive tendancy is always going to be there.  Think that's all i wanted to have a moan about.\n\nText 2:I saw a bumper sticker today: 'I'm Proud To Be An American.'

So I guess I'm back!   well, a lot of things happened this few weeks that I was away from my blog, so much that I dun really know where to start blogging about. First up, to everyone who have been messaging me but not receiving a reply, I'm really sorry guys, my phoneline got cut. Guess my dad failed to pay his part of the bill again...Well, wad to do? Anyway, where did I stop the last time? The Singapore idol part rite? Yeah, I think so. Well, lets see...I finally got in touch with this primary school friend of mine after a really long time. She's currently in India, waiting to do her A' levels. Her birthday's on the 4th of July(I almost forgot about that..) and yeah, I received her email last night and I managed to pull my fingers to work and typed her a pretty long mail updating her on my current happenings for the past 3 months?? hahaha...Not an easy task I tell you... I haven't seen mum in a week already and I miss him so badly but no matter how bad I know its probably never gonna be as bad as how much wendy's missing kailun.     I HATE tHAT GUY!!!    he went to cathay when Wendy was working with this dumb bitch lor and I guess it really got on wendy's nerves. She broke down and called me(I was sleeping at that moment...)and started sobbing. I mean, fuck him la! I really didn't have a bloody clue as in to what she wants me to do lor. He's a fucking asshole and she knows that, we(kel and I) warned her about him and giving him another chance again but she didn't quite register our words and now this. What do you want me to do? No, put it this way, what the fucking hell can I do? I wanna kick his ass lor but I'm not there and he's probably not worth the effort. Who would be happy to hear something like that happen? Especially when you've already predicted the ending but no one gave a damn about it. So fine, I let you go ahead and do what you think is right and best for you. Hey, its your life man! I'm in no control of it, I dun want to be. So yeah, I let her go do what she wants and when she got hurt she came back to me, I didn't mind that part seriously, I dun mind that at all. She's almost like a sister to me, I'll die for her if I had to but what can I do? I'm at home, she's at work, crying for some asshole that nobody really likes. Worse still, why is she crying? cause'he went to the movies with a pretty girl. Well, told you it was gonna happen. Been there, done that. Then what happen, she said she tink she called the wrong person, I got admit, I didn't sound like I cared but you know what? You needed to talk so I let you, what am I to do? I can feel this thing boiling inside of me, if I actually spoke more than what I did that day I'd probably end up scolding her and when I say scold I really mean it. Its probably gonna make her feel 10x worse lor, so why bother? Lets just say I'm not exactly the best kinda friend you'd wanna have lo. In fact, I think I'm a lousy person altogether. I believe in letting people do what they wanna do and hopefully they'll learn their lesson from there.    give a man a fish, it'll feed him for a day.  teach a man to fish, it'll feed him a lifetime.   so yeah, that's what I did but more than often I get blamed for allowing things to happen although I knew it was gonna happen. I get blamed for leaving people in the lurch and not being the sympathic friend. Well, guess what? Its ok, I'm used to it! Blame me for all the fucking problems you have, for not being understanding, for not knowing sympathy etc etc etc...I'm used to it. I'm fine with it. I live my whole darn fucking life for others. I've lived my whole life trying to be what others want me to be but know what? I never quite make the cut. I love my friends, I'd make myself look bad if it makes them look or feel good but you know what? Its still not quite good enough. I dunno what else to do...or maybe I should just stop doing anything, I should just stop trying, I know its definitely gonna make my life a lot easier..."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I broke down and ordered the book yesterday (that's what I was doing over at Amazon when I got all into the wish list thing), so I'll finally have a clue what I'm supposed to be doing in the long haul.  I did find out I can substitute the oatmeal with whole-grain cereal, so that at least is a good thing.  Oatmeal's great, but how much of it can you eat if you don't like it to begin with?  So I spent some time in contemplation today in the cereal aisle and came up with some Kashi cereal that has like 9 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber (and 1 gram of fat) per serving.  So maybe I can switch off day to day.  I bought myself some spinach salad too, so that will be a little bit of a change from the ordinary as well.  To make my life easier I decided that rather than deal with ALL of the weight I want to lose at once, I'm going to break it down into manageable pieces.  So for the time being, my weight-loss goal is 20 lbs, and I have 15.5 to go to meet that goal (as of today). I think I can do that.  Once I get to that goal, it'll be time for a reward.  I think what I'm going to do is hold off on that second piercing until then, and use it for a reward, and then I can re-evaluate and reset my goals again.  And just go on from there.  Seriously, I don't think it's good for me mentally to do it any other way.  It's like when you have to work four in a row-you can't think about it that way.  You have to concentrate on just twelve hours at a time, otherwise you'll be totally depressed the whole time.  Or when you give up drinking (something else I also have personal experience with), everyone knows that in AA you do it one day at a time.  Or one hour, or one minute if necessary.  You can't think about it in terms of a lifetime, or the enormity of it will kill you.  Probably the most difficult thing is exercising.  I just don't like it.  Who does?  Oh yes, I'm sure there are some freaks out there who just can't wait to go burn calories, but let's face it, folks, I'm basically a turtle.  So I will do whatever little I can every day on the stepper, whatever little bit that amounts to be, and call it good.  Eventually I'm sure the little bit will be a bigger bit.  I'm not going to get myself all fanatical about it and I refuse to beat myself up over it.  Realistically, I'm looking at a year to do what I want to do.  Optimistically, nine months.  Either way, it's all good.  I've known some folks who have had that gastric bypass operation, some with really good results and some with really catastrophic results.  For a while I was interested in having it done, but insurance companies don't like to pay for it, it costs a lot of money, and the thought of going forever without a diet Coke was kind of an ultimate sacrifice to me.  Did you know that once you have that operation you can never have carbonated drinks again?  Anyway, it really is a dangerous procedure, but the results can be stellar.  I'll be honest and admit I was jealous watching people lose 90-110 lbs after having it done.  On the other hand, there's a lot of things they can't do henceforth, and I don't know that I'd want to deal with that.  So either way, here I am, and not getting any bypass done, but trying myself to handle this problem.  I've been dealing with it literally my whole life, and I'm really hoping that this will be the answer this time.  I was getting myself into that mindset of 'when I've lost all this weight, I'm going to..' and I don't even want to go that far yet.. I just want to deal with this rationally, realistically, and consistently, until I get to where I need to be.  And my ultimate goal is a realistic one (I admit I also have a secret goal that is absolutely unrealistic, too), so hopefully everything will work out for the best.  All encouragement, motivational comments and etc. are appreciated.  Leave me a good word, will you?!   urlLink"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were 'six months away from developing a weapon.' And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy 'for a long period of time.'  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  'Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them,' Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, 'what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right.'  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was 'imprecise,' said it stands by his words. 'The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts,' Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. 'We reject any allegation to the contrary.'  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. 'There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place,' is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for 'hard evidence' to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently 'extrapolated' the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. 'The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' ' he said in Michigan last week. 'And that could take a long period of time.'  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it 'does not object' to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: 'I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need.'  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: 'Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.' The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush 'was imprecise on this' and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited 'one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year.' He asserted that 'we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet' of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them 'targeting the United States.'  Bush also stated that in 1998, 'information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.' He added, 'Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists,' an alliance that 'could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.'   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an 'experiment' and 'attempt' and labeled it a 'serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region' -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack 'on any given day' with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as 'low' that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the 'extreme step' of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was 'unrealistic' to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that 'because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away.' There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made 'the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time.'   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was 'nothing uncommon' and decried the 'explosively larger education bill.'    2002 The Washington Post Company\n\nText 2:That's interesting Johnathan.  In regards to music I have an eclectic taste.  I like the rock music of the 70's and 80's since they represent a much simpler and generally more enjoyable time of my life (nostalgia).  I can't stand most of today's music, partly based on lyrics/topics and partly based on the music itself.  I love big band music (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, et. al) probably because I played alot of that in the jazz bands I was in in high school and college.  But for straight artistry, I love classical music (in the general definition of orchestral music).  Bach, Beethoven Tchaichovsky, Mussorgsky, Rossini, Copland, Wagner, Gershwin, even some Bernstein, and on and on.

Sorry for drifting off topic there, but my point was that I had never thought about the fact that my taste in music has not changed much over the years and how that relates to heart and mind.  That would be an interesting study (what do changes in taste of art reflect on the growth of person?)  I bet some doctoral candidate has studied that at some point."], "gold_label": 1.0}

After I announced I was voting straight Libertarian Ticket in 2004, I had a rather heated debate with the die-hard Republicans around here. The primary reason they cited for NOT voting Libertarian for President was that I would 'waste' my vote. Though they agreed with me (for the most part) on Libertarian views, they could not make the conceptual leap to vote with their conscience. I was criticized for 'not trying to change the Republican Party from within.'   I countered with the following:   1. I was active in politics in my youth and was elected a precinct delegate for the Republican party in my hometown in 1988.  2. I actively campaigned for George H.W. Bush based on the premise that he would 'stay the course' of continuing Reagan's policies.  3. When Bush Sr. went back on his promise, I was deeply troubled...but I did vote for him in 1992 because I hated Bill Clinton.  4. Starting in 1996 I split my ticket, Republican for President, and Libertarian for all other offices.  5. Hopeful that the Republicans who controlled both the House and Senate would limit the size of government in addition to cutting taxes, I voted for Bush in 2000.   I DID try to change the party from within...and I am tired of it.&nbsp; It's pointless and fruitless.&nbsp; I basically came to the conclusion that it was time to vote&nbsp;in a different direction.&nbsp;   It is now apparent to me that the Republican party is only moderately better than the Democrats ...or should I say not as bad. They have increased the size of government 5%+, passed the horrible Medicare and Education Bills, expanded protectionist trade policies (subsidies and tariffs), and pushed the Patriot Act through under the banner of increasing national security.   The other concern I have with this election is that the winner will likely be able to appoint at least one Supreme Court Justice. However, Bush (and Congress) have failed to stand up for any of his appointments which leads me to believe he would never appoint a strict constitutionalist and he'd stick us with another Justice Souter.   The only things I believe the Republicans got right were the tax cuts and the prosecution of the war on Terror (for the most part).   Though Liberals may whine about the 2000 election being 'stolen' by the Supreme Court, I have a serious problem with any justice that considers the Constitution a 'living' document. The activist Supreme Court has superseded their powers and is writing law rather than interpreting it.   To me, the Libertarian Party best exemplifies what I believe in:   1. Greatly reducing the role of the Federal Government.  2. Greatly reducing taxes (I personally prefer a  urlLink National Sales Tax .  3. Eliminating government subsidies and tariffs which only hide inefficient businesses and are non-competitive.  4. Elimination of ALL foreign aid. Screw the rest of the world...they hate us anyway. We'll trade with them, but we wont' give them money. Furthermore, we should enact a 'mirror' policy with our trade partners. If they won't trade fairly (such as China), then we won't either. Emergency AID for disasters would be acceptable.  5. Ending the 'War' on Drugs.  6. Stay the hell out of the home. This includes anti-gay laws, drugs,etc. What happens in the home between to consenting adults is NONE of the government's business so long as they aren't killing each other, hurting anyone else, or stealing from anyone else.  7. Elimination of Affirmative Action. This is used as a crutch by the weak minorities and an insult the capable. Furthermore, it's condescending to minorities as it says, 'You're not good enough to compete fairly so we'll tilt the field.'   Though I take issue with the Libertarian Party on Defense and Immigration, I believe since the party is still relatively young, I can help to change the Libertarian Party from within."], "gold_label": 0.0}

When we got there the owner was just leaving with a bundle of yarn to make another sample for her shop and the new clerk, Christina, was working.  Alicen and I walked around looking at all the samples, touching some amazing yarn and then sat on the floor by the toys and books so Alicen could play and Christina and I looked through knitting books and talked about knitting.  It was fabulous.  I confessed I hadn't come in as much as I would like to because I was on a strict budget at the moment.  She didn't hesitate to say I should just come in to hang out and knit, talk about knitting whatever.  I was so pleased.  I told her I was making my first sweater and she asked me to bring it in and show her the progress on it.  She loved Alicen's poncho and wanted to know if I would write up the pattern.

Apparently, this stems from people using their hands to create quotation marks while talking...so they feel like doin' it where and whenever they want. Assholes!

I was chatting with one of my friends from Lebanon when his bad english and my bad english started annoying me. Finally, having decided to put forth some effort in to the situation, I went to Google, the oracle of planet earth, and typed in 'Arabic translation'. First search result was a winner, because it was Google, (p.s. if you type in Bruce Werner in Google I'm number 1, so there you go) and I was brought to an  urlLink Arabic to English and vice-versa online site .  This was a little shocking because I thought the limit of our on-the-fly translation on the web were spanish, french, and german. However I found out that technology has indeed progressed to the point where I can type english, and he can read Arabic. From his conversation, I could tell what I typed was exactly what I got... and he instantly opened up whole paragraphs of conversation in Arabic as if the tower of Babel had never been destroyed and we were all one happy human family.  Which got me thinking...  1) How long will it take writing arabic in an MSN chat window before Aschcroft pays me a visit? 2) How stupid is it to learn a foreign language in 10 years if all our PDAs and phones will be able to instantly translate voice and text? (IBM, good ol' IBM) 3) What type of planet will it be when the language barrier is broken indefintely? 4) Will God, or gods, or various religious wackos who believe in God, fear that with the tower of Babel rebuilt as it were, we are gonna be punished?  Really, to be flip about the incredible experience I had with my Lebanon friend is under-selling the incredible earth changing effect this will have on humanity. It truly is the rebuilding of the Babel tower, in defiance of God's will in myth, and the creation of a human family that will have the barriers broken and open dialogue truly open.   As  urlLink Lambert Dolphin puts it in  his great but ultimately confusing piece on the Tower of Babel:   However, the heart of the matter is made clear in these words, 'let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.' Already a haunting fear had set in. They were conscious already of a disruptive influence in their midst, of a centrifugal force that was pushing them apart so they could not live too closely together and which would ultimately, they feared, scatter them abroad and leave them unknown, unhonored, and unsung, living in isolated communities where they would be exposed to great danger. The fear of this caused them to build a tower and a city. The ultimate motive is expressed in these words, 'let us make a name for ourselves.'   Are we now to 'make a name for ourselves' as a human culture?  Don't think 'we've had that at the UN and in government for hundreds of years'. Because as we all know, the world doesn't change at those places, it is only reflected in those places. The world changes here.. with us.. with millions of people talking and sharing their lives, and wanting to be a part of other lives. It's a remarkable thing what the future will hold for us. If we can talk to and understand Arabs, Indians, and Chinease without the need of them or us to have several years of language education, what would that do? Maybe the Indian who got the telemarketing job that moved from US will tell us on a small chat room how happy he is he can feed his family well... maybe the Arab will discuss how horrible it is to have to be afraid to step out their door or having their hosues demolished in Palastine in an instant messaging window. All of this will reach out where experience is personal and not just some image flashing across the screen of BBC World News.  I know there are unreasonable and warped people in the world, whom you can live just down the street from and whom will always be defensive, combative, and mean. I know there are people who take pleasure in being witty to one's detrement, sharp to increase one's wound, and who will retire with their social group to congradulate themselves. We need not witness or reflect on the mis-understandings and cycle of violence in Isreal and elsewhere to understand how weak un-educated humanity can be, we need only look to our neighbors at times.  However by breaking down one more barrier in our lives, we can more easily hope that shows of amature and childish behavior, of unthoughtful action based mearly on the idea of inflicting wounds, and the tendency to re-inforce positions with un-yeilding hard-headedness and ignorance will be eliminated.  We may still dis-like some of our neighbor's behavior, but at least we can count more of them as such."], "gold_label": 0.0}

So we fly to Europe( I suppose so that part wasn't in the dream).  We are at C.'s flat, which in the dream is more like a huge loft. And  I hardly see C. while we are there. We basically make ourselves at home, and show ourselves around. We talk briefly with C.'s sister, and neice.   Then the wedding day comes. We are in our dresses, running around like chickens with our head cut off, and I haven't any nice shoes.. I look around and around.. and shop (at a store convienantly located in the house, and find nothing.. so I basically end up wearing some old shoes I had that were like slippers and white. And then, we have no flowers or decorations, so we use some flowers that C. has in his house, and the same for decorations.    We get married, and it looks like a zoo, no organization at all, but we look happy. Then afterwards, C is on a bicycle and wanting to ride down the hill, and I hop on the bicycle with him, and we race down the hill. ( I am thinking .. WTF.. and laughing at the same time)   Also some things that happen in the dream, is that D. gets sick, and some guy I know, supposedly in the dream, a Doctor, comes to fix her up. I get this bad feeling and stop him. In the meantime someone has called the cops. We find out he was trying to poison her.  It was very scary.  Then, part of the dream we find out C. had a twin brother.. (who looks nothing like him) this guy is raggedy and apparently he is always in the basement, working.  I figured he's either a strange artist or a slave in the dream.   Then, something I forgot, before C. and I ride off on the bicycle, we talk to his uncle. His uncle wants to buy this book, apparently an antique, and C. says he can have it for 15 dollars..  Uncle opens the book and laughs, saying it is worth much more. C. just shruggs, uncle hands him some money, and C. hands it to me.  I start counting the money, it is much more than 15 dollars.   That is all I can remember of the dream right now, but maybe later some more will come to me. I got to get going, got a long day ahead of me.

Writing about diaspora is complicated stuff.

The production of Chinese movies in these places were very much affected by Chinese populations in Southeast Asia and the United States. So I'm trying to capture the ephermality when it comes to the idea of a 'national' cinema, for a borderless population. I guess that's why there are whole books on writing about diaspora.  I guess this brings into the question of identity for immigrant populations, which is something that my friends and I have been talking about lately. As Rey Chow writes, a way of dealing with diaspora is, 'to  unlearn  that submission to one's ethnicity such as 'Chineseness' as the ultimate signified.' (page 25 of  Writing Diaspora ). Chow doesn't say that one's background is to be ignored, but at the same time she doesn't think something like being Chinese is an all encompassing and total experience.  Anyway...

He has this adorable dog (Winston) who really is the chubbiest and cutest thing I have ever seen. (That was true until he woke me up this morning) HA HA &nbsp; Josh and I went out for dinner at this amazing place that is also in Indiana called Fazzoli's. It's fast food Italian and it's so good. They have unlimited free breadsticks and I always eat baked ziti. It's sooooo good!&nbsp; Josh always knows how I love to eat! Later on we decided to go to a movie with Josh's friend (may I add here that this guy is beautiful) Dan! We went to see Spiderman2 and it was a decent movie except I can't speak for the 10 minutes that I literally slept because I was so tired. Josh ended up waking me up though and I watched the rest. Not a bad movie at all!  &nbsp; Today Josh has to work for a little bit so I am 'Home Alone.' HA HA I decided I would blog rather quickly and log my first day in the beautiful state of Colorado. I am really happy because I was hoping it would rain while I was here. For those of you that don't understand this, it's because it NEVER rains in Southern California and I miss the rain. It rained last night so I was happy and the air smelled so clean! I have no idea what Josh and I are doing tonight other than I am watching him play indoor soccer. You all know (most likely) that I love to watch soccer. It's the socks!  &nbsp; By the way, I should note that I had a special boy call me last night and that was fun. He wanted to know when we could 'see' each other?! I was pretty stoked. Oh well, for today, I am just enjoying quiet, solitude, no drama, and total fun in the land of Josh McCall. I love my guy friends! Have a great day everyone and Josh, if you are reading this....I love you and your hospitality! ~Shalom~\n\nText 2:HAL, I suppose you could say it was a cry for help - a cry to plan another Pandyland Jamboree maybe.

I didn't get home from school until 10:45 PM on Tuesday and last night I was reading. I get to enjoy even more reading today. I really need to get into the groove of massive reading.  Well... let's see what's new with me. I got emails from Rafael, Esther, and Shanna recently which was cool. Those are all people I haven't talked to seen in ages. It was quite cool to hear from them. Heh... I also sent one of those screaming ghost things to Steff, and she responded that she opened it up and work. Hah... that must have been a funny sight! I feel bad... truly I do, but man... they made the entertainment factor go way up.  Today... I get to do more photocopying, buy some really expensive books, and read. Oh and I also need to go to the DMV to try to become a NY state resident.  In rotation lately has been  Millencolin .  ***\n\nText 2:This is the first use of my new Blog. I hope it is as entertaining as it is thought provoking as I want it to be.&nbsp; I guess I can give a little background information about myself. My name is Breanne. I am 23 years old. I live with my boyfriend, 4 cats, and 1&nbsp;scared beta fish. I just started a month ago at my current job. I work in the Information Technology field. I waited long and hard for a position in IT.    I graduated from&nbsp;college in November of 2002 with a BA. in Computer Information Systems.&nbsp; I tried my hardest from August 2002 to December 2002 to get any permenant job.&nbsp; I had to give up and go to temping. From there is where I worked at several places including the place I am a permanent employee now. I was at VW as a temp then had to leave because they wouldn't hire me perm. I went off to Sho-Link.&nbsp; Who would of thought it would go from bad to much much worse. I never knew a 'Dilbert' office or an 'Office Space' office really would exist.&nbsp;  There I encountered all the things that made a bad business. There was nepotism, favortism, shovanism, sexual harrassment, drug usage, and just plain stupid people.  My first day, I met everyone. I went in there thinking everything will be good and fine.&nbsp; My first day wanted to send me running. They smoked in the office, causing me to get migranes all week. They did take me out to lunch the first two days but the rest of the week I ate alone and from that point on I ate alone because they didn't want me in their clique (3 people were really clique). This girl, Deborah, was the administrative assistant.&nbsp; She seemed loud, angry, and repressed. After me and her were left there at the end of the day while all the higher up people got to leave before 8 hrs was up, she would sit with me and bitch about how horrible the company was. She told me past stories of things that absolutely struck fear into my heart.&nbsp; I would often go home&nbsp; and cry.&nbsp; Her misery spread into my misery.&nbsp; My misery over the next 10 months turned into my own misery, a reality that I couldn't bear.  Jenny, my supervisor, was the dumb blonde that always laughed at what you said yet when you complained, she would brush you off.&nbsp; She talked incessantly about herself and would completely tune out others while she went on and on.&nbsp; All you really had to do was knod and say yes every once in awhile.&nbsp; I started avoiding her after 3 months.&nbsp; Every once in awhile she would corner me in my office and make me talk about something about herself that I didn't give a rats ass about.&nbsp; She didn't give a rats ass about me, so I could hardly care for her.&nbsp;  While I was there I got really sick.&nbsp; The pressures of having to be at the office 40 hrs a week with no leeway was too much. I had a rough February with moving into a new apartment. They weren't particularly fond of anyone taking off work and would talk trash about the person if they were gone.&nbsp; It made me reluctant to be gone. It made me want to be around so they wouldn't gang up on me behind my back.&nbsp; I also attempted to ask if I could leave 30 minutes early for two months so I could take a class, and they said no. I couldn't believe&nbsp;Jenny.&nbsp; Her excuse is she has an office to run, but she is never there.&nbsp; Also, 30 minutes isn't asking for much.&nbsp; At that point, I loathed her.&nbsp; I was determined to leave Sho-Link at this point.  At Sho-Link, I was a CS Rep. There was a girl,&nbsp;Shannon,&nbsp;that had my position before me that worked at one of the other companies we did business with. Ironically enough, not only did they attempt to fire this girl in the past, but recommended her to the other company, Derse.&nbsp; This girl hated me instantly because I had her old position. She tried to make my life hell at that company. And it worked. She got exactly the reaction from Jenny and the president, Alan that she wanted.&nbsp; She constantly was trying to get me in trouble. It first started with her stating I did an order wrong that cost them tons of money. I ended up proving her wrong. Another mistake is one time she called 15 til 5pm and I said, Oh I turned off my computer. Let me turn it back on.&nbsp; That next day I got 'disiplined' by my supervisor, Jenny.&nbsp; I couldn't believe they were making this such a big deal. The things that girl got away with when she worked here were far greater than turning off a computer a little early.&nbsp; She would stretch the truth about me always. She told them I turned off my computer an hour early. It was quite ridiculous. She couldn't prove anything, but I could because Deborah was there.  Another instance with this girl, Shannon was she came to an office baby shower uninvited.&nbsp; Everyone felt really uncomfortable. When she left the room, I said she makes me feel uncomfortable to the VP, Scott.&nbsp; He took this comment, told the president, Alan, and the whole office got in trouble for it.&nbsp; I thought it was insane that everyone got in trouble over that. I had a right to say how I felt in a non-insulting manner.&nbsp; After all the things she had done to me, I had a right to feel SOMETHING.&nbsp;  Sho-Link has a end of the year party every year(its really a Christmas Party). Me and my boyfriend went. My boyfriend that night got totally tanked. While he was dancing with me, he slammed his head into mine, cutting open his skin above his eye.&nbsp; We had to rush him to the emergency room. The VP, Scott, took us there. My boyfriend was puking everywhere and crying. I ended up taking him back to the hotel and I left him for a few minutes. I went up to the Presidents room where they were having a party.&nbsp; Alan attempted to take a cleevage shot of my breasts.&nbsp; I left the room.&nbsp; I was already humiliated enough.&nbsp; I ended up staying up all night cleaning up Brian's vomit.&nbsp; I wanted to never see those people again.&nbsp; When I went to work that next week, they laughed and teased me about it. They said something happens to someone every year. My opinion of the majority of these people was not a good one.&nbsp; I didn't feel any better being compared to someone else at that company.  While I was there, I slowly became good friends with Deborah and Carrie.&nbsp; Deb more than Carrie though.&nbsp; Deborah was really fun to be around.&nbsp; She was smart, inteligent, deligent, and on her way to becoming successful.&nbsp; I clung to her for the only intelligent conversation and common interests we had outside of work.&nbsp; Carrie and I shared an office and became friends in a way that made me learn a lot from her.&nbsp; She made me laugh and was fun to be around.&nbsp; She would talk about anything.  In&nbsp;March of 2004, I received a call from my old friend Margaret at VW. She said they were going to have an open position in her area and I could do that job. She asked if I was interested. I said yes. I wanted out. I never thought it was going to happen. Two months trickled by without a word from anyone. Finally, while searching Monster.com, I saw my job on there!&nbsp; I was outraged, upset, disturbed, and sad.&nbsp; I was passed up again!&nbsp; So, I applied again anyway.&nbsp; A few more weeks goes by and I get called in for an interview.&nbsp; I was nearly jumping out of my skin for weeks. I was so excited. I went to the interview and it was awesome. I did better at that interview than any other one in the past. I was not even nervous.&nbsp; I thought for sure I had this one.&nbsp; At the end of the week, I received a call offering me the job. I was stoked!&nbsp; I put in my two weeks notice the following Monday and here I am.&nbsp; I work at VW&nbsp; in the field of MY CHOICE."], "gold_label": 0.0}

If any of you know me very well at all, you'll know I have a severe distaste for smokers.  I won't bother listing all of the things that bug me about the filthy habit because it's been said before.  But let's just say this: some people are passionate about peace, other about animal rights.  This time I'm not fighting the smokers for myself or any other human being.  I'm going to war for the tree.  Across the street from our building is a lone pine tree that has to sit at the edge of the property.  It is this tree that every smoker from across the street gathers to engage in their ceremony of stink.  All kinds of pigs waddle across the lawn to get to this poor tree to light up, bitch about work, and smoke to their tar-stained heart's content.  Now, if you know most smokers (like I do) they don't bother disposing of their filthy habit properly.  Take a drive on the freeway for example.  How often do you see some asshole fire a butt out the window because he doesn't want to 'stink up his car' or 'surround himself in his disgusting weakness?'  The same applies for the poor pine tree.  They fire their butts on the ground and pollute the poor tree with their rancid smoke screens.  So, what I'm doing is making signs that I'm going to put in the ground next to the tree.  They're going to be high-quality signs that will be laminated, fastened to a pointed stick and inserted into the ground.  The signs are going to have little messages on them that will (hopefully) make the smokers feel like gruesome beasts and remind them of what social lepers they are.  One sign will say:   Hey Smokers!  This is the Pine Tree Talking:  PICK UP YOUR BUTTS. I dont want to suffer because  of your filthy habit.   Another one says:   Mmmmm.Delicious Cigarettes.   You know what else is delicious???  CANCER. Enjoy Your Day.   -The Tree   I'm planning on making 12 different signs.  I will plant them one week from today and let the fun begin.  Of course, I'll keep everyone up to date on what happens.  I can see the tree and all of the sweathogs that go down there to smoke from my desk."], "gold_label": 1.0}

When women had beauty, they abused it.  Thus, although the definition of beauty had traditionally been formed with a pitifully feminine vocabulary, the new avant-garde found no reason to allow women to take part in beauty.  Women are too frivolous and physical for the aesthetic elevation that beauty can offer, and women are unsuited to inspiring beauty. Many artists eliminated the traditional objects of beauty and aspire to some mistaken concept of the sublime.    First, artists found a requirement of deprivation in beauty and gathered that the perceiver should punish the work.  By making a work of art an object of sustained regard, our active spectatorship is destructive to a beautiful object.  The idea of the monstrous attracted artists like Rauschenberg, and some found that to be monstrous was to prove their true artistic nature and show their disdain for all things bourgeois.  To be monstrous, an object\u2019s size defeats the end that forms its concept.  The creator is unable to love the created, and the created takes over the creator.  Whereas our sense of the beautiful had previously been based on communication, such as an interchange of sympathy, the relationship between the work of art and the art-lover has been changed.  Worse is the relationship between the art-lover and the work of art exciting a feeling of the sublime.  The work punishes and overwhelms the viewer with mental agitation.  The feeling of the sublime calls upon reason, understanding, and memory as well as imagination.  In its crudest form, this sublime may be characterized as monstrous or ugly.  In attempting to step away from the Greek standard of beauty, avant-garde artists headed straight toward the ugly, missing the path to the sublime.   Art becomes little more than an object as the audience is reduced to a stereotype unable to understand it.  Avant-garde artists have created a counterculture through their manifestoes in which they destroy the common values and pleasures of aesthetic experience.  The aesthetic experience has become separate from everyday events; the feeling of the sublime as these artists understood it was primarily marked by the freedom of thrilling detachment from the ordinary.  Whereas a judgment of beauty requires the subject of the experience to become worthy of the object of beauty, the feeling of the sublime is marked by a non-recognition of one\u2019s self in the other.\n\nText 2:I think I have it. If it exists, I do.   Basically, the premise is that employers encourage their employees to be happy all the time (i.e., my 'life is terrific' button, those motivational posters and calendars, etc.).

I tend to have fine days every day -- really, I do -- but I tell people 70 times a day 'have a good evening/afternoon/day' and it becomes meaningless. Every day might be a good day, but then what about the  really  good days? Our language won't admit to that without falling to silly words like fabulous, terrific, the like.

Certain meaning in specific areas, and none in other areas. For instance, I know I'm right most of the time. Why? Because I have a photographic memory. I can walk into a store and just be walking around, not looking for anything in particular, and a week later my mother can ask me how much milk is at the store and I know how much it is. I read an obscene amount (amassing huge collections of random facts that dazzle people who will listen) and I use my large vocabulary when talking. Yea, I'm arrogant, and I know it. I'm fucking narcissistic and I know that, too. I don't really give a shit.      It's just when my family degrades me and says things like 'go stand in your closet and stay there' or 'who cares, you live in fantasy land all the time anyway' that upset me. I don't understand it at all. I'm so cynical of the world, the only way I can survive is to read and  live in my fantasy world . The real world disgusts me so much that if I didn't have my own domain (my room, where I read and write and  live ) I would have gone through with the suicide attempts a long time ago. Like in the fifth grade when I first tried and almost succeeded to OD on random pills.      They disgust me so much. They gang up on me and I don't have a clue why. What the fuck, you would think they would be used to my ugliness and conceitedness. It especially upsets me when my stepfather makes jeering comments or sounds ('oink oink') when I'm looking for something to eat or am doing  nothing . Except usually when I'm out of my room someone will usually tell me to go back to my cave.       Oh, I have gone into this too long. I really hate to post depressed writing in here. They were just doing it all again and I am upset. I just went there to talk and play with my cat, but no. It turns into a ganging up on me once again, with my brother making lewd comments and doing imitations of me, and my stepfather doing much of the aforementioned.      But why I really wanted to post, before I got caught up in all that, is that I've implimented something new into my blog. On the sidebar I'm adding something. By January 1st, 2005, I want to have jogged 250 miles. Yes. There are 137 days remaining this year, and that averages 1.83 miles per day. Not a lot for a person in shape, which is why after January 1st I want to start running more. The 250 miles is just to get me in shape and geared for the Big Year. The Year of Graduation and All. Sooo...I'm making an image I'll update every Sunday night or so, with numbers of miles to run left, along with miles ran so far and days left to achieve this.      So thanks all, for being supportive of me. I hope you will all still be supportive during this time too, because I'll need a lot of willpower to do this. I usually get into shape and then quit running, get out of shape, and then repeat the whole thing again. This time I'm trying to stay in shape permanently.       On another note somewhat related, I really enjoy reading everyone's comments. I know I'm not interesting a lot of the time but it means a lot that I can count on you all.

From the site:  The National Science Foundation (NSF) released its first call for proposals for the National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) program early in 2000. Building on work supported under the multi-agency Digital Libraries Initiative, this program aims to establish a national digital library that will constitute an online network of learning environments and resources for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education at all levels.   BACKGROUND   Fiscal year 1994 marked the beginning of the Digital Libraries Initiative (DLI), a multi-agency research effort involving the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). NSF served as the lead agency in this program that provided support for basic research into the transformative potential of information technology as applied to library and information science.  Six multi-year projects were funded in the first four years, featuring collaborations of researchers and users from a variety of organizations, including leading universities, state agencies, secondary schools, prominent libraries and museums, the publishing community, government laboratories, and the computer and communications industry. In a brief note in Educom Review, Paul Evan Peters (1995) provided very short summaries of these projects; but more importantly he posited the term 'digital library' as the logical replacement for what Peters called two prior terms of art: the 'electronic library,' with its basic 'bits on silicon rather than ink on paper' concept, and the 'virtual library,' as captured in the idea of 'not only what you own but what you have access to.' (It bears mentioning that this same early to mid-1990s time period also marked the emergence of the first text-based browsers, which were followed very quickly by graphical browsers.)  In 1995 initial thinking about digital libraries for science education began with an internal concept paper for the NSF Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE), and the concepts were developed and informed by a series of workshops and accompanying reports (Manduca & Mogk, 1999; NRC, 1998, 1999; NSF, 1998, 1999a, 1999b). By FY98 the initial DLI had gained more partner agencies and under the umbrella of a new DLI-2 effort, a prototype program was conducted for two years to explore the application of digital library research to undergraduate science education test beds. Spurred by both enthusiasm from the broad educational community and both the legislative and executive branches for the promise of digital libraries to enable improvements in education, the formal NSDL program (http://www.ehr.nsf.gov/ehr/due/programs/nsdl) was established in 2000.\n\nText 2:urlLink Reform Initiatives in Higher Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Elaine El-Khawas.  It examines different attempts at reform in academia.  From the ERIC Digest:  Reform initiatives are numerous in American higher education. Their messages and hopes are widely documented through conferences, journals, newsletters, and funded projects. Many membership associations, networks and informal alliances actively promote new directions for higher education.   The history of American higher education reveals a continuing stream of reform that has affected academic programs, degree requirements, methods of instruction, and organizational structures (Rudolph, 1977; Altbach, 1980; Curry, 1992; Gaff and Ratcliff, 1996). General education requirements have been overhauled, new fields of studies introduced, and new institutions established, all without being labeled as reforms (El-Khawas, 1996).   Visible as these activities are, reform movements are poorly understood as a mechanism by which higher education changes. Levine (1980) described several general patterns. As he noted, reform is usually described in terms of its typical phases: the initiation phase, when aims are set out; the implementation phase, when ideas are put into operation; and a final, institutionalization phase, when reforms try to achieve a stable, enduring form. Presidential leadership is been said to be important, with visible leadership support seen as crucial in getting reforms off the ground. A common assumption is that most reforms are unsuccessful because they come into conflict with ongoing programs or otherwise fail to win broad acceptance. Many reforms are thought to survive only in enclaves, somewhat removed from mainstream programs, or survive only if they change substantially from their original purposes."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.

But somewhat, I feel that I've started a new term and a new life all over again. Its wierd, spooky, uncertain. That's what it is. In a sense it is new, in a sense it is not. Yes yes, I'm at it again, maybe the tagline for this blog shall be 'getting metaphysical on your ass'. But anyway, let's get back on track. And is there any track to begin with lol. Sometimes, when I feel lost, I just simply start a new post here, and who knows what I'm gonna write.  Listening to 'Fly away' by Liang Jing ru, its amazing though. How I got into chinese pop into the first place. I was a 'see ang moh kao'. Literally translated as a dead caucasian dog. But anyway, putting it into context is a totally different thing. I just bought her album, the 'lian ai de li liang' one. I mean, it was NOT an objective, rational. Ok....I've got 20 bucks, there is this CD then this CD so I'll get this. Nah, its more like, uhhhh, just get this CD, where can I get 20 bucks?  For the first time, I've bought a CD using my heart instead of my head. And really, I did not consider whether there is adequate 'musical fusion' or uhhhh, 'auditory colouration' or maybe have kickass guitar solos. No, what touched me is the sincerity. Her musicians may not be the best around, heck, it has neither musical fusion nor auditory colouration. But yea, music is always best when you can relate to it. She has influenced me alot as a person, I can say, maybe not as a musician. And yea yea corny but it has helped me tide over some difficult periods. And maybe some of you are familiar with these 'difficult periods' as I have said.  Its very situational, and the songwriting's relatively good. English pop is mostly crap. American industry money-spinning shit. Yea, the chinese pop world have their own fair share of such people. F4? But there are some people out there who can really make songs which move you.   Love, love, lemme talk about it. Someone once said Love is like a golden shackle in a cushioned birdcage. Uhhhh actually you don't have to figure out exactly who said it, cos' I came up with it lol. Anyway, I have learnt quite a bit (understatement perhaps). I may feel the liberation, the fact that I'm kinda out of the birdcage, but there's one thing I lack, security. The security which I had in the past. The security that there's always someone I can depend on, I can run to when I feel down and out. I'm not saying that its a bad thing, nah, its actually pretty ambivalent if you look at it. What do you want? Freedom or security.  But realizing that there's someone I can run to. But also, my heart's not with me. My heart's not mine, I can't control it, my emotions, sometimes its hard to mask it and it shows. Sure, there's security but I find myself sharing all problems and joys which are not mine. Of course, it is a sacred and wonderful thing, but if applied in the right context.   I don't wish to elaborate more........but as school's starting and my mind starts to work, expect more posts here.   :)"], "gold_label": 0.0}

So it went like this: Harris and Edwin came walking and Edwin put his hands on my eyes and I said 'Hmm, cold hands... It's Sandra!' and he took off his hands, and I saw who it was and I was all 'Oh, it's Edwin' and giggled.  I have a lot of guys I like...They are: -Diego G., because he's cute and nice and a trouble maker >D -Abraham, because he's really sweet and really flirty -Israel {aka Izzy}, because he's quiet and really cute -Edwin, because he seems really sweet and he's insane like, Julia, Marnie, Lissette, and X-ine, and I ^_^.  Alyssa was absent today so at snack I went to the blacktop and saw Jaime and hung out with her until snack ended and I went walking a lone to math.  At Lunch, I went to bookdrop first because my 'Hot Topic' bag broke.  The red string I use it as something for my hand, like an accessorie.

How quick we are as humans to look out for #1 (ourselves).  It is a trait passed on from society since earliest of times (re: survival of the fittest).  We're ALL selfconscious of this trait in ourselves, wether we want to or not.  I'll be first in line to say that I am.  As much as we would like to give our all, there's always something in our heads saying 'is it worth it?', 'will i just end up getting hurt?', 'does this person deserve to have all of me?', etc.  Believe me I know the feeling of giving my ALL to someone and end up being hurt in the end of it all.  But I have no regrets.  I have given to those what I can, and that is all i can offer to people i come across.  I get advice from friends to be careful.  I question it by thinking 'what for?'  If i was meant to have certain feelings at a time in my life, i would rather not hold them back for the sake of being hurt or possibly losing someone in my life.  I would want them to know how special they are to me and they deserve to know that.  If i dont get the same response back, so be it.  All i know is that i want to give back the love i've recieved from them, wether they knew of it or not.  I'm so glad to say that i can't change that part of me, and even so blessed that i've found out this...   i have something to share with you all.  We all (well, at least most of the readers of my blog i know of) know and obey the ten commandments given by God through Moses, right?  and as soon as we know we've broken one of them, our hearts hold heavy until the chance to reconcile our mistakes.  now, i dunno why a particular commandment is overlooked.  maybe its because Charlton Heston hasn't starred in a movie about it yet.  but here we are, knowing the 10 that Moses spoke of...but yet we tend to forget to obey what our Lord, our Savior, came down to Earth and spoke of this new commandment:   'I give you a new commandment: love one another.  As I have loved you, so you also should love one another.  This is how all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.'  (John 13:34-35)  Here He is,  OUR LORD HIMSELF , proclaiming words that we must follow, how he wants us all to be.  We've all felt the Lord's love, we know what it's like.  Sure the feeling doesn't last til forever, but we've all had a taste of it.  Why are we hesitant to share it with others?  I believe we owe it to God to try to show the love He has given us.  especially to others that aren't open to Jesus' love just yet...but rather your love.  one they can physically see and feel, and from there it'll all happen in God's time.  A simple smile, compliment or encouragement radiates Jesus within us to others.   I understand the heartache of giving your all to someone and not recieving it in return.  It hurts, physically it hurts our heart to even think about what was went through.  But was Jesus ever 'careful'?    Even when he knew people would not follow him, he would offer them opportunity to do so: A rich young man came to Jesus and asked Him, 'Teacher, what good must i do to gain eternal life?' Jesus replied.   'If you wish to be perfect, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.  Then come, follow me.' (matt 19:21)  Now Jesus, I'm sure, knew the young man would not give up all his riches to join Him.  and i'm sure His human side felt heartache for someone chose material things over being with Him.  But yet he still showed love to the young man and gave him the opportunity to become a disciple.  Jesus did not get mad at the young man for not understanding at the time.  Thats something only God's love would be able to get you through.  Are there times we feel like being there for someone but dont because we know the person well enough that they won't appreciate you being there for them?  Believe me i've had my conficts and hesitations with that.  but you know i'll tell you guys personally...going for it is worth it.  you may not get to them now, but at least you know that you've tried all you can and someday, it'll register to them.  might not be through you exactly, but once they come to the realization that you've shown them love at a difficult time, they'll appreciate it so much then. and i'm pretty sure God will be happy that you've obeyed what He has told us before He physically left Earth.  even if they never come to appreciate it, just know that you were able to show Jesus through you by doing so.  i have been trying my best to LOVE everyone, through whatever means they're able understand.  it's really hard because everyone has a different personality and take things differently.  Just try to find Jesus in you to lead his LOVE and it'll come out.  don't expect it to be in abundance either, something so little from you could mean a whole lot to them.  please don't hold back, its not worth it.  we never know when our last day on Earth will be, show the world our all before its too late.  Pain is temporary.   LOVE IS FOREVER .  peace be with you."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I know my dad has a really soft side, although he never shows it, I know it's there, it's apparent whenever I fuck up hard, or my brother does something extremely stupid.  Me, it's about the same thing, I'm a real softie when it comes to things, but I rarely show it (at least I don't think I don't.. correct me if I'm wrong).  My dad is a stubborn fool, as am I, he gambles like crazy, as do I, and you know what, he has a bottle of brandy sitting in the kitchen and I think he got it sometime during Christmas and now it's nearly empty.  Although I haven't drunk any of it, I've though about it though.  I just stare at it, and wonder, hmm 'I wonder what it tastes like.'  I dunno, I'm turning out to be the person I never wanted to be.    I use to look at my dad as a failure, because he's a labourer, a proletariat if you will, and I didn't want to be that, and all this time, I've been lieing to myself, all this time I've been trying to live a life that I don't belong to.  All this time, I've been trying to get away from myself.  I admit, I enjoy simple things, maybe it's the fact I've lost all interest in studies lately, but generally, I don't think I would be that happy being a white-collar worker.  I dunno, maybe I'm just crazy, but I have serious doubts these days, I have serious doubts about university, and I have serious doubts about what I want to do with my life.  Everyone says they want to be something, but what if I just want to be?    I've been looking at my marks lately, and have been crunching the numbers like there's no tomorrow, and I have serious doubts of getting into Waterloo or Toronto, and in reality I don't really want to go to Queen's or McMaster, I just applied there for who knows why (probably to save myself face, if I fuck up hard.)   I dunno, things are different now, maybe I might become a teacher if nothing works out, or maybe I'll take a year off and go to RCC and take that route if nothing works out.  I'm just not sure anymore, I mean, what is there to be sure of these days?  I remember when I was in like Grade 9, school was life and that was all there was to it, and I grew up kinda quickly I guess, I sat around doing school work and I guess I enjoyed it, and these days, there's none of that, no enjoyment at all.  It's merely tedious drivel trying to move onto the next step, which consists of another 4 years of the same thing.  Man, I dunno, fuck I wish I ray of clarity would just shine down on me right now so I know what to do with my life.  As crazy as it sounds, I'm quite content with earning enough money to do whatever, not too much of course, just enough to survive and have a few luxuries.  And by luxuries I'm just talking about shelter, car, food, and high-speed internet access :)  So yeah, I dunno, I'm confused, I'm tired, I'm just not sure of anything anymore.  There's no certainty in my life anymore, and that scares me, I'm scared of the fact that maybe tomorrow, I won't be me anymore, or that I won't be something that I wanted to be.  I just want some clarity, that's all.\n\nText 2:Oi, another 13 hours shift.  Jesus, my eyes are so burning right now, and all I have to show for it is coloured paper.

I see... a spider web is tangled up with me!'   'Trouble', from  Parachutes , by Coldplay  I went to  urlLink One Day 2003  expecting and thinking that I would hear God.  God did indeed speak, but He didn't do it in the same way as He did through the last One Day.  He used the last One Day to revolutionize my spiritual outlook; it led me to a path to I realize that God's passion for His glory has deep ramifications throughout every aspect of reality and every way we understand and interact with it.  Thus, I expected a similar revolution to occur, but I found that I already 'knew' what the speakers talked about.  Instead, God showed me the reality of my ignorance of what I knew, of what messages the One Day organizers hoped to convey.  Although I knew everything in my mind, the emptiness and disconnection in my heart made me realize the ignorance of my spirit, my heart, and my soul.  The song lyrics used throughout worship left me hesistant in singing along, because I saw a deep rift between what they stated and my actual attitude and heart in my daily life.  Yes, worship is only true worship because of Christ alone.  However, this worship authenticates itself in our experience through our lives, and I'm realizing that I've slipped in my true heart of worship over the past couple of years.  God's already throwing many new curveballs into my life.  I am starting to endure those thoughts that tell me to shut down again, that say that I'm a failure and that I won't make it.  If there's anything I got out of this past weekend trip, it's to FINALLY START BELIEVING that God is true, God is righteous, and God will always keep His promises.  I haven't really believed it in my heart to the point that these beliefs shaped my attitudes and choices in life.  Instead, I let circumstances, bodily needs and wants, and fear shape my attitudes and choices in life.

And to my family, since it might be a while 'til we see each other again. You guys take care of yourselves. Keep the clan tight.  Billy and I will be leaving at dusk today. We're packing up his truck, chillin' out for a little bit, catching an afternoon matinee and maybe something to eat, then we're headed off into the sunset. Well, actually, we'll be going south first, but you get the idea.  It's been incredibly hard to let go. There are so many exciting opportunities ahead of me, and all I can think about is all the things I'm leaving behind. My family, my friends. A girl that treats me much better than I deserve.   It's been emotional and I can't think of anything to say. I miss my friends and I look forward to seeing them. I wish it wasn't going to take three hellacious days of driving to get there, but it's a small matter.  I hope we make it. I hope I can see my friends and shake their hands.

I was chatting with one of my friends from Lebanon when his bad english and my bad english started annoying me. Finally, having decided to put forth some effort in to the situation, I went to Google, the oracle of planet earth, and typed in 'Arabic translation'. First search result was a winner, because it was Google, (p.s. if you type in Bruce Werner in Google I'm number 1, so there you go) and I was brought to an  urlLink Arabic to English and vice-versa online site .  This was a little shocking because I thought the limit of our on-the-fly translation on the web were spanish, french, and german. However I found out that technology has indeed progressed to the point where I can type english, and he can read Arabic. From his conversation, I could tell what I typed was exactly what I got... and he instantly opened up whole paragraphs of conversation in Arabic as if the tower of Babel had never been destroyed and we were all one happy human family.  Which got me thinking...  1) How long will it take writing arabic in an MSN chat window before Aschcroft pays me a visit? 2) How stupid is it to learn a foreign language in 10 years if all our PDAs and phones will be able to instantly translate voice and text? (IBM, good ol' IBM) 3) What type of planet will it be when the language barrier is broken indefintely? 4) Will God, or gods, or various religious wackos who believe in God, fear that with the tower of Babel rebuilt as it were, we are gonna be punished?  Really, to be flip about the incredible experience I had with my Lebanon friend is under-selling the incredible earth changing effect this will have on humanity. It truly is the rebuilding of the Babel tower, in defiance of God's will in myth, and the creation of a human family that will have the barriers broken and open dialogue truly open.   As  urlLink Lambert Dolphin puts it in  his great but ultimately confusing piece on the Tower of Babel:   However, the heart of the matter is made clear in these words, 'let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.' Already a haunting fear had set in. They were conscious already of a disruptive influence in their midst, of a centrifugal force that was pushing them apart so they could not live too closely together and which would ultimately, they feared, scatter them abroad and leave them unknown, unhonored, and unsung, living in isolated communities where they would be exposed to great danger. The fear of this caused them to build a tower and a city. The ultimate motive is expressed in these words, 'let us make a name for ourselves.'   Are we now to 'make a name for ourselves' as a human culture?  Don't think 'we've had that at the UN and in government for hundreds of years'. Because as we all know, the world doesn't change at those places, it is only reflected in those places. The world changes here.. with us.. with millions of people talking and sharing their lives, and wanting to be a part of other lives. It's a remarkable thing what the future will hold for us. If we can talk to and understand Arabs, Indians, and Chinease without the need of them or us to have several years of language education, what would that do? Maybe the Indian who got the telemarketing job that moved from US will tell us on a small chat room how happy he is he can feed his family well... maybe the Arab will discuss how horrible it is to have to be afraid to step out their door or having their hosues demolished in Palastine in an instant messaging window. All of this will reach out where experience is personal and not just some image flashing across the screen of BBC World News.  I know there are unreasonable and warped people in the world, whom you can live just down the street from and whom will always be defensive, combative, and mean. I know there are people who take pleasure in being witty to one's detrement, sharp to increase one's wound, and who will retire with their social group to congradulate themselves. We need not witness or reflect on the mis-understandings and cycle of violence in Isreal and elsewhere to understand how weak un-educated humanity can be, we need only look to our neighbors at times.  However by breaking down one more barrier in our lives, we can more easily hope that shows of amature and childish behavior, of unthoughtful action based mearly on the idea of inflicting wounds, and the tendency to re-inforce positions with un-yeilding hard-headedness and ignorance will be eliminated.  We may still dis-like some of our neighbor's behavior, but at least we can count more of them as such.\n\nText 2:Yeah. Super hot way cool girl thats a friend. Never my super hot girlfriend.

Maybe a joke here or there, but I never took him seriously. Since becoming a Christian I have learned to take satan very seriously. To any Christian, satan is dangerous and something to learn to become very wary of. Satan will always want to get that Christian back into his clutches, to give God a black eye kind of a thing of thing. Satan will always come to Christians and just stand back and watch and wait. He will stand back stalking you, lurking in the shadows. He knows your weakest points and he watches and waits until you are at a weak spot. Then he will pounce on you before you realize what hit you. The attack from Satan to take away God from your life is underway.  Satan also knows your fears. He delights in those fears. A Christian must always be aware of satan. He may withdraw from the field of battle (and a battle it is) for a while, but he will return. He loves to see you in pain.  You as a Christian need to learn to recognize satan. There is no way I can stress this enough. He is the destroyer, and wants to destroy all that is holy and good. He is the master of lies. And he likes nothing better than to remind you over and over and over again of past sins that God has already forgiven you for. God will never torment you with past sins, but satan will with every opportunity available to Him.  Satan will also attempt to lead you to new sins. He wants you to sin. He claps and jumps up and down with glee whenever someone sins. But as a Christian who is also a human, you will sin and there is a way to turn the tables on satan and make him quake with anger and rage when you sin. All you have to do is repent to your God when you sin. Christians that repent make satan blow up into nothing but smoke.  Remember satan is and always will be God\u2019s adversity. And you as a Christian following and loving God, satan will also become your adversity. So study your enemy and learn his ways. Remember he is sneaky, and he lies, and you are with God and God will defeat him. You are now a part of God\u2019s army and you know what?

ERIC Digest.  This is a good summary of the Foxfire approach to teaching.  Although I have never used the Foxfire books, I am familiar with them from my days as a librarian in Appalachia (Reference Desk, Ohio University at Zanesville.)  Many of my patrons loved these books.  I remember they came in handy when a patron wanted information on washtubs as musical instruments!  From the site:  The student-produced 'Foxfire Magazine' and a series of books on Appalachian life and folkways are popular manifestations of an experiential education program originally intended to teach basic English skills to high school freshmen in Appalachian Georgia. The Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning emerged from those classroom experiences. It evolved as a result of efforts to understand and replicate the project's success in helping learners meet curricular mandates (Wigginton, 1989).   Over time, hundreds of teachers have helped develop, edit, and revise Foxfire's 11 core practices to reflect new understandings and lessons learned through implementation. The core practices remain dynamic, and the work begun more than 30 years ago continues to expand and evolve.   This Digest describes the Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning as defined by the core practices, the decision-making framework the approach provides for teachers, and the ways the framework fits with John Dewey's notion of experiential education.\n\nText 2:urlLink USA Presidents  This is an outstanding site which has information on the American Presidency.

Living life as a follower of Christ can be challenging. It can be difficult to hear God\u2019s voice and maintain personal integrity in our fast-paced and ever-changing world.    You aren't meant to do it alone.     We are called to follow Christ in relationship\u2014both with Him and with one another. One way of discovering and cultivating a deep relationship with another person is through a Life Transformation Group.   An LTG is a simple way to develop a vital spiritual walk that allows the Holy Spirit to change your life from the inside out. It\u2019s a simple tool that you\u2019ll find encourages you and leads you into a deeper relationship with God and int an authentic, Biblical friendship with another person.   LTG\u2019s all have the following in common:   They meet once a week for at least an hour.  They include two of three people.  They are gender specific. Men meet with men, women with women.  There is no leader.  There is no workbook or training needed; just people and the Bible.  Each group strives for accountability and mutual confession of sin, regular personal reading of the Bible, and specific prayer.   If you are interested in creating a Life Transformation Group, your first step is to pray about it. Ask God to show you whom you should partner with, and then wait until He tells you. Sometimes that means someone will approach and ask, you to form a group with them. Or, God will lay someone\u2019s name on you heart to approach.&nbsp;   Second, talk the person God reveals to you. Ask if they would be willing to commit to a regular weekly meeting time with you, and if they feel they can be honest with you about their life. You also need to know if those things are true for you. Do you feel as if you can commit to this other person? Can you be honest with them?   Then, set aside a regular time each week to accomplish the following: Talk about your lives. The Bible tells us in Hebrews 10:24,25 that we need each other. We need to develop relationships that are built around mutual honest confession and prayerful support. Use a set of agreed-upon questions to direct your conversation. Starter questions are included below; as your group develops, you may want to adjust the wording of the questions, or include additional questions that pertain to your individual lives. Be accountable for reading the Bible.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;Pray for specific people and problems. Each group member should identify two or three people in their lives to pray for. Write down the names of these people in a place you will refer to\u2014perhaps on a bookmark in your Bible. Each member of the group will pray for everyone on the list by name as they read their Bibles during the week. You are also encouraged to pray for you LTG partner and any challenges he or she might face.   Why Two or Three?    LTG\u2019s are limited to two or three people because the smaller size makes it easier to establish community, practice accountability, maintain confidentiality, schedule regular meeting times, and invite others to join in.  Sample Character Conversation Questions:    Have you been an example this week to the greatness of Jesus Christ in you words and actions?  Have you been exposed to sexually alluring material or allowed your mind to entertain inappropriate sexual thoughts about another person this week?  Have you lacked integrity in your financial dealings or coveted something that does not belong to you?     Have you been honoring, understanding, and generous in your important relationships this week?     Have you damaged another person by your words, either behind their back or face-to-face?    &nbsp;  Have you given into an addictive behavior this week?     Have you continued to remain angry toward another?     Have you secretly wished for another\u2019s misfortune?     Did you finish the reading and hear from God? What are you going to do about it?     Have you been completely honest in answering these questions?    Each group member should also create one personal accountability question tailored to his or her life.         urlLink Read more!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

[This I would say in my dream world.] What's up? [This is what I really said.]  WBE : I'm calling to talk to you about a 'few things.'  Me : OK  WBE : I didn't like how you handled things on Friday.  It's OK that you left early, but I'd like more warning in the future.  Plus, unless it was a medical emergency, according to policy, you are not allowed to use Personal Days as Vacation Days.  Oh, and the client wasn't happy you didn't call her back.  [Side Note: could it be impossible for me to take 4 hours off to visit my sick, dying mother...or to get tests run for a terminal illness...or to fly to Guatemala to save some starving children?  He doesn't know me or my gig.  What a pretentious asshole.]   Me : Well, I apologize if I inconvenienced you.  But to set the record straight, I did get back to the client and answered her question.    WBE : Well, just don't let it happen again.  Me : Sure, whatever.  Hey, I was going to call you later, but now that I have you on the phone, do you have a couple minutes to chat?  WBE : Yes.  Me : I wanted to offer you my resignation.  My last day will be December 3rd.  WBE : [Silence.]  Oh, OK.  And.... scene !  As my coworker Rob said it: 'He attacked you with a squirt gun, and you came right back at him with a bazooka.'  Paybacks are a bitch, friends.  By the way, I was nice enough to go to NYC yesterday to tie up any loose ends.  WBE wasn't there.  Too bad, since I was so ready to tell him he can suck my left tit.   1. List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year.   Finalize a move date. Finalize a New Year's date. (need someone to kiss at midnight, folks.) Finalize a car purchase. Finalize a start date at my new job. Finish the Frank Lloyd Wright cross-stich I've been working on for my mom for Christmas.  Don't hate; I'm crafty.   2. List five people you've lost contact with that you'd like to hear from again.   I agree with Duf, kinda dumb question...  Colleen Shealer (high school friend) Mary Oksas (friend from Holy Name Cathedral choir who had a baby and dropped off the face of the earth) Stoner (now that she doesn't visit PL, I never hear what's happenin'; but did you know she's ENGAGED?)  I can't think of anyone else...I make it a point to stay in touch with the peeps.  It takes effort, and I'm sure I bug people, but someone's gotta make the contact, you know?  From his post below, I'm sure DJS knows what I'm sayin'.   3. List five things you'd like to learn how to do.   Be more patient.  Sew my own clothes. Keep my mouth shut when appropriate. Cure cancer.

List five things you'd do if you won the lottery (no limit).   1) Start a charity that brings orphaned children from 3rd world countries (and eastern Europe and Siberia - where my cousins are from) to the US to connect with families who can't have children, and can't afford to travel and pay the fees to adopt them.  2) Have my own limo driver (it would be my Polish driver Jerry from NY).  Because I'll be very busy spending all my money, he must drive fast without causing harm to other drivers and/or getting a ticket.  3) Give money to my friends who hate their jobs so they can quit and travel around the world with me in my private jet.  4) Buy a different cashmere sweater for every day it is cold.  Cozy  and  stylish!  5) Throw lavish parties for every season for all my friends and family.  And invite U2 to play at each one.   5. List five things you do that help you relax.   Yoga [breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth]. Walking around my neighborhood with no particular place to go. Cleaning while listening to music. Eating mac & cheese while watching a rented movie. Reading a smutty magazine. (i.e. US Weekly, Glamour, or Marie Claire)\n\nText 2:The Fry Fie By DJ 'How Could I Hate Thee?' Shovelpants    1.

Overall, I'm glad I had it and am still great friends with the girl. Turning off love is hard though. As a Scorpio, I often get jealous over future boyfriends which is ridiculous. I think mostly I am sad that I cannot be with her anymore. I won't be able to enjoy the journey anymore. I feel like I'm getting left behind. But even as I write that, I think of how I have my own journey to take up.  I'm a bit torn. I don't want to give her up, but I also want to move on and start up the next relationship. Mainly I want to fill up the hole in my heart. But I don't want to just have a girlfriend that is a patch. No rebounds. I don't want a rebound. I just want an open honest relationship with no baggage.  Then there's the point of, is she easily replaceable? Hell NO! But is there a salve that won't hurt anyone? No. There's the life of the monk, but then she'll feel guilty. There's the life of the party-er, but then I and she will only despise me as a slut. (*would it be easier if I were secretly a jerk that only cared about 1 thing?*)  Anyway, I wish God hadn't made women so irresistible :) But I'm glad he did.

I mean, I really do care.  hehe.  Anyway, I see Kevin's page and it was very angsty.  Apparently he failed his driver's test and was very bummed out about it.  Sometimes I feel like that.  You know, when all of my friends are able to do this the first time and pass and I can't I'll feel that I'm less of a person than they are.  I'm not as awesome or cool as they are since I failed my first time.  And I know how I hate people who just go and say 'Aww, you'll pass next time.'  I damn straight will pass next time.  No, I'm going to fail next time.  Pfft.  Anyway, I decided to comment and I thought about what he wanted to hear at that moment.  Well, I didn't know but I gave a really good attempt.  So I decided to curse him out.  I mean, its different, right?  Basically, I just told him that he will be the same person to me no matter what.  That there are more important things to worry about other than some dumb driver's test.  But I said those two sentences with a bit more energy.  Mixing words like 'asswipe' and 'fuck' a few times.  It was hard, I'm not used to cursing.  Hehe.  Other than that, today was my last day of forensics at La Salle.  I liked working on the electron microscopes.  I do wish the Professor will send pictures he took of the whole event soon.  I could totally post them on my journals.

She said that she had always looked across the street at our house and had always wanted to talk to us.  But she didn't know how.  So she decided to today.  Or tonight.  Wednesday night.  Sure, whynot.  She likes the artchitecture of the house.  And stuff.  Cool, I guess.  A few minutes later, my next door neighbor knocked on our back door and announced that there was a family of skunks living under our shed.  Right.  Well, the next day, we investigated.

What I should have done:  Work on the powerpoint slides of the song lyrics for tomorrow's praise night Make the small group question sheets Prepare the key verses and what will be said between songs Work out technical details for sound and whatnot Make up an icebreaker  How could I preach that Christianity is a way of life, a life of worship, when all I do is try to satisfy my instant urges... to glorify myself?  What happened to 'the life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me?'  What happened to 'I no longer live, but Christ lives in me?'  That's what the theme of the afternoon/night is, that Christianity is life of worship and looking outwards instead of inwards.  Maybe this is all to teach that I'm getting too self-righteous these days?  Trusting too much in what I do?  But that's no excuse for laziness or self-centered hedonism.  Well.  Anyhow, Sprint PCS has been causing trouble, and I don't even have a phone or a number yet.

Here's a rundown of the shenanigans that commenced as soon as Jenny and I left my house: 8:15PM-ish Jenny arrived and we leave. 9PM-ish we arrive at El Campisino in Massillon for alcohol absorbing food (2 cheese enchiladas for me, of which I only ate one.) 10PM we arrive at Jenny's bar selection; Little Country.  She enjoys this bar as they have Karaoke and we were on a skank hunt.  As Jenny said, to find a skank one must go skanky for the night.  This bar sucked ass, please and thank you.  We each had one Zima and decided to leave. 10:45-ish we arrive at Party's bar which is actually called Iron Tales Saloon.  I've known Party for years and met him through my ex-husband.  Party realizes it really  is  me sitting in his bar and comes over to harass me.  He gives me hell for not coming out last summer for his outdoor concerts, and proceeds to get me up to date on all the happenings.  Turns out one of my old friends from those days wound up dying from AIDS.  She started shooting up and caught the virus that way.  I wish I had known she was sick; I could have visited her as she was always very nice to me and never did anything like shooting up around me. Party then proceeds to tell me this was the first Friday in ages that Crypt hadn't been in the bar; he had to work.  I'm supposed to come back when they get back from Daytona (bike week) and see all of the old buddies.  These are all older biker guys and for some reason I'm very comfortable with them.  I would even go into this bar by myself as everyone is really nice, and I know most of the people.  Anyway, Jenny and I were asked to go home with two guys, one guy told me I have nice boobs and another guy told us he would have bought all of our drinks be all of his money was in the bank (yeah, right).  And one other guy told us not to drink all of the Smirnoff Ice as they only had a case left.  LOL  I had quite a list of beverages at Party's; 5 or 6 Smirnoff Ice 2 White Russians 1 shot of Tequila Rose (all they had left) 4 Jello shots (3 watermelon and one orange)  I didn't puke, nor was I hungover on Saturday.  I  was  tired though as I got 2 hours of sleep on Thursday night and I didn't sleep on Friday night.  I caught a nap from 2-4:30PM on Friday afternoon, then I slept from 10PM Saturday night to 9AM today.  Woohoo!    Sorry, off track.  Jenny and I left Party's bar at 2:15AM or so then drove to Taco Bell in Canton South.  We then drove to Jenny's house where her husband made fun of us for about an hour.  We stayed up talking until 5:30AM then they went to bed and I sacked out on the couch.  I couldn't sleep though, because I'd hear a noise and think one of her kids were coming into the living room to poke my eye or something.  Her husband drove me home around noon so he could listen to a noise Jenny's car was making, and I needed to get my tired ass home.  Didn't do shit Saturday night.  Today my Mom and I went to Target, Bed, Bath and Beyond and PetSmart.  Bought new lamps at BB&B and also a new tablecloth/napkins.  I was finally going to buy a fish but the one I really liked was dead.  How nice.  They had no red guinea pigs, so we didn't get one.  Woohoo!  Oh yeah, my sister and nephew came over from PA for the first time since my Dad's funeral in June of 02.  I'm not even getting into that tonight.  K, I'm off.

If you would call me on the phone, I would have absolutely nothing to say. It's true..I's happened several times already this week. Anyway, I really love learning about shit from the days of yore, and I have spent the past few days trying to find 1890's newspaper advertisements about tea and women's culture for a paper. I came across the coolest source, an online archive of Harper's Weekly, an old society-driven newspaper now turned magazine, with some great stuff.    Also, for anyone that likes to drink tea, I highly recommend black ceylon tea flavored with rose. I purchased some from an international market, and it is my new favorite beverage. My box of tea is from Sri Lanka, and I'm not sure if the rose flavor is done often in American-produced teas. I also learned that putting a cinnamon stick in a cup of tea is a nice alternative to using sugar. Ok, I'll stop being 90 years old now.\n\nText 2:I have now lived in Boston for approximately 4 1/2 months.

I just don't understand why people are willing to live in such a climate.  Take a tip from our fine feathered friends: migrate south!

But I feel good.  I have been on a cloud since last Thursday, but I'm not ready to share my details on all that just yet.   The weekend was good; productive and enjoyable.  I got up early (!) on Saturday morning, went to a (free) yoga class and then volunteered at the botanical garden here on Miami Beach.  The yoga was very beginners, but sometimes its good to go back to the beginning.  After more than 4 years of practicing Ashtanga, it was refreshing to be reminded of some of the rudimentary basics of yoga.    The garden project was wonderful.  I forgot my work gloves, so I was digging in the dirt with my bare hands, and there is always something energizing about getting dirt under your finger nails.  My group of about 5 or 6 people was assigned to plant new elephant ear plants in a garden bed.  We just sat on the ground, chatting and planting.  It was great, and I can't wait to go back next month.    Easter Sunday was spent at my mother-in-law's house with my two little divas.  And while the mere mention of mother-in-law sends others shrieking into another room, my mother-in-law is really my family and friend.  She spent the early afternoon alternating between hiding plastic eggs around her apartment for the girls to 'hunt' and 'hunting' for eggs that my little one hid for her to find.  I ate WAY too many jelly beans and York peppermint patties, resulting in a sugar headache that would have made even Candy Genius curl up in the fetal position.  Mmmmm, sugar coma!

This ERIC Digest is in Spanish.  It is a translation of The Limits of Shared Decision-Making.  From the ERIC Digest:  En los anos 80s, una sorprendente vision del futuro de la educacion comenzo a aparecer en las propuestas de reforma: las escuelas operadas por un comite de profesores, sin la irtervencion de un administrador. Mientras pocos profesionales (incluyendo a los maestros) lo consideran como un serio objetivo, la mayoria esta de acuerdo en que los maestros merecen un papel mas importante en la administracion de las escuelas. Desde entonces, las decisiones compartidas (SDM) han llegado a ser una parte muy significativa en los esfuerzos para reformar los colegios. Con el SDM, los maestros son piezas claves para determinar politicas y practicas en las escuelas. La razon es simple: aquellos que estan mas cerca de los estudiantes estan mejor capacitados para tomar decisiones en la educacion. Sus partidiarios dicen que el SDM mejorara la ensenanza del estudiante, creara satisfaccion en los maestros y desarrollara nuevas formas de liderazgo. ?Se cumplen estas promesas? Mientras es prematuro hacer juicios definitivos, estudios tempranos sugieren que el entusiasmo debiera ser templado con realismo.\n\nText 2:I don't really have anything to say, and yet I'm talking{typing} anyway.

It does all so happen my mother was going all day to buy the new furnitures for the appartment, so if i wanted decent stuff, i had to go and select it myself, thing that i did. We shopped for like 6 hours straight. We stopped at a cool restaurant with excellent food. Met  Josee Roberto , teacher at Americana, he will have a meeting with me for english classes (Godamn it).   You probably won't believe it, but i actually studied today! I'm proud of myself, finally something i can achieve! I wish it could be like that everyday!   Also another hard thing to believe, as you probably noticed, the banner has appeared. I'm still trying to remove the google add and maybe restructure, thanks to the help of my comrad  Zyphern .   Spoke a lot with  Mishaga . She is a bit sad, i will do my best to make her smile as much as possible.   Tests tomorrow, i hope to get good grades for a change.

Lest you think Im frivolous, I signed up for the most basic service (less than $10/month) so that I can get decent reception (I cant watch The O.C. in black and white with snow, yo).  I have guilt over all the DVDs I havent gotten around to watching, books I havent read, fresh air I havent had, and I think going without Comedy Central will open up about 17 hours in my week.  Anyway, I spoke with Glen (who was very helpful), and curiosity got the best of me.  I had to ask what the various levels of cable-dom would bring me.  Apparently, there are 3 levels of basic cable (wisely called 1, 2 and 3).  Im getting the first option.  Glen explained what channels are available for each option and when he mentioned Fox News (part of option #3, FYI), he editorialized that, if you like news, thats a really good channel.  Uhhh, thanks Glen, but Im doing just fine without Bill OReilly right now.  Point of the story is this I get nervous around people that are enthusiastic about Fox News.  Its one of my more recent phobias."], "gold_label": 0.0}

What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie?  Why?  Although I really liked 'Rainman' and 'Mission Impossible 2' and especially 'Eyes Wide Shut,' my favorite Tom Cruise movie (drum roll please) is 'The Color of Money' hands down.  By the way, I think Tom Cruise is simultaneously overrated and under-appreciated.  I really liked the movie.  I thought he did a great job, and Paul Newman was at the height of his powers (the much maligned Marty Scorsese was brilliant).    What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie?  Why?  Ocean's Eleven surprised me.  I thought it was pretty darn good, actually.  I also would give props to 'Everyone Says I Love You' and 'Pret-a-Porter.'  But, without a doubt, the best movie Julia Roberts has been in (hands down, nothing else even comes close) is 'The Player.'  Not only is it my second favorite Altman movie, but it is one of my all-time favorites.  It's almost cheating to pick her here because she is barely in it, but... you know the rules!\n\nText 2:Duf, I would never kick you out.   Here at Pandyland, we are free to express ourselves.

It was a great day out minus those cheesy feet and the fact that I too got burnt. But once I got home I slapped on lots of after sun. The train on the way back was funny. LOL. All together now - hehe. Good laughs. Good memories and good memories is what is imporant.  I went to Ash's house last night and we spent 8 hours on the Nintendo playing Bomberman and stuff. Then we watched 4 films one of which was Not Another Teen Movie which is one of the funniest movies ever. It was a good laugh. I have now seen the Ali G film, I wasn't that impressed I have to say. Dirty Danicng is always good to watch and so is The Sixth Sense. So I went down the park today. I was not impressed. I got down there and no one was to be seen so I rang Helen and she said they were in the woods and she would come a find me in a mo seeing as I didn't know where they were. So I sat there and waited. And waited. No one came. So I rang / text again and I was told to 'come and find us, its a game' to which my reply came as 'no, I am not in the mood to piss about'. Still I waited. And you know what I am like when people ignore me or leave me alone so I walked back up the Dobbins and headed home. I met Lora on the way so I turned around and went back as it was a relatively nice day. Sure enough as Lora was there they came out and we sat around all day. Which I didn't mind seeing as I was / am tired. Oh, and its fun to the be the butt of everyones jokes and jibes. Thanks a lot. I miss Jackie.\n\nText 2:Well. What an interesting day.

At least not in the way I want them to.  Last year, whenever I thought of how much I just wanted to escape high school, I thought of TAMS and how next year it would be ok because I would be here.  I get here, and escape my high school, but now find myself wishing sometimes that I had never left.  It's times like those that I think about Boston and how in less than 2 years, I could be living there.  I always look at pictures of the buildings and wonder what it is like to go to college there.    At night, the buildings light up with an array of colors against a black velvet night.  In the morning, there is a blue harbor with a gold ribbon of sunlight reflecting off of it and an orange sky giving a backdrop to the same buildings that were lit up only the night before.  The weather would never be ridiculously hot like it is here.  It would snow in winter.  A lot.  It would be by the water.  I could go out on a Sunfish, sail for an hour, and think about my life.  I could find an underground coffee haus that has guys serenade the place with acoustic tunes every Monday and Wednesday afternoon.  I could wear a sweater every day.  I could get a job at a small shop on the corner of some street and talk to everyone that came in.  I could volunteer at a Children's Hospital and get to individually know each of the kids, and make them feel better about whatever they were in there for.  I could go to all of the east coast concerts and be crazy with other crazy people.  I could find myself a nice east coast guy and finally experience love and all that jazz.  I could have a small group of friends that I did everything with.  We could all know each other better than we know ourselves.  Every Tuesday, after classes, I could go to the local tennis center and play some hardcore tennis in the cool Boston weather.  Thursday evenings I could go to my weekly Yoga class and get in touch with my inner feelings while also getting in shape.  My weekends could be spent with my friends at comedy clubs or with my guy, cuddled up and watching a movie together.  I could finally have a passion for learning and studying.  I could find out what I want to do with my life.  I could spend my night dreaming of Texas and TAMS and all the people that I had to leave behind to go to Boston and feel all nostalgic about it.  I could live in Boston.  But, something tells me that it would be like now.  I would finally get to Boston, and it wouldn't be as perfect as I imagined.  Like here, there would be no guys interested in me.  Classes would be like here.  There would be no small bookshops with weird obscure indie rockers that are obsessed with Tolkien and Douglas Adams.  There would be no coffee hauses with aspiring Jeff Buckleys.  The children's hospital would already have enough volunteers, and a Sunfish would be too expensive for me to buy.  And I would want to go back to where I had left.  But, I wouldn't, because that's not me.    Sometimes, I wonder why I came here, and what it would be like if I hadn't.  I just...I don't know...I am a sap.  I love this place most of the time, but it's like...not what I imagined.  At all.  And I miss everyone so much.  So incredibly much, sometimes, you have no idea.  I miss Arlington and Summit and the tennis team and Kroger and all of my friends.  I miss being third in my class and not feeling mediocre.  But, more than all that, I miss Boston.  And I haven't even been there yet.  So I just tell myself 2 years, Lisa...no, less than 2 years....and you could be living there.  -Lisa\n\nText 2:Wow, today I realized for the first time how much it really does suck that even though I promised myself I would, I haven't remained close to a good majority of my Arlington friends.

Naomi was telling me about orientation and how she met a guy that loves MCS (probably not as much as me haha but oh well) and this other guy that likes good music and she picked them out to be our tadpoles for Frog Night and I started thinking about TAMS and it just blew my mind how it has only been a month since I left for the summer and already it seems so very far away.  It's like...this whole other world...and I dunno...it's just weird.  The life I lead here and the one I lead when I am living up in Denton are two very completely different lives.

Arthur State Historic Sites - www.HistoricVermont.org  Describes the historic childhood home of Chester Arthur in Fairfield, Vermont.   From the site:  While many Americans remember Calvin Coolidge as \u201cthe President from Vermont,\u201d most forget that another of our Chief Executives hailed from the Green Mountain State. Vermont\u2019s \u201cother President\u201d was Chester Alan Arthur. Both Coolidge and Arthur were born in small farming communities and both, as Republican U.S. Vice Presidents, succeeded to the Presidency upon the death of the incumbents. Like many of their contemporaries, both men left their native state to attain political prominence.    Some mystery surrounds the early years of Chester A. Arthur. The most frequently asked question is \u201cWhere was he born?\u201d The President Arthur State Historic Site is a 1953 recreation of the second house in which Arthur lived as an infant. The confusion stems from the fact that Arthur himself told people that his birthyear was 1830 (it was actually 1829). The building in which he was born was actually a primitive cabin hastily erected in the village of Fairfield. The Baptist Congregation later completed the parsonage where the family moved shortly after the birth of the future president. It was this parsonage which was reconstructed by the State of Vermont.  The granite monument, dedicated in 1903, is situated on a small plot of land presented to the State of Vermont by P.B.B. Northrop. At that time it was believed this was the location of the birthplace of Chester Arthur. In 1950 the State of Vermont purchased the land around the monument and the present building was recreated in 1953 using as a guide an old photograph of the house which stood on this site.\n\nText 2:[16999]  Last night the posse and I tried to go to BJs, but it was packed.

Since the lectures are coming to a close, I haven't had to have been in uni since Tuesday. In fact, the only reason I'm here now is that I've been asked to talk to some inspectors about the maths department so I can tell them what I think. After that, the only thing to do is hope that the notes I got through the term are good enough (as you don't expect me to have read any of them yet) and revise like mad.  So, it appears from some government research that one in twenty kids have ADHD, or attention deficit disorder. Now, call me cynical if you like, but in recent years the number of kids diagnosed with this has gone up quite remakably. Now, some may argue that this is because more is understood about the condition by experts and they can treat it better, but it seems to me that at least part of it is that the condition is more understood by  parents  and so they can use it as an excuse not to be able to control their kids. Anyhow, it doesn't really bode well for having 1-2 kids like that in every class you teach. Aargh.  Went out to see the new  urlLink Harry Potter film  yeaterday. Cue groans here. But, evenb though the three main kids are considered slightly annoying (but looking at it dispassionately you can see they are good young actors) the thing that I certainly didn't appreciate is that the rest of the cast are made up of the finest British actors there are, and so each and every one puts in a fantastic performance, making it an exceptional film. I'll probably even go to see the next one.  Also yesterday I bought a few DVDs. I got the  urlLink  Open Range  and Bad Taste. The first is a good story that I saw earlier this year at the cinema. Kevin Costner was born to do westerns and since I'm a bit of a western freak, I loved it. The other is the funniest and grossest film I've ever seen. Words can't describe it. Really.

For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Their conversation appears interesting but they are speaking a language I do not understand.  They are both reputed to be interesting people and so I'm sure their conversation is interesting, but they are speaking a language I understand only a little, so I catch only fragments such as 'I see' and 'on Sunday' and 'unfortunately.'  This man has a good understanding of his subject and says many things about it that are probably interesting in themselves, but I am not interested because the subject does not interest me.  Here is a woman I know coming up to me.  She is very excited, but she is not an interesting woman.  What excites her will not be interesting, it will simply not be interesting.  At a party, a highly nervous man talking fast says many smart things about subjects that do not particularly interest me, such as the restoration of historic houses and in particular the age of wallpaper.  Yet, because he is so smart and because he gives me so much information per minute, I do not get tired of listening to him.  Here is a very handsome English traffic engineer.  The fact that he is so handsome, and so animated, and has such a fine English accent makes it appear, each time he begins to speak, that he is about to say something interesting, but he is never interesting, and he is saying something, yet again, about traffic patterns.        posted by Heather Ann |  urlLink 1:11 PM  urlLink  postCount('107600506142062048');    |  urlLink  postCountTB('107600506142062048');"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Bah, visited the dentist after being being told of a few bad things that an extra tooth behind your original set of tooths might do to you. A little motivation from my eldest bro and I gave up fending for my tooth. Twasn't bad actually, it's just that I hate the first 2 injections. And again, 2? I took 3. The first 2 didnt kill the pain throughoutly. Yes, it feels like ant bite, like my mum said.   Yes, most Malaysians are chickens when they come face to face with a dentist, bothj skilled and unskilled. It's true, I struggled like a chicken waiting to be slaughtered by a butcher. Bad enough, me and my bro had the SAME, I repeat, SAME problem. Except that he had his pest on the right side, and mine on the left. I was called in first. The dentist looked normal enough. He checked my tooth and said the same thing as my mum did. 'The tooth wont do any good if it stays.' Oh boy, did my mouth felt violated or what. Then, he took an x-ray of my tooth to check on it's root. If it's straight, it would be easy and if it's crooked, it's doomsday. Mine was straight by the way and was praying for it to be crooked so that I wont have to remove it. Dont really know about my bro's.  The first injection was the sUx. I felt itchy all over my gum and wanted to scratch. Then, the second injection wasnt so bad. After that, the dentist tried to remove the tooth. He stick something into the side of my tooth and attempted to remove it, hence the pain rushing into the pin-point part. I cried 'Ith hurths, it hurths...' and the dentist said 'Um, you need another injection.' Thats how I ended up with 3 tiny holes in my gum. The tooth came out and I never knew. LOL, was I freaked out to find a bloody tooth beside me. Well, it was worth it and... Yes, my gum's still numb from the injections.

Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?  Amy T.  She lived down the street from me and we went to the same Catholic grade school together.  We were always doing stupid stuff, but what I remember most is riding bikes.  Remember riding bikes ALL THE TIME, when you were little?  That was so great.  I had a yellow banana seat Schwinn.  With a basket.  And we really loved stickers.  I have to admit, that was pretty lame.   2. Are you still in touch with this person?  Unfortunately, not.  When we got to Junior High age, my family moved and we both went to different schools on opposite sides of the city.  We ended up going to the same high school 3 years later, but it definitely wasn't the same.  We both had different friends by then and just ended up saying 'hi' to each other if we saw one another in the hall.  It was kind of sad.  I know she's married now and lives in Wisconsin, so that's cool.  The only reason I know this is because I have a very nosy mother who keeps up with these things...   3. Do you have a current close friend?  In addition to my close friends in Minneapolis, my best friend in Chicago is Ms. T.  She's my partner-in-crime.  We go drinking together, pick up men together, and generally get in trouble together.  She's been in Guatemala for the last 3 weeks on vacation, and I've missed her terribly.  When we're both in town, we don't go a day without talking...at least a couple times.   4. How did you become friends with this person?  We were in a class in Thailand together.  I actually thought she was a ditzy, snob-and-a-half party girl when we were there and didn't really hang out with her.  Not until we got back and took our last MBA class together (and were in the same final business plan group) did we hit it off.  Kind of weird.  Just goes to show how you should give people the benefit of the doubt.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?  Jenny G. from High School.  She was my best friend junior and senior year and really opened my eyes up to different (make that, fun) things.  The first time I got drunk was with her.  We used to go to her house during our lunch hour (she lived across the street) and she'd smoke pot...one weekend we made a trip to Madison for 'Harvest Fest' to hear speeches on legalizing pot or wearing hemp clothing.  (I was very innocent, so this seemed like a huge deal to me.)  Her and her parents (professors) were uber-liberal, opening up my then close-mindedness towards other political and social issues.  She was an all-around cool and interesting person.  I recently e-mailed her out of the blue by getting her e-mail from classmates.com, but haven't followed up with a phone call.  Maybe I'll do that soon...\n\nText 2:Clean-up Friday Five   By Obsessive Compulsive PB   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?    1) Putting my clothes away.  For some reason, the extra effort of hanging stuff on a hanger puts me over the top.  2) The bathroom floor.  It makes me want to gag.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?    Vacuuming is the best because it's minimal effort and makes the place look 10 times better.   3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?    I usually keep things pretty tidy and picked up, but when I know I have guests coming into town for the weekend, the heavy-duty cleaning is done.  It also bugs me if I know I have dishes to do, so that's something that I keep up with.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?    The only way you can truly get a floor clean is on your hands and knees.  Mops carry bacteria and just push the dirt around.  I learned this from my Type A mother.   5. What was the last thing you cleaned?   I made my bed, put away my laundry, and scrubbed my toilet.  I'm going to be out of town this weekend, but for some reason it's always comforting to come home to a clean john.  I'm weird, I know.  Let me just add, the perk of staying in hotels half my life is that I don't have to clean up after myself.  It's so satisfying to be able to use  all  the towels in the bathroom and then just throw them on the floor.  Hell, I can use a towel for each body part and it doesn't even matter!

What a great guy.  The IB kids are done officially, but as the last month creeps on, I've been increasingly loosing interest in everything about school.  It's all fun and games most of the time, but I really don't enjoy being there.  It's not fun, entertaining or anything, I'm not even learning anymore, I'm completely super-saturated with everything that is Turner, and for that, I'll never return... until Tuesday of course =D.    With my new scanner/printer thing, I've really been playing around with it lately, scanning everything that's on my desk just for the hell of it.  So, I'm going to share a rare picture of myself looking as goofy as ever(not like the other 6 million aren't):       Me being absolutely bored, I went and looked back and some of my old yearbooks and stuff and just wondered what all the people I've met are doing these days, because, in about one or two months time, I'll be doing the same thing with the people I met at Turner.    So...  Top Row (starting from the left):  Geoff Smith - He was the heartthrob of Greenbriar, the uber-badass that everyone wanted to be, the guy who didn't know much, but was an advid drinker, smoker, toker, and all the rest.  He was pretty cool, I started to get to know him late in Gr.8 and he wasn't as bad as all the hype lead me to believe, I mean I casted him off as a complete drunkard and loser way prior, and when I started talking to him and playing basketball with him, he wasn't that bad after all, he was just living in the moments.  I think he was the first person to ever offer me a drink/smoke/toke, and I declined all three.  I don't know what would have become of me if I did...  Catherine Chinna - Slavica's good friend, I really doubt they're friends anymore, but I could be wrong... All I remember of her is the fact we called her a Chia Pet and that she broke an entire shelf worth of beakers.  Doug Robinson - The uber-uber-badass, this man failed a grade and still came out on top, we elected him valedictorian(sp?).  He was honestly the most down to earth guy I've ever met.  Funny too.  Middle Row:  Mme. Allibon - She was the attractive teacher, and everyone knew that, she was cool though, and just a fun person to be around.  Anthony (something) - Good guy, super athelete, he was a leader and a great guy.  Blaire (something) - He was an uber-geek, more so than I, but a different kind of geek, like, pop-culture geek sorta thing, I dunno, he was funny, and he had his moments.  Mrs. Robson? - Our guidance counsellor, she had a lot of aspirations and a lot of dreams, and she rested a lot of them on Slavica and us, I think we did a good job for what we did, but sometimes I just wonder if we ever made a difference.  Bottom Row:  The first guy (don't remember his name) - he was a loser.  I can't recall any good qualitiies... all I remember from him is that he showed up at Graduation wearing a t-shirt, shorts and running shoes.  Not even a collared shirt... jesus.  Slavica Stojimirovic - I liked her back then, did stuff, had goals, whatever... I can recall her sucking up a lot though... and she does that today... funny how some people don't change at all.  Danny Dang - Grade 8 was my breakout year, my personality, my self-image everything that I was completely changed.  I was more or less, one of those die-hard, do homework every night super keener kids in Grade 6.  And in Grade 7, I started to like white girls (oddly) and I started to become a little funnier, although still timid and shy in all social situations.  Grade 8... was a defining year, I was still shy and timid, don't get me wrong, but gained a lot of self-confidence and charisma that year... oh grade 8, how I miss you.  I actually cried the last day of school.  I remember it quite well too...  Last day of school had a dance, and as a part of Media Works(tm), Riyaad, Chris Platny, and I were basically 'DJ's' as we ran the AV stuff.  It was fun, it was good, and I had a blast.  I remember cleaning up and packing up all the cables and what not, and school was over like 45 minutes prior but there were still a hell of a lot of kids still around the school...  I was sitting in the office for some reason with Riyaad, and I think Melissa and Alissa walked in, with tears in the their eyes, and I just couldn't help it, but tear up too.  We then proceeded with the hugging, and kissing, and the 'I'm going to miss you... I'll see sometime in the summer..' kinda deal, although we were all really good friends (they called me their sister [another story for another time]), we knew, or at least, I knew, I was never going to seem them again.  We hung out in different social circles, and I really doubted I'd ever seem them ever again.  They really impacted my life, that year anyway, and if I ever knew I was going to die, and needed to write a speech, they'd be included along with the hundreds of other people.  It's my goal to do that... my will will have a letters addressed to everyone who I thought impacted my life in some way, with the simple words 'Thank you.'  Kinda sappy? Most definitely, but I'm sappy guy.  Justine Wilmont - She was honestly, the most out-going, crazy girl I've ever met in my whole life.  Secretly, I had a crush on her for a while, but eh, whatever.  I think I've only liked white girls since that time, I don't ever recall ever actually liking an asian girl ever.  I mean there's hot asian chicks, but seriously, it's not quite the same... Anyway, Justine was funny, and she could carry a conversation until the next day and then some, she has done so many things and will be doing so many things with her life, I was completely astounded.  Shocked even.  She was a cool girl, really cool.  Although, she had some of the worst spelling I've ever seen (*cough her 1 page yearbook entry as reference *cough).  Fun, attractive, outgoing, smart, can't write, what's not to love about her?  ________________  If you're wonder why we're dressed up like retards, it's because we were the inaugural Leadership team for all of Peel I believe.  Our school (to my knowledge at least), was the first school to form a student ran leadership group to address student issues, like bullying, etc, etc... we were called the 'Bee Postive Team' get it? Be? Bee? hahahah!  My brother (who goes to Earnscliffe) is on their version of it, the L-crew, the L stands for Leadership.

The pet store was selling them for 5\u00a2 each. I thought that was odd since they were normally a couple thousand dollars each. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth.  I bought 200.  I like monkeys.  I took my 200 monkeys home.  I have a big car.  I let one of them drive. His name was Sigmund.  He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in their genitals.  I laughed.  Then they punched my genitals.  I stopped laughing.  I herded them into my apartment.  They didn't adapt very well to their new environment.  They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall.  Although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.  Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive: they all died.  No apparent reason.  They all just sort of dropped dead.  Kind odd like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later.  Damn cheap monkeys.  I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my apartment. On the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase.  It looked like I had 200 throw rugs.  I tried to flush one down the toilet.  It didn't work. It got stuck.  Then I had one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead, dry monkeys.  I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals.  That worked for a while.  That is until they began to decompose.  Then it started to smell real bad.  I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I didn't want to call the plumber.  I was embarrassed.  I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them.  Unfortunately, there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time, so I had to change them every 30 seconds.  I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't all go bad.  I tried burning them.  Little did I know my bed was flammable.  I had to extinguish the fire.  Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed.  The odor wasn't improving.  I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys or use the bathroom.  I severely beat one of my monkeys.  I felt better.  I tried throwing them way but the garbage man said that the city wasn't allowed to dispose of charred primates.  I told him that I had a wet one.  He couldn't take that one either.  I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.  I finally arrived at a solution.  I gave them out as Christmas gifts.  My friends didn't know quite what to say.  They pretended that they like them but I could tell they were lying.  Ingrates.  So I punched them in the genitals.  I like monkeys.\n\nText 2:Okay okay okay!&nbsp; So after talking to my mother last night,  I decided once and for all that, YES!

It's so much fun to be able to see and hang out with Josh. He and I have such a fun time being the judgmental people that we are. It's amazing how you can know someone who is the male version of you. The trip so far is going really well. I had a great and safe plane ride. I had to switch planes in Pheonix. It was not too bad as I only had about an hour layover. The weirdest thing happened from Pheonix to Denver though. I was riding in the plane minding my own business when&nbsp;a (very attractive) guy began asking me personal questions like 'How old are you?' and 'Where did you graduate college from?' Well, I answered Vanguard just to find out that he was&nbsp;a youth pastor in the Pheonix area who also is a Vanguard Alum. Isn't the world a small place?!  &nbsp; I got to Denver at around 4:00 (their time) and Josh was covered in paint from doing a job painting earlier in the day. I figured out the airport rather quickly and we came back to Josh's house. It's really nice and totally comfortable to stay in. He has this adorable dog (Winston) who really is the chubbiest and cutest thing I have ever seen. (That was true until he woke me up this morning) HA HA &nbsp; Josh and I went out for dinner at this amazing place that is also in Indiana called Fazzoli's. It's fast food Italian and it's so good. They have unlimited free breadsticks and I always eat baked ziti. It's sooooo good!&nbsp; Josh always knows how I love to eat! Later on we decided to go to a movie with Josh's friend (may I add here that this guy is beautiful) Dan! We went to see Spiderman2 and it was a decent movie except I can't speak for the 10 minutes that I literally slept because I was so tired. Josh ended up waking me up though and I watched the rest. Not a bad movie at all!  &nbsp; Today Josh has to work for a little bit so I am 'Home Alone.' HA HA I decided I would blog rather quickly and log my first day in the beautiful state of Colorado. I am really happy because I was hoping it would rain while I was here. For those of you that don't understand this, it's because it NEVER rains in Southern California and I miss the rain. It rained last night so I was happy and the air smelled so clean! I have no idea what Josh and I are doing tonight other than I am watching him play indoor soccer. You all know (most likely) that I love to watch soccer. It's the socks!  &nbsp; By the way, I should note that I had a special boy call me last night and that was fun. He wanted to know when we could 'see' each other?! I was pretty stoked. Oh well, for today, I am just enjoying quiet, solitude, no drama, and total fun in the land of Josh McCall.

U didn't believe in yourself and how much someone could truly love u. It was just a game to u. Which is why we never moved from square one. Two years we've known each other and nothing happens.

And 4 once this was because of classes. 3 to be exact - Science, Art and PD. Ahhhhh...the joys of a random class...   Science:   1st period, the day started us off with Science. Annie decided 2 not be here and be sick, so she left mel and I up to our own devices! Muhahahaa....... Mel felt like being random and vague, and suggested that she would hate if something she invented was named after her - she decided to tell me the non-existent example of 'John Camera' heheehee, so Mel. Mel also wanted to know what her 'scientific' name was, so here it is: Melanofades, the interesting creature that no-one can tame. We were attempting to finish all these sheets we had 2 do, and Mel was in a random I'm-gonna-write-everything-in-full-sentences-mood, which is realli strange 4 her! So me, being in the hypo mood I was, attacked her so she wouldn't finish the sentence she was writing, Mel then tried to escape and we ended up screaming and chasing each other around the Science lab, while she was still trying to finish the sentence! Where was the teacher? U may ask. Our teacher is sooooooo cool, she is totally used 2 us mucking up so she just kept on going on with the usual buisness of teaching the class while we ran around like lunatics. She's the coolest, u can get away with anything in that class!   PD:   Well good old Mrs. Irwin. She always makes PD, well how can I put it?  Interesting...  She decided she would like to tell us the details of her menstrual cycle when she was 23 and how the travel affected it, it was quite traumatic! (she's about 65 now!) Visual detail we don't need. And she always likes to mention how great sex is - and i quote - 'it's quite exciting actually', 'im not saying you shouldn't have sex, i mean just wait, because it is soooo wonderful when you finally do it' and many other equally scary things coming out of her old granny mouth. Quite hilarious actually, of course, only in hindsight, after you hav got over the shock!   Art:   Art, with Criddy. What more can I say. She makes the class intersting each time. Imagine an old, scary, 'voluptuous' as Han would say, lady who has 2 sons called Bead and Darcy! I mean, shes truly a physco. Once again, Han and I decided to do the physco dance that we did last lesson and ended with her banging her hand down on the table and screaming because we were doing this while she was trying to talk bout the conceptual framwork  (boring!)  So anywayz, we were doing the physco dance again, and she turns around, and says in this really high-pitched voice, 'Turn It Off' (refferring to the radio - which she has sum major thing against) and Han and I once again burst into fits of laughter.

It was soooo good, realli funni!! I suggest every1 see it. Basically everyone was late, T1 told everyone the meeting time was 12.00 and Monty told everyone it was 12.30, which was really good! So half of us were there at 12.00 and waiting around 4 half an hour, and the others were at 12.30. 'Cept Luke and Joel, who were very late, 'cept it was because Joel (silly, silly) left his wallet back at the house and they had 2 go back and get it which took them an extra half-hour. We got food at the food court b4 the movie, and we saw Caitlin Casey and Bubs there, and Caitlin had turned goth and had bought these $430, physco ugly black and fire like combat boot thngs. It was soo crazy!! But yeh, that was basically it. It was bad 2 see that the guys and girls didn't merge and sit next 2 each other, it was basically girls one side, guys otha (and hannah w and gemma were lonered and had 2 sit on two loner seats heaps far away behind us, and so they missed out on heaps of the food, and they were chucking 5 cent coins at us so we could give them food, but it didn't work, and all it acheived was that gemma lost one of her 'prized' 5 cents - haha) so I was the only 1 who sat next 2 a guy. Shame, shame. And back 2 Luke's discussion on the whole hugging issue. No-one hugged goodbye! Well 'cept the girls, but no guys. Shame, shame again. Apart from all those shames it was pretty good.

I dunno if I should put it up, I'm not a sharing my poetry person, cuz it's private, and also people will prob. read into it, tho I spose there is sumthing 2 read into, but kinda not.

I have learned that we are totally at His mercy.  I have learned that reality is totally at God's mercy.  For the past year, after learning wonderful truths in college about 'salvation by God's grace alone, through faith' and 'sanctification by God's grace alone' God decided to show me that it really is by His grace alone.  He showed me that 'no one is righteous, not even one,' including myself, especially myself.   My heart being the rocky and thorny soils, I quickly soaked in these ideals, but as soon as trials came because of these ideals, and as soon as the worries of the world crowded in, I withered.  I crumbled, retreating into myself, as if I hadn't heard the liberating news of the Gospel to begin with.  The great things of God didn't get me excited anymore.  I turned to TV, video games, the Internet, etc. to pass the time.  I shunned my responsibilities.  I saw the weak characteristics that I had grown up seeing:  a terribly weak will, hypersensitivity to my emotional and physical feelings and desires.  Now that I think of it, my weak will stems from being hypersenstivity to my emotional and physical feelings, but that is a differen't topic.  Essentially, when left alone with all the time in the world and the means to do whatever I want,  I spent that time doing things that ultimately served myself, for my personal glory.  And that's when I realized the reality of my situation:  it really is Christ, it really is the Holy Spirit that gives me the desire to know God, because when left alone, I turn away from Him to exalt myself.  I am starting to see the truth of inherited sin:  it is ingrained in my very fibers to take care of myself, to love myself, to make much of myself.  God, I really am at Your mercy.  I don't even know the depths of this phrase enough, but this taste has already shown my heart that more than ever.  I previously responded emotionally and passionately with my mind, but now I respond with a note of defeat and surrender.  All of my responsibilities, all the people that are affected by me, all of my surroundings are at Your mercy.  We are all at Your mercy, God, and that frightens me.  I am out of control of the situation of reality, for You alone are in control.  God, I am at Your mercy, and I fear.  I fear that You will let me keep messing up and turning to myself in my sin so that I can glorify You by being punished for my sin, rather than glorify You by praising You in Your Presence.  I am shaken to the core...\n\nText 2:urlLink http://www.betterlucktomorrow.com/   For you folks in New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco, check it out early April.  It's a film by Asian Americans.

Everyone arrive at 6:00. We'll eat pizza (by the way my parents won't be home for some of the time, that does not mean that drinking or other badnesses are allowed) I'm hoping to finish season one of Sports Night. That is my goal, however if you are all bored, we can do other stuff. People need to bring snacks. Erin (if she comes) and Sophia will leave by 11:00 (at my parents behest) and we'll...do stuff. The Comstocks are coming around 9:00 so we'll watch Joan of Arcadia then.  Now I know that Erin, Thomas, Sophia and Nathan are unfamiliar with Sports Night so I have compiled a quickie 'previously on' segment  Previously on Sports Night: Casey and Dan were Anchors, Dana was Producer, Natalie was Executive Producer, Issac was managing editor, Jeremy was...something else, Sally was the skanky ho who ran the 2:00 update. Here's where it gets complicated...Casey loves Dana, who is in love with Gordon. Natalie is hellbent on getting Dana and Casey together, however Dana is uninterested because she doesn't think that Casey is really interested in her. Natalie liked Jeremy and they were really cute together. Natalie got sexually assualted by a football player and the crew worried about the fallout, which never came.  Now I also know that Jonah, Nathan, Sophia, and Thomas are unfamiliar with Joan of Arcadia so I have compiled another 'previously on' segment here  Previously on Joan of Arcadia: The Girardi family picked up and moved to the titular town of Arcadia, Maryland. Joan talked to God, who appeared to Joan in different (and frequently hilarious) forms, befriended Adam, an artist, and Grace, the militant...I don't know how else to describe her. The dad, Will, was a police chief, the mom, Helen, was a secretary at the school. The older brother, Kevin, was a baseball player who was injured in a car accident resulting in his being in a wheelchair. The Youngest child, Luke is a geeky kid who really reminds me of the Comstocks. Adam's Mom had died. God told Joan to do random stuff, which would benefit somebody in someway (a friend, a child, a teacher etc...) One of these things was to keep one of Adam's (the Artist's) sculptures out of the school art fair, she had a 'failure of imaginiation' and ended up smashing the sculpture with a chair. This worked out badly, as Adam came in just as she did this. So Adam and Joan had a falling out. Eventually Joan and Adam made up after Helen befriended Adam and Grace Helen and Joan intervened and helped Adam read his mom's suicide note, which was pleasant and left good ripples. So Adam and Joan kissed and the world went 'SQUEE!'. Also Grace and Luke kissed at a dance then worked together on the science fair, leading to a really cool Goldbergian sequence of events that lead to the previously mentioned kissing. So they're kind of together. Kevin got a job at a newspaper which lead to him making out with his boss, Rebecca (who is Sydney Poitier's daughter). Will discovered massive corruption at the city level and squealed to the FBI which lead to the dissolution (I think that's a word) of the Police Department. So now he's a Detective and the man who provided the information is the new police chief. Whew!  Come at Six, Girls leave at Eleven, Guys leave whenever the next day.

I believe that in life we can learn to forgo a lot of small things that we make into big things un-necessarily by learning and repeating these three words 'It Doesn't Matter', meaning that in the face of our larger lives this particular thing 'does not matter'.  I believe that every second of our life, every person, every animate and in-animate object that crosses our path is a gift that we can choose to leave behind or carry with us always in the un-ending treasure-trove of our brains and hearts and souls.

What are you taking about and how come no one seems to blog at the moment?\n\nText 2:Last night, I attended a party with people from work and some other friends. We were celebrating the opening of the May 2-4 long weekend (Victoria Day). It can be a bit problematic when you start drinking at 4 pm. In the end I think we all had a good time.  About half way through the night, I was standing in the kitchen making a drink (surprise, surprise). We started talking about traveling, and one co-worker who is becoming a citizen brought up an interesting issue. He has lived in many places, some where wars have happened, and his point was this: you don't realize how important or precious your life is unless it's in danger. People who live in countries where they know their life could be taken away within minutes are far more serious about life, they treasure it.   Here, in Canada, we are so easy going and laid back because we have nothing to fear (or so most of us think). I think this also makes us a bit complacent about life. We get wound up in trivial issues like what do I wear today, what diet should I be on, or which car should I drive. If only some of us could see other places, and experience the life of someone who treasures it, maybe our opinions on multi-culturalism and the importance of our own lives would change.   There always has to be a balance though. Even though we may be a bit complacent, because our lives are not in danger we are more laid back and we don't care what place someone else is from, or what religion they are, or what colour of skin they have. As long as everyone had a drink in their hand, and someone to chat with, we were all fine."], "gold_label": 0.0}

So we high step it on over to the United Artists theatre. (btw - Nicest theatre ever. Huge screen, billion stadium seats, cushy cushy rocking chairs, padded armrests. Well worth the $8.50 for the experience of a nice theatre, with nice people for once)   Hmm, what to see... Mean Girls...no! 13 Going on 30?... NO! Van Helsing...eh...heard it wasnt so good, soooo no. Oh wait! What is that playing on 3 of the fricken 9 screens?   'TROY'   (I can hear the whipping noises now) It wasn't that bad, if 2.5 hours of a bare-chested Brad Pitt is not bad to you. To me, however, I saw this film the first time, when it was called 'Gladiator'. The story was ok, Brad Pitt-Anniston played 'Achilles' (I'll give a shiny penny to whomever guesses his weakness) and Eric 'Hulk' Bana plays his nemises 'Hector', the big brother Trojan to wussy little 'Paris' played by Orlando 'Elf-boy' Bloom. The fight scenes were cool, but i think that BP only knows one move. I saw him use it at least 5 times in one fight. Lots of killing Braveheart/LOTR battle style, but really nothing new here.   I would rate it as 'DVD Rental', which falls between the 'See it in Theatres' and 'Wait till HBO' and way above the 'See it on Network Television'. If you must require stars that equals *** (***1/2 if you like Brad Pitt's sweaty, bloody, naked chest).  One cool thing they did was have a pre-show that was essentially commercials for upcoming tv shows and movies, but it was better than those stupid slideshow ads. There was also a longer trailer for 'The Day After Tomorrow' that I hadn't seen yet. Mmmm disaster movies, I just wanna see that one for the FX, and to see how Spiderman saves the World when Mother Nature is the Enemy.\n\nText 2:i may have had a breakthrough tonight  i sat down to play some .50/1.00 hold 'em tonight.  for the last several weeks, i've stuck to a very strict game plan:  only play the top few hands.  let's examine that.  in texas hold 'em, you are dealt 2 cards.  i play the following hands: AA,KK,QQ,AK,JJ,10s,9s,8s,7s,6s,5s,4s,3s,2s. that's 14 hands which can be generated 94 ways (13 pairs which occur 6 ways, and AK which occurs 16 ways) in a 52 card deck, given two cards, there are 1326 possibilities (52 C 2) that means i play about 7% of the time. 'Isn't that boring?' well, to me, no.  cause when you catch one of those hands, you're fairly confident that someone is going to get smashed, and that you're going to do the smashing.  also, i enjoy the following activities:  1) computer progamming 2) math 3) making my own t-shirts  so playing 7 of 100 hands really doesn't faze me.  anyway, tonight, something happened.  i played computer-like for a bit.  but then i analyzed the table and discovered something:  these people were playing tight, just like myself.  so i changed up and started playing aggressively.  i made moves and stole pots with nothing.  i was in when i should have been, and out when i should have been.   i stole blinds, i pushed people around, and more importantly, i won.  a lot.  i was up 20 big bets in about 20 minutes.  it was the first time i really read a situation and responded.  i left that table because i pushed the last guy all in and won.  there was no one left when i left.  it was radical.  i think i may be on to something here ...  current stats:  $180 after a $100 buy-in and a $25 gift"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Now listening to  Social Distortion's   Mommy's Little Monster  (1983).  Some comments friends made on the  Last Samurai  casting call.  Crystal : um.. im sure for amistaad's after party.. the servers didnt wear shakles and call everyone 'massah'   Nick:  Damn, that is both patriarchal and economically exploitative.  still, it's comforting to know that in 'ancient Japan, circa 1870's', there were only 'beautiful women' Some further thoughts on the issue. Yes, as my brother pointed out, Tom Cruise is a white guy who goes to Japan during the era of the Meiji Restoration to teach the Japanese how to be western. This is something that really did happen and it is cited as one of the reasons why Japan was able to become a regional power by the 20th century. However, the previews for the film show Cruise being captured and joining the samurai, in a time when the samurai warrior class is abolished. However, the question is if he somehow becomes the savior of Japanese tradition.  Furthermore, many of the issues I bring up are directed toward the casting call. Not necessary the movie, since I haven't seen it (yet?)  Today I baked myself two cookies for breakfast. They turned out quite nicely. Did laundry. Got books in the mail and a letter from Julia. Then I did some note taking from the Mezias and Boyle book, because it was over due. Then I went to campus and mailed some stuff, returned books, and did some photocopying. Chatted with some folks, and it looks like I'll probably hang out with them on Wed.  Now listening to  Social Distortion's   Prison Bound  (1988).  In other news, there was apparently another attack on US troops in Iraq, but what was different about this was it was reminiscent of Rwanda in 1993. That's pretty fucked up and it suggests how bad it is in Iraq right now for the people. It often requires conditions that are absolutely abhorrent before people lose it. Look at the American Draft Riots during the Civil War, the Watts Riot of 1965, and the LA Riots of 1991. There were desperatly poor people with nothing to lose, and they got fed up. I can only imagine things getting worse, before they get better.  Something that crossed my mind recently is if all one knew of me is what they read on this blog, what would their impression be of me? This thought is somewhat inspired by my reading / writing for 616. It could be said that just using my blog as the only source of figuring me out wouldn't produce a very 'thick' description as Geertz calls it.  ***\n\nText 2:[15488]  Today I went out to find a nice suit to wear for my cousin's wedding next week. One of the things I hate most is shopping for clothes. I don't mind when I've gone shopping with ex girlfriends or even when I accidentally get dragged into by female friends. However, when I have to do it myself... it just makes me feel fucking uncomfortable.  Here are some reasons why: 1) Realizing that I too am materialistic and superficial. Clothing is and has been one of the most basic things that delineate social class. Like Roman robes! I'm buying into the motherfucking capitalist system! Shit I even looked around South Coast Plaza for something! 2) Dealing with sales people. Fuck I want them to just leave me alone. 3) The time consuming aspect of finding something that fits and looks good. The thing with nice clothes is that they have to fit to look good. The biggest problem with my build is that I have pretty wide shoulders given the build of the rest of my body.  When I was going through suits it took forever to find something that fit me decently. 4) Spending money on something superfluous. 5) Parking at malls suck. Anyway.. I have a nice new suit after hours of work. I don't feel fulfilled though.  I should perhaps nap for a while.  **"], "gold_label": 1.0}

There has to be a kick, an explosion, a boob, a fantastic line, a  something  in every minute or the audience might become bored and go to the multi-million dollar action extravaganza instead.  Jackie Brown from one of our more explosive action directors, gives proof of Tarantinos versatility.  The opening moment, with Jackie on the moving walkway, I loved for three reasons (and we part company here, so there really isnt much point is going too much further):  1.  It sets up a very deliberate pace that Tarantino carries through the entire film (including the scene at the department store where pace is everything).  2.  It compels you to sympathize with this middle-aged black woman who works for a crap airline and makes a crap wage and has to hustle to make the rents.  In the same opening, when she starts to run so that she wont be late for work, I thought, man, when Im in my late 40s, I pray to God Im not a clock puncher who had to run to avoid being late for work.  3.  It pays homage (oh Tarantino and the homage) to all the Blaxploitation films that gave Pam Grier her fame.    4.  Okay, one more thing, the song in the background, Bobby Womacks Across 110th Street, thats the jam right there, son.  Thats the jam.  Also, the words are trying to tell you something.  I could go on and on about Jackie Brown, but I wont.  Suffice it to say that of his movies, it is by far the most  believable  to me.  I believe there are people like Jackie just trying to survive in Bushs America (oops, sorry for the slipmy beret got in my eyes while I was typing).  And Pam Grier, in my view, was absolutely dogged by the awards.  Her performance was off the hook (so was Robert Forsters).  I think that when the pace is a bit slower, it is easier to appreciate the acting, and this film is about controlled pace and controlled acting, both of which were handled extremely well by experts.

So in addition to my new ones, I can still keep and use my old (current) ones. Always one to hunt out cute clothes or accesories at bargain prices, I gave Wal-Mart's Vision Center a try. After all, I did get my current ones there (as for my first pair almost 7 years ago, I don't remember how I got them, except for the underlying 'mo in me didn't say 'NO FOOL! They're ugly and big and don't match your face!'... 2 years later I corrected the issue. And today I got myself 2 new pairs. The first are normal glasses. The frames are black, and thicker than the wire ones I have now, and only surround half the lens. This picture either is or is 99% the frame I chose:       The other frame is for my new prescription sunglasses, since I'll be driving and such.

They were not great musicians.  Like many bands of that era, they were inspired by the punk movement, and by the belief that  you did not have to be a virtuoso musician to form a rock band . But unlike many of the punk bands, U2 were not nihilists; they didnt want to destroy the world. They were optimistic, they were honest, and they were passionate about rock and roll. In many ways they were the perfect blend of the punk bands like the Clash and the great rock stars of the Sixties, like Bob Dylan and John Lennon.

So, yesterday after Jimmy Choi polished off his 50th wing at Bill Bateman's, we returned and hung out at our place.  After some time, he started jamming on my guitar... and yes, one thing led to another, and we started to record some more songs.  2 were instrumentals that I recorded to MD, but unfortunately I erased them by accident later that night.  We then recorded 'So We Come,' complete with an overdub guitar solo. it was great.  Anyhow, class today was uneventful and I ended up either studying at the library (which I will be doing again soon) and going to office hours.  It's still a struggle for me to get myself working at times, but God is always 'providing a way out so that I can stand up to' the temptation of laziness.  It's pretty interesting how He does it... like, today, I took a nap, which I was ok.  Earlier on, I was praying that He'd help me study more efficiently, but when it was time wake from the power nap, I of course didn't want to wake up.  I napped for an extra hour, even though my alarm kept going off every 20 minutes.  My reasoning kept getting worse and worse (I need more sleep, I'll study better later because it'll be more efficient, etc.) until finally, the alarm in our fire escape went off.  Yeah, I couldn't turn that off, and that's when I realized, 'Argh. I have no reason to be sleeping so much.'  Well, God sure provided a way out, regardless of how I felt, and it was definitely for my good.  Thanks God. Yet again, You've shown how you answer prayer when I least expect You to, but always when I really need it.  Ok, off to the library now to resume studying for the P.D.E midterm tomorrow.\n\nText 2:Up until the moment I went up to speak, I kept thinking, 'Even with all this preparation, it feels like I have no idea what I'm going to say.'  But, it's over now.  That night really drained me; I notice that whenever I do this sort of thing, all of my energy is sapped out afterwards.  I'm still trying to recover.  But, enough about me.  Every day of working with the children and teens in my church is always a big lesson about how God is working with us.  They don't understand why they have to do certain tasks or be nice or etc., just like we don't understand why we have to be in our respective jobs or places in life.  This is an under-developed thought, sorry.  Estoy muy cansado.  (I'm very tired).  ****  Biochem exam is in two days.  So, I'm here in the College Ave. library, 8:40 PM on a Sunday night, about to start studying for it.  But my eyes are already drooping, I know that within 20 minutes I'll be falling asleep. :-)  ****  I'm still thinking about 'Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.'  The strangest thing has been happening the past two days: the pain isn't there any more.  It just stopped.  I'm not so sure why God brought this about, maybe so that I can get focused with yesterday's speaking engagement.  However, it's starting to creep back in again.  I'm still determined to resist and not let it control me, but it's strange how these feelings have a life of their own.  ****  Kids go through a lot, and they have such strange, complicated social lives.  At least, the ones in my church do.  I'm hoping that they can really get the Gospel, and learn how it can help them start demonstrating more care for each other.  These kids have such a large capacity for it, if only they can see that.  I'm starting to see the real difference it makes when parents try their best to raise kids with Godly principles.  Those kids tend to be a lot more caring and humble and obedient.  They're not perfect, but they're definitely a lot easier to work with, a lot more pure and trustworthy at heart.  ****  It humiliates me more that as I see what kind of person I am.  I'm really not that rational, not nearly as rational as I had hoped/perceived/projected/wanted myself to be.  How shameful it is to see the reality that one is controlled more by one's emotions.  How can this change?  Or do I accept things the way they are... then see me go through life as if it's a constant roller coaster?  See me handing everything in late, doing things last minute, because I can't have the will to keep saying 'no' to what I feel like doing at the moment?"], "gold_label": 0.0}

I cut some up for lunch and my hands still smell like it. In the bathroom we have a little whale-shaped soap-pump, and that soap smells like tea to me. I'm always thirsty when I smell the soap, but that smell doesn't hang around. I don't end up drinking much tea.  I'm sick of that little cat waking me up at 5:30 every day. I'm exhausted. I got a grown cat about three months ago, and I've never had a cat before. Never particularly cared for cats, either. It was my darling roommate's idea, and now she wants a new cat because this one likes me better than her. Oh, and she told her mother that the cat is mine and only mine. That's not the truth. Anyway, outside our house there is some chopped wood dyed red around the porch. My father used to work in a wood chippery making mulch. I don't think he'd find this stuff quality. So, when we track these wood chips in, the cat likes to attach them and try to eat them. She always pounces on them, chews for a bit, then spits them out and starts over. I think she deserves to get a splinter in her gum.  Oh, Jessie called me last night to tell me about Adam. He's a millionaire! This was news to both of us, but when I went out to tell Kara (mind you, I had to put on clothes to do this...) she already knew. She didn't think she needed to tell me, and dismissed what I had to say even as I was trying to be friendly. God, if it doesn't involve abused animals or Harry Potter I better not mention it to her. Anyway, I am really looking forward to tomorrow night and just hope we don't fight any more.\n\nText 2:Friday, got some shocking news thru email at 4.32pm. Twas time for sms-frenzy though the news's not certain yet. Had some home-cooked meal at my sis's place comprising of 'Ketam Masak Lada Hitam' and 'Sotong Masak Hitam' (tak baik makan sedara Berudu!). Yum! Went to Bukit Bintang for a while and then to the ever popular if-you-think-you've-got-class-don't-drink-here-go-to-Starbucks-and-you'd-smell-like-Maggee-assam-laksa-even-after-dabbing-yourself-with-lots-of-perfume Selera Kampung to meet some guys. Nizam's really into his new bf and was thinking of finding a job in East Malaysia or Brunei. He'll be having some 'tea-ceremony' soon to present himself to the parents. Went home bout 2am but had a short nap at Mobil station near Sg Besi after a heavy downpour. Was planning to have McDonald's prawn burger, coz one of the staff who's working there is kinda cute (read: chubs in uniforms) but the place closed at 12. I've to make up the theory that McDonald's trying to make people eat more hamburgers thru&nbsp;making their staff wear tight shirts and pants, give killer smiles while mopping the floor, bending over all over the place. I wonder if they're supposed to make fries wearing aprons, only...   Saturday, had a haircut (coz I was planning to take some passport-sized photos) and went to cc at Bangi to chat with Harry. He gave a lot of pointers, and said that I could dump my stuff over at his place if I've no where to put 'em, and that'd be a lot. The cc is run by a family whose family members and friends are mostly chubs, including one twin chubs. It did cross my mind that i got there subconsciously thru the concentrated smell of fat. Like some say, the sense of smell is the most primitive sense and most developed of all our senses. Really?   Went to Sri Petaling at 8 and hitched a ride with Hard, Fairy and JD to watch Akademi Fantasia. Got there about 8.30, after a Subaru WRC drive featuring Hard, and co-piloted by Fairy. Such display of enthusiasm for Kaer made me feel touched. With a flick of his hair while waving his invincible pass a-la  'diva datang lambat' , Fairy got us thru the gate. Picked our seats on forth row. The crowd was full, but disciplined and full of enthusiasm. Everyone seems to know everyone else in those front rows. I sat quietly, sandwiched between 2 chubs. Ahh....  The stage looked smaller than what I see on tv, and so did all the contestants. Aznil was hilarious, the show was ok, I like Kaer's Episod Cinta Dari Bromley but especially their final broadway-ish show Cats' Memory. Many gave them standing ovation, including  urlLink Joe , Hard, and Fairy, and yeah, they very well deserved it. The result was revealed, and Zarina was out. There was shock, and anger. Not many cried, perhaps becoz they're more angry than sad. She's cool. I always thought of her as someone who'll be in the Top 5 final. Sounds like the Top 5 would be 'Nurul, Mas, Farah, Adam, Bob'... hahahahaha. Btw, I'm eagerly waiting for Bob to appear in full  Nike  attire on tv. Any chance of that happening?   Went to Kak Ara to have dinner. More complaints about the result. Everyone complaint to everyone else via sms 'Why Zarina?'. Joe was especially pissed, and now he'd be more considering Nikki of Malaysian Idol didn't pull thru. Btw, Happy Belated Birthday, Joe!   Left for Kelana Jaya, something we all haven't done for a very long time. The mood and surrounding do have an effect over everyone else; the feeling of thrill, suspense, diva-esque made people walk slowly, with a 'lenggang' and smile. JD suddenly had a barrage of questions to everyone, questions that I believe I've asked myself about 10-12 years ago. 'Why did u become one? Are you happy? What type are you looking for? Is it all about sex? Do you choose this life? Do you want to change? Why and why not? Are you t/b/v?' And so on... To JD, pick your path carefully, young man. It'll be hard to turn back. Hard said I passed the scoring marks in answering JD's questions... Yeay!&nbsp; Btw, this para requires a lot explanation which I MIGHT do should I have the time later...  Sunday, Eric called and wanted me to tag along to show his friend around Putrajaya. Went to Souq to have 'Briyani Gam Batu Pahat', which is much better than the one at 'Pintu Gerbang Kg Baru' or the inconsistent-standard near Uniten. They took some pics of the bridge (Jambatan Wawasan), Istana Darul Ehsan, Perdana Putra Building and Ministry of Finance. Eric looked exceptionally happy, smiling and showing his teeth, which tells me that he had a very wonderful nite. Btw, our usual plan to have Baskin-Robbins every 31st of the month (31% off on every 31st of the month) has to be cancelled.   Went to Sri Petaling again to hitch a ride with Hard and Fairy, and off to Plaza Ampang for a karaoke session. Ajip was already there, and Teddy, Cipan and fren, Mike and Shah, and JD came by later. Those who planned to sing a lot of songs decided to sit quietly after listening to Ajip and Fairy, including yours truly. Twas a free flow of songs incl Jangan Bersedih Lagi (Shah), Tekad (Teddy &amp; Hard), Hanya Memuji (Ajip &amp; Fairy), Episod Cinta Dari Bromley (Fairy's tribute to Kaer), Nirmala (Ajip), U Got It Bad (Teddy), Unchained Melody (Hard) and a lot more. But I did try a few verse from Barbara Streisand's Memory, inspired after the AF concert.&nbsp; Come to think of it, most songs were inspired by AF, with Fairy gave extra attention to Kaer's songs...  The five of us (Hard, Fairy, Ajip, JD, me) had dinner at Kg Baru, ordering quite a lot of things, while still complaining about yesterday's AF result. Ever the 'kipas susah-mati'. JD was back to his usual 2-words-per-hour mode. The karaoke and dinner was sponsored by Ajip (thx!), who looked none to happy with his new glasses, and planned for colorful contact lenses. Excuses? Definitely.... heheh   Monday, still listening to Barbara Streisand's Memory."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Oh, it a great play, and I like the movie with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton too. Albee is a genius.  It is perhaps his finest work.  What?  Oh...   2. What's your favorite movie line?    First I have to say that when I read Panda's blog and found out that she was in high school when  Single White Female  came out, and then I thought of where I was at that same time, I felt as old as the hills.  Pause for bone creak, take Geritol.  My favorite movie quote comes from the Woody Allen movie  Crimes and Misdemeanors . One subplot of the movie is that Clifford Stern (the Woody Allen character) is making a substantive documentary that he hopes to sell to PBS featuring a minor philosopher, Professor Levy, who has amazingly profound insights on life (but ends up killing himself, natch).  At one point, the professor says:  'We're all faced throughout our lives with agonizing decisions, moral choices. Some are on a grand scale, most of these choices are on lesser points.  But we define ourselves by the choices we have made.  We are, in fact, the sum total of our choices.  Events unfold so unpredictably, so unfairly.  Human happiness does not seem to be included in the design of creation. It is only we, with our capacity to love that give meaning to the indifferent universe. And yet, most human beings seem to have the ability to keep trying and even try to find joy from simple things, like their family, their work, and from the hope that future generations might understand more.'  With a nod to imdb.   3. What's your favorite line from a song?    I literally could pick at least 100.  There are so many lines from so many artists and so many songs.  I will pick a few:  From Wilco's 'Reservations':  ...I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say How can I get closer and be further away From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie  I've got reservations about so many things but not about you...  From Bruce Springsteen's 'Ghost of Tom Joad':  ...The highway is alive tonight.   But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes.   I'm sittin' downhere in the campfire light  with the ghost of old Tom Joad...  From Atmosphere's (a.k.a. MC Slug) 'Shhh' (which is an ode to Minneapolis):  ...got trees and vegetation in the city I stay The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space The women outnumber the men two to one Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day And the jobs ain't really too hard to find In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme...    4. What makes a wedding fun and memorable? (good luck, DJS!)   Play 'Summer Nights' and 'Brick House' all you want:  never, ever, ever play 'I Knew the Bride when She Used to Rock and Roll' and don't ever, ever, ever, ever play a Meatloaf song.  Ever.  I have been to weddings that cost $500, and I have been to weddings that cost $500,000.  For me, what makes a wedding more than anything else, more than the reception, the food, the dress, the DJ, the band, the amount of booze, the fact that the party went on and on until the break of dawn is that there is some moment during the ceremony when the love that the couple feels for each other overwhelms the room.  If that tender moment is present, and it is sincere and palpable, then the wedding, to me, is both fun and memorable.    5. What do you daydream about?    Lots of things.  Golf, travel, writing and ideas, my daughter, my wife, food, friends, co-workers, violence, art, sport, but mostly sex.  If I am being totally honest, then I would admit that I daydream about sex a lot.  In fact, my mind is starting to wander now..."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Its a very interesting book indeed and I've loved everything in there.  Its quite eye-opening too if you read between the lines.

They are set at a disadvantage in our curriculums much of the time, because they're learning to read in a language that they don't necessarily know yet, so not only do they have the modern distractions of TV to convince them that reading is boring, it's also much more difficult than it is for English-speaking kids.  So, their teachers set a challenge: read 100 books and we'll have a party and invite someone famous to come read books to you.  They did it, and guess who came over?  None other than  urlLink Robert Munsch !  He stayed over with one of the kids' families the night before, had a barbeque with them and invited people over, got together with a bunch of kids in the morning and wrote stories with and about them, and then they did two sets of readings.  There are 500 kids in the school and parents were invited too, so they went in shifts of 250 kids.  What's the first clip they played from him? 'MORTIMER!!!!!!' ( urlLink hear it! )  That's especially excellent, because when  I  was little, Robert Munsch came to  my  school and read that story to us and it was great.  Oh Robert Munsch.  I heart him.  He wrote two of my favourite books of all time:  urlLink The Paper Bag Princess , and I Love You Forever ( urlLink listen to him read it! ).        posted by Heather Ann |  urlLink 8:08 AM  urlLink  postCount('108678351751147630');    |  urlLink  postCountTB('108678351751147630');\n\nText 2:Happy Canada Day everyone!

I mean...there was a time when I thought Titanic was the greatest American film ever made.  Changed my life.  Then it made all that money, and boy did *that* change my tune!  And how about Gladiator?  My god, what a masterpiece!  Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.  Dance too close to media saturation, and you get burned.  A lesson for artists everywhere.\n\nText 2:My thought exactly.

Right now I am dog sitting for Rebel and I guess Hamster sitting. I get to stay at the house for a week and it kind of feels like it is my own. Gets me thinking about when the time will come for me to really move out and what that will be like. Mom calls almost every hour now so when I am on my one does that mean she will call more? I know they just miss me and want to see how I'm doing. It's all good I don't mind as much now as I did when I was a teenager. That sounds funny, like I'm ancient or something. BABUSHCA! hee hee. Trevor said to me the other day, Cela your 24 so how come your not married? He hasn't found me yet. I thought it was a good answer.  So I bought a dance video that has all the Latin Dances that I've always wanted to learn on it. Rhumba, Cha-Cha, Argentina Tango, Merengue, and some other ones that I don't remember right now. I am so excited though because the dances aren't as hard as I thought they would be. The only bad part is that I don't have a partner so it looks kind of funny dancing a couple dance by myself. But it is so much fun and I love every minute of it. When we went cosmic bowling with the youth on Friday the music there was getting everyone in a dancing mood even Hannah! Yep she was getting her groove on. It was fun watching Z-Diddy, Andrew, John and Steve dance. It was a great time of course I couldn't help moving my feet you get carried away when there is music! I could of danced all night, I could of danced all night, and still have danced some more......\n\nText 2:'Moral: The pathetic thing that just gets in the way of everything.'

Morals are something that should be so deeply engrained into your skull that you dont even think about them. And this is only if you have any in the first place.

I am fine by myself. Maybe it's because I never had anyone here anyways..but I dont really think that would matter. As a basic human instinct you react for yourself...by yourself.  Not have to be right there with your hand being held. I think thats something that has done almost totally away with the human race today. And thats a very sad thing.   I need to go think somemore about a few controversial topics. I will write later. I still need another episode of Brendan Leonard.  I have to go. People cant survive without me."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I just have to work very hard for a few more days, then I can coast for a while...  After skipping two days of any semblance of schoolwork, I wrote a paper and translated 100 lines yesterday. If you don't have a feel for what it's like for someone at my level to translate, 100 lines is a  lot  (a week's worth, in fact, and it's impressive to do it in one day). So I went to class more or less confident, and that confidence shook when the teacher said, 'yeah, Wednesday we got through a lot!' I heard him say, 'without Jessica, we had a really successful class!' Don't worry, by the end of the story, it'll be fine. Things get worse, because I had thought I'd done really well working ahead and would be prepared no matter what the assignment turned out to be, but his assignment had skipped around. So I was incredibly nervous waiting my turn, and with only three of us in class, everyone always has a turn to translate. Well, perhaps he glanced at me and saw me hyperventilating, but something happened and only the other two translated. After the first woman did about 7 lines, the other woman did the rest of the paragraph -- more than her fair share -- and we ran out of class time. Yes! This teacher is a really good guy. Not too easy, but a stand-up human being. He can tell when he's freaked me out, and he's willing to work with me, not against me.  What else made this day great? I can't even remember. The rest of my afternoon was pretty weird; I spent 15 minutes in line at the ATM on campus. There are plenty of ATMs, even on in the library, but only one accepts deposits. Perhaps it was bad timing to want to make a deposit on the last Friday of the month. Really strange, and it would have been fine except the one girl in front of me was having some problems and took 4x the time she should have.  Then I went to my friend Phil's WIP. 'Anxiety and Epistemology: The Role of Outlaw Emotion in Democracy.' It was really cool -- he followed arguments that oppressed groups in society tend to think more rationally as a result of their anxiety (ability be in the moment and see things as they are). Based on his title, I had no idea how he was going to bring those four big topics together, but I really enjoyed it.  I went to two grocery stores to do some big shopping. I ended up buying a ton of sweets: three kinds of cookies, ice cream, pop tarts. Also, a ton of breakfast stuff: a box of dry cereal, oatmeal, cream of wheat, and 5 grain rolled hot cereal. I was hungry for oatmeal earlier, and I got home without realizing I bought two kinds of it. I did get some regular food, too."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Anyway, I just decided to use the name I put on all my online dealings. So I can be reached at my new gmail account by sending email to  vaeric @ gmail.com  (spaces added to prevent spam). I just got my email address of abe@ihumpmypillow.com for this blog, but I'm just going to trash that one now since I won't need it and nobody has emailed me to that account anyway. So it's not going to be used anymore, don't email me there. So I'm going to move all my email dealings to this account instead of my hotmail and yahoo accounts. I'm going to see if I can forward all my old yahoo and hotmail emails over to this account so I have copies of all my important old emails on those accounts. 1 gig of email space will be SOOOO nice after always running out of room every other day with measly little 5 meg accounts.  Since it's shitty out today, I decided to beta test a MMORPG call  urlLink Ryzom . It's a free open beta test, so it'll be a good diversion without having to pay the monthly fee for now. I think it would be an alright game, but true to its beta-ness, I constantly get high ping and disconnects from the server 5 minutes or so into every play session. Then I have to load the game back up (which takes like 2 minutes) just to have it happen again. So there, I found a bug already.   The rest of this weekend was a lot of fun. Soccer practice on Friday night was a lot better than my first practice. I think I'll have a hold of coaching in another week or so. And my team won their first game 7-2. They played awesome. There's still a few things we need to work on, but the kids all love to play, so it's not too hard to get them motivated. And Alicia, the Assistant Coach, does a great job of reminding me to not skim over details or reminds me when I forget anything important. Very helpful, I don't think I'd be able to keep everything straight without her around. My multi-tasking skills aren't all that great.

Derek was also at Jeffy's place Friday and earlier Saturday, but by the time Sean and I got over there on Saturday night, he had already left.

I'm trying to figure out why when we were in school there all we did was bitch about going to these bars when now it sucks when you have to leave. And a night out in Point can be finished without a good trip to Taco Bell. Two grilled stuft burritos and I was out for the night. A little bit of foosball, a few drinks, and plenty of great looking women around always makes for a great night.  But now I'll shut up and go play in my new Gmail account.

I stayed at home all day.  &nbsp;  I woke up at 11am and watched one VCD 'When Harry Met Sally'; an old 90s&nbsp;movie.&nbsp; It's pretty nice, hahahaha cracked me up.&nbsp; Then I was too sleepy, so I went to bed again for an evening nap.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt 'paralysed' in my sleep again... may be I'm too exhausted, and I haven't&nbsp;full recovered from my flu yet.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  When I woke up at&nbsp;6pm, I realised JoLee's not at home.&nbsp; I was soo worried,&nbsp;I kept yelling her name.&nbsp; You know, the wind was so strong around that time, and&nbsp;was raining cats and dogs!!&nbsp;Where was she?? She's nuts to go out at that time!! I called her bf, he told me Jo's out for food! I was so mad when I heard that 'How could he let her leave home in such weather condition?? Don't they know how to take care of themselves??? They should stay home!' Then my mom called from Shenzhen (she went there with her friends), and she told me she would be taking a taxi home. I was like 'WHAT? NO!! YOU should stay where you are! It's dangerous to come home now!' Well, she didn't listen to me.&nbsp; I was so freaked out at that moment that I broke into tears.&nbsp; No one seemed to understand my worries&nbsp;at that time.&nbsp; So I locked up&nbsp;myself in&nbsp;my&nbsp;room, and prayed to God.&nbsp; 'Please take them home safely'.&nbsp; Thank God! They both arrived home safely.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  While I was hiding in my room, I checked the internet and realised an Assistant Professor (Dr. William Wong) is missing in Beijing.&nbsp; At that moment, I totally understand how Wong's family members are feeling now! Feeling miserable and desolate (tho' compared to theirs, mine is nothing) Please pray for them.&nbsp; May God grant them peace and comfort.&nbsp; Then, I did a lot of things.&nbsp; I found comfort from writing my diary, reading God's words, praying and singing praises to God.&nbsp; I even wrote down the melody of the song I composed with Vonne last Monday.&nbsp; And wrote&nbsp;another new song tonight (only part of it tho')&nbsp;&nbsp;I can find real comfort from God.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'll be meeting Livia tomorrow morning to talk about the song&nbsp; I wrote, and ask for some feedbacks and help.&nbsp; Thanks Livia for your help! You really have an extraordinary gift from God!! Keep up your great work!

I only talked to them for a second, but they have a lot of plans to get ready for our coming.  Hopefully we'll be able to get a fairly reasonable place, which I'm sure Michael will talk about when he writes very soon.  My cousin, Crystal, called me today.  She's pretty excited about me coming out.  She said I could actually stay with her until we get settled, if I need to.  I thought that was sweet of her, but she's always been one of my favorites, anyway.  It will be nice to actually know someone who lives out there, so that's something to look forward to.       My friend, James, e-mailed the other day warning me that California wasn't everything he had expected.  He gave me a bit of forewarning.  He had just gotten back from there that morning.  He has a movie he's going to be releasing sometime this year titled 'Ritual Season', I believe.  He's really into the horror genre.  Keep your eyes opened for it.  I can't wait, myself.  He's a pretty cool cat.  I really miss his company.  So, you hear that Mike and Amanda...watch out!  California is a shifty place.  Don't lose my money or I'll throttle you with my bare feet!         Chuck just left a few minutes ago.  I get the feeling he and his girl are not prepared for his departure.  I think they're trying to soak in as much time together as possible and tear apart at the last possible second.  That's cool and all, I mean, from the time I've spent with her, she's really cool, definitely a keeper.  I'm just really worried about both of them when it finally comes to the last second.  I just hate the idea of how much this going to hurt each of them.  They seem so happy that it's almost bittersweet.  I'm really happy for Chuck, but I know what's coming around the corner.  Just be careful, guys-and be ready.  It's really, really close.       I went into work today and they had the new schedule up, and under my name it was just 7 'U's (for unavailable).  It was a little surreal.  It's right there in front of me and it still isn't completely sinking in.  My cold feet are freezing up.  I feel like I'm going to have an anxiety attack when it finally hits me really good.  My heart's already beating a little fast just thinking about it.  Don't worry, there's no backing down, but WHOA!  What the heck am I doing?       Before I go, I just want to say how great Mike's family is.  They are so supportive...of all of us.  I just wanted to say a quick 'thanks' to all of them:  Tim, Deb, Nick, and Mandy.  Mike's a very lucky guy.       Until next time..."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I promised it to him and you have four of your own).  I still feel like I'm on a plane right now, and I almost forgot to pick up my son from camp last night. When I did get him (at about 5:59pm--one minute before they call DYFS), I was greeted by his counsellor who happened to be holding a purple 'report.'  Apparently, my little 'angel' hit a girl yesterday. They were scuffling over a water balloon (excuse me, but why are 13-14 year old kids having a water balloon fight? Doesn't that seem like a dumb idea to anyone but non-violent me?), and this girl stole and burst the aforementioned balloon in question. This just pushed my boy over the edge, and he punched her in the stomach. Gee it's good to be back home...  Our driver retrieved us from JFK, and took a 'shortcut' through Manhattan. It was my first trip past the site of the WTC, ironically in the news today on two accounts: first, Liebskind and Silverstein are intangled in a lawsuit over payment of fees, and second, the 9/11 commission releases its report to the public at 11:30 am Eastern Daylight Time.  Rambling here, I don't know up from down today, but I am pleased to know I was missed by someone other than my kid and my cat. I tried to post from Brussels, but the Internet cafe I visited had a European keyboard. Sounds minor, but all of the keys and punctuation were in different places, making it nearly impossible to type anything more than two simple sentences. What's my excuse now?\n\nText 2:New songs then. We've worked on three in the last few weeks. The first week  after we finished the demo we decided to have another play of one of my older  songs - You should know - which has hung around on the edges all this time  without ever being worked out. We added a kind of instrumental section to the  verses which, back home when I was trying to work out words, became a a nice,  high pitched, dramatic chorus. Playing it together again Pete added some backing  vocals and we reversed the quiet verse / loud chorus approach of the demo to  make it a little odder and sweeter. It sounds good.  Next we worked on a great song of Andy's which, on first play, came across a  bit like an early Blur number. By the time we'd mucked about with it a bit it  had acquired a slightly darker hue but retained a big, rolling chorus which  would have not have been discarded by even the most discerning of late 80s  indie-dance acts. It doesn't have a name yet I don't think. But it's a really  good one.  Lastly, a rare day off from work earlier in the month gave me the opportunity  to turn a short bit of guitar I've been playing for a while into a whole song -  probably the song I've been most pleased with since I wrote Losin My Mind nearly  a year ago. I'm really enthusiastic about it; it's kinda Smithsy, Idlewildy -  potentially much more of a 'song' than my usual efforts. We only played it  together briefly last week. But it's next on the list.

ERIC Digest.  This is a good summary of the Foxfire approach to teaching.  Although I have never used the Foxfire books, I am familiar with them from my days as a librarian in Appalachia (Reference Desk, Ohio University at Zanesville.)  Many of my patrons loved these books.  I remember they came in handy when a patron wanted information on washtubs as musical instruments!  From the site:  The student-produced 'Foxfire Magazine' and a series of books on Appalachian life and folkways are popular manifestations of an experiential education program originally intended to teach basic English skills to high school freshmen in Appalachian Georgia. The Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning emerged from those classroom experiences. It evolved as a result of efforts to understand and replicate the project's success in helping learners meet curricular mandates (Wigginton, 1989).   Over time, hundreds of teachers have helped develop, edit, and revise Foxfire's 11 core practices to reflect new understandings and lessons learned through implementation. The core practices remain dynamic, and the work begun more than 30 years ago continues to expand and evolve.   This Digest describes the Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning as defined by the core practices, the decision-making framework the approach provides for teachers, and the ways the framework fits with John Dewey's notion of experiential education.\n\nText 2:Okay, I don't know how many of you played Dungeons and Dragons when you were younger (or hey, many of you probably do now), but I used to.

These Rutgers people aren't ever getting back to me, and I will probably have to start making more phone calls, it's been a week and I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THIS SUMMER.  The rest of the afternoon I worked on the Adoremus concert video.  AFterwards, I cooked spghetti for Vicky and Sophia, the two La Crescenta/Canada, CA girls that go here.  Vicky and I have been good friends from literally the first week of orientation.  Sophia I met by moving her stuff in her freshman year.  Anyhow, yeah, so the sauce turned out to be just as I've always envisioned my sauce to be... heavily flavored, full bodied, sweet but not too sweet, slightly salty, tangy, etc.. it was great.  I really liked it.  I don't think I'd ever want to go back to tomoto paste, pre-made sauces again... this was too good to be true.  And I owe it all to foodnetwork.com for the suggestion of putting equal parts fresh italian parsley and basil.  Anyhow, afterwards, we sat for a bit to digest.. then we had Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake Ice Cream.  GREAT STUFF.  Since it was all, done, we walked out.  Sophia went back home, Vicky and I went to the DMC to check on the Adoremus video, which was done dubbing to tape.  I then started the DivX encoding process so more nerdy people can watch it on computers. :-)  Vicky and I went for a walk and talk around campus, just like we've always done, it was a good time of catching up, debating, sharing, etc.  No, we're not involved or anything, she's already taken.  No feelings shared, either, so don't get any ideas.  After that, I went to J-Loo's place to hang out.  Dustin asked me to fix their VCR.. after much fiddling around, I discovered that the fuse had blown, and they needed to replace it.  This discovery was after I had been fiddling around with it for a while, though... phew.  I've been back now for 2 hours.

Chrissy Hines of The Pretenders is an Ohio native. And if nothing else, that band alone validates our state's cultural contribution. In addition to the poet Hart Crane and America's Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison. The great rock band The James Gang was named after the MAC championship Kent State Football team, and Joe Walsh dropped out of my high school. Allen Ginsberg taught at my college for two years. So I'm sick of all you East Coasters mocking us.   Went fishing with my dad and my brother this morning off the railroad tracks at Wingfoot Lake, 2 minutes from my parents old house that I lived in for 18 years. We caught a ton of little fish, saw an old neighbor, and got sunburnt. I used to work maintenance at the park across the lake.   Out on the tracks I was thinking about the person I was before I left for NJ. Most of the clothes I owned were secondhand. I rode my bike all over my old college town, to the bars, the independent book shop, the poetry readings. We had the Cuyahoga River, full of white bass all spring, and a trail running alongside. Towner's Woods was the biggest piece of public forest in Portage county, and home to one of the biggest Hopewell Indian burial mounds in all of Ohio. I used candles instead of lightbulbs, kept screened windows open, cooked bluegills, drove through fields, had bonfires, drank Black Labe beer in the can on front porches. I spent afternoons writing a bad novel, days off at the library.   I'm not sure what I'm trying to say, since I love ocean fishing and my job. But I do miss some of this.

Actuallly celebrated on the Friday with the work guys   (free champagne, lots of pints, JD and coke, shots of sambuka and chilly chille (don't even ask)   Fell over twice and managed to fuck up my ankle. Still hurts. Absolutely smashed out of my head.   (and there was a thing with chairs and it's a wonder we never broke anything)   (and I dropped a box of paper cups which bounced out of my arms and hit a woman)  Then celebrated on Saturday with my Enfield guys (although Kev and Matt made it down)  Started at 3.   Don't think there was any one moment when I didn't at the very least have two drinks on the go.  Had 3 in the Arms I think then went to the George for the cheap drinks and then over to Taps.  By which team they were getting me quadruple JD's (amongst other things).  People kept turning up through the evening and everytime they did someone shoved another drink infront of me.  Got to the Arms. Pint and two sambukas later I just had to leave the building.  Right so what did I do last weekend.  Erm Friday round Enfield. Much of the usual I think.  Saturday was Kerry's birthday and the band were playing which made for a good night. Got to the Arms at about 3.  David had bought me a bottle of JD for my birthday so we say outside and consumed that from about half 6 onwards.  (Kinda drunk as you can imagine)  And this is my point.  Birthdays.

It's a real headache especially a user who enjoy messing up configuration.  But anyway the moment i turn out of Bayshore park to ECP changi airport saw 3 cars was driving quite 'interestingly'. After the potted plants all went like 140kph so I follow them and I decided to go all the way till 170 and to my susprise i saw one Mazda 323 coming up very fast and tailing behind me. I simply can't shake it off even taking fast bend. It is simply too easy for him to catch even at 170kmph, do not know what the hell is implanted inside.  After exiting at Loyang fly over I gave him a thumbs up. Pretty friendly racing.  FUN after boring work at my auntie's office.....But have no idea why I feel like finding someone to chat with but no one to. The kind of loneliness creeping in again.\n\nText 2:My life I find it more confuseing day by day. I've been enjoying it more though. I've been spending time with a new friend, M., who is very kind and gentle.  The thing is... I still love, C., my ex fiance, I still hold him deep in my heart. He's been there thru so much for me. Although none of it physical, that is what I've been needed and craving for many months now. I've found what I've been needing in M.  I find this hard, because although I want to satisfy my own needs, I don't want anyone else to be hurt. I've not felt suicidal for almost a week now, it is such a relief. I've not cut for almost two weeks. The cuts are almost all healed.   I do feel such turmoil inside. Do I wait forever, in hopes that C. and I may be together, and what about all this fighting we've been doing. ANd all my issues with him thinking I'm fat. I usually don't have self confidence issues around men. I know that men find me attractive, and I don't usually feel fat around them. I've not had men that tell me they love me.. tell me that I'm fat.  I just don't get it. I guess part of it.. is that I'm very high maintenence. I enjoy alot of attention. I'm very emotional. I'm very needy. Is this because I'm borderline or just because I'm Julie.   Who is Julie? I'm starting to figure that out.    Julie??  Julie Ann Lathrop..  Born February 15th 1979, Port Allegany PA...  Is almost 25 years old Likes-Basketball, Drawing, Sketching, Basketball, Playing Computer Games, Chatting, Porn.. heheh (YES i said Porn..  I do enjoy it.. I admit.. Of both men and women), Dirty Jokes, Clean Jokes, Poetry, Reading, Driving, Dreaming, Talking, Kissing,  Favorite Colors- Purple ( then.. Purple w/ Pink and Blue) and Black Favorite Food- Pizza w/ lots of Cheese Favorite Cartoon- Smurfs Favorite Item- Harley Blanket  I've realized, I do have an identity... though, sometimes I realize I don't. When I'm with people. I tend to like to do the things they are doing. Is there anything wrong with that? Do I give up who I am to do that? I don't think I am. Borderline Personality Disorder says I do. I don't get it. I just find I am an easy going person, that enjoys many things.   Back to the men..thing..  am I being selfish.. or just stupid.. I don't know. I don't know what it is I really want. I thought I did. I do know, I need this thing, whatever it is, between me and Mike, I like it. Its enjoyable.  I do know I love C. with all my heart. As for my feelings for M. I don't know him well enough yet. I enjoy his company, and I am very attracted to him. I plan on spending as much time with him as I am able, because I feel this is something I need. For once, I don't feel pressure by a man, to please him.. or anything like that.

I miss one day and I get scolded for being lazy! You know who you are, big dog!! =) Just teasin ya. It's nice to know you're reading. Ok, so I'm back. I'm still sniffling and coughing, but I'm on the mend! In fact yesterday I thought I was all better, but this morning I woke up miserable again. It's crazy.  Due to my lovely sniffles I've been taking it fairly easy this week. My current writing assignment is to write vivid observations using each of my five senses. Yesterday after a nice cool rain, I decided to sit on the porch and describe the fresh, after-rain smell. Well, I walked onto the porch and realized, 'what am I thinking? I can't smell anything!!' I guess that assignment will have to wait until next week!  Sometimes honesty costs. I went in today to get my address corrected on my driver's license. When we first moved here I was getting the numbers in our address all mixed up. By the time I got myself unconfused, I realized the address on my license was wrong. I went in today to get it corrected and when I told the gentleman at the counter the correct address, he asked, 'was this just a typo or did you move?' I thought for half a second that if I told him it was a typo I could probably save myself the cost of getting it changed ($10!!). But I knew that I had given it to them wrong the first time, but they would never know. But I would know. So I told him 'When we first moved I kept getting the numbers mixed up, and I'm sure I gave it to you wrong.' He just peered at me over his glasses  with funny look and then said 'that will be $10.' I suppose that $10 is worth having a clean conscience and a good night's sleep.  While I've been nursing my sniffles the past couple days, I've indulged myself by scrapbooking. I'm working on finishing up the pictures from our  urlLink Alaska trip  last August. That trip seems like such a long time ago! We came back from that trip, turned in our two weeks notices and moved three weeks later. With all that flurry of activity, we really didn't have time to reflect much on our trip after we returned. It's been so much fun to relive those memories as I've scrapbooked the pictures. It makes me want to go on another adventure!! Ked and I LOVE traveling together. There's nothing like bonding as you end up in all these fun and unusual circumstances together. You just never know what or who you'll encounter, like the time we stood up in 2 complete strangers' wedding in South Dakota. Ahh... I'll save that one for another day...to keep you coming back for more!!! =)  Later!\n\nText 2:transcriptions are very tedious work - that's got to be a better way to make money."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Like the night before last when it really started coming down, another lady from work had to evacuate her house because the entire walls in the basement collapsed from all the rain, had to call her son to help her get the animals out 'cause they were scared and hiding under the beds... gas line broke and it was really concentrated inside the house there. She was lucky to get herself and everyone else out, but imagine. She stopped by during one of our breaks yesterday with her son, she was just in tears, said the whole downstairs was just rubble, the foundation's shot, and they said it wasn't even safe yet to go back in for some clothes. I really feel bad for her. It could have been a lot worse though, she could have been asleep and ended up being trapped inside with all that gas when it happened. Oh and the hospital sprung leaks everywhere from the rain, there were a couple of code reds, from where water got into the wiring and shorted out some lights. Puddles all in the patient rooms up on 5th floor, half the break area was completely soaked, an inch of water in Healthline, the classrooms there. They had the wet-vacs running nonstop yesterday. The lead kept saying 'This is the day from Hell'  And she tried calling the supervisors but they weren't answering their phone.

I got my radio assignment back today. Had overslept and missed class this morning - the second time this week! I was royally pissed that it happened - really wanted to make the class and discuss/workshop my ideas with people 'coz i was  feeling a little lost. Was so upset. Ack. Anyways saw my tutor just before her next class and got back my radio assignment, which i did pretty ok in.  My good buddy Charles got his back too - and i'm pretty upset on his behalf. I read his piece a little before he handed it in, and i really don't think it deserved a P. At the very very least an H3 (the grading system in Melbourne Uni is H1, then H2A, H2B, H3, Pass, Fail). And according to him she sorta 'dissed' his idea for the feature story too.  He wanted to write on Palms - or rather Personal Digital Assistants. Can you believe that she hasn't heard of them? Then again, I'm not surprised...apparently Australia is about 5 years behind in the whole PDA world - like their AUSPUG (Australian Palm Users Group) was just set up recently (as compared to the thriving one in S'pore and the States which have been around for ages). Geez Louiz...  Oh wells, so much for that. He's gonna try to reangle his story, and pitch it again. Hope she takes the bait!  As for me, I'm planning to do my topic on Naturopathy. Like natural healing and all. But i think the story's been done before, so I'm trying to take a fresh approach. I thought of pursuing the angle of people studying naturopathy and why they choose to do so etc., but i realise that it's too narrow for a 2500-wd piece. The most i can squeeze outta this angle is about 1500 wds? And that's the max. So what to do then? (Any ideas, please let me know). I'll prob. see her again on Monday to discuss.  All ritey then. I'm gonna sleep now. Even though i don't really feel sleepy - slept from about 6-10pm just now! eeks..screwing up my whole system.

However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  '  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  '  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning."], "gold_label": 1.0}

When you see the giant list of Phobias, it's hard to imagine they left any out , but mine are very obscure. The first one is the irrational fear that I've just walked into the wrong bathroom, characterized by repeatedly poking my head out the door to check the sign and occasionally leaving the stall door slightly open so I can see urinals.  (I realize some of you may not have wanted to know that, but when I'm ranting it's hard to stop) My second and much worse fear is talking to answering machines.  They're horribly misnamed, because they don't answer.  They talk, beep, and then just listen silently.  The worst part is, unlike people, they remember everything they hear perfectly.  Once you've said it, there's no taking it back. So, normally, if I call someone and the answering machine picks up, I hang up immediately in fear.  Sometimes, though, you just have to reach someone.  In these cases I'll leave a message.  I'll start talking, but the silence on the other end makes me uncomfortable, and I start rambling to fill the silence, until I've forgotten what I was gonna say, at which point I start mumbling and hang up.  After I've hung up, I realize how awful it sounds and call back in order to apologize for the first message and say what I need to say, but this doesn't always work as planned either.  So, anyone I call and leave a message for thinks I'm a gibbering idiot, and it's all the fault of those dram answering machines.

I had no idea how much revisionist history I'd been absorbing.  Europeans have only been the big players for  maybe  six hundred years.  The Chinese empire lasted like four times that long.  Dar Al Islam lasted almost twice that long.  But what do we learn about as kids?  The last 200 years.  The ones that involve America.  Maybe a little about Europe.

You can tell us.\n\nText 2:Random Rants  By Duf 'New and Improved with Extra Links' Fer  1.  I feel sorry for  urlLink Ralph Nader .  He's going to get creamed, and he is going to look like a traitor in the process.  As a (Big D) Democrat, I have to tell you, the one thing we Dems need this electoral season is unity.  We have to be singular in our focus, and any divisiveness is against the plan.  Our friends across the aisle have done a masterful job of keeping their team together behind one goal (even though there are two very different types of conservatives (social conservatives versus fiscal conservatives) they stay together.  Fight and make deals behind the scenes, but in public, have one party, one platform, one message).  We need to match that togetherness.  My main man Nader is tearing that down.  Ralph is running without a party affiliation.  He had no chance of winning in 2000, and he has even less of a chance now.  I really want to see his issues highlighted (especially universal health care and 100% publicly financed elections), but running for President when you have ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE OF WINNING is not the way to do it.  It comes off as an exercise in ego.  Personally, I don't think even Ralph can derail the donkey this November, but why try.  Why run the risk of having as part of your resume 'delivered 8 years of Bush'?  So I feel sorry for Ralph and fear that all he is going to do is end up tarnishing the memory of a man whose legacy should be safer cars, OSHA and the EPA.  2.  I saw  urlLink Frank Vascellaro  and  urlLink Amelia Santaniello  at Target in Edina.  I didn't speak.  3.  If you live in MN and you have any free time at all, I beg you:  run (don't walk) run to see  urlLink Hairspray .  I saw it yesterday afternoon, and it is wonderful.  It is racy (double entendre - pun intended), but the cast has so much fun, and the fun is so contagious that you can't help but have a blast.  Also, the music is great.  I must confess, that as one of a very, very, very few African-Americans in the audience, I found it ironic that this play talking about integration in the 60s has not yielded perhaps as much progress as we sometimes think we've made.  For obvious reasons, I know very few people who choose not to spend time with others based on race, but, for some reason, you don't see many events or communities that are truly integrated.  It really stood out at the show.  4.   urlLink Vacation on Friday .  Can't wait.  5.  What ever you do, no matter how desperate you get to save money on goods you buy every day.

I had never seen it before, and it was halfway through, so I thought I'd catch it.  I found myself having a lot of sympathy for the Bill Pullman character.  Such a caring, understanding, mature guy, and he gets blown off by this unstable female.  He goes to the length of TAILORING HIS MOTHER'S WEDDING RING for her... and for what?  She's liked someone else all along, and she's led him on.  And even when he knows she's going to reject him, he still puts on a gentle smile and lets her go.  Poor Bill Pullman character.

Kind of partial to this one. I have started a new life recently, and also decided to write a book about my whole life. So what better than this blog to help organize my thoughts for my book.  Part of my whole new life is shaving my head. I have shaved it three times. I went thru a phase where I wasnt growing or getting better like I planned but worse. Now I have come to realize so many things, and am letting my hair grow, and my life is growing with it. I am starting to heal. I have a long journal, and many paths and dead ends along the way.  I have been on alot of medications, and currently trying to get off. I want my mind to be clear. I have recently fallen in love. C, well I love him dearly, he has been a great support to me thru all this. We do have our ups and downs, but when I speak and chat with him, I am overjoyed with love and affectionate feelings. It feels good, to know someone loves me. JP has also helped me thru this. I write to him when I feel down. Most people don't think he is really a good person, but I know in his heart he is. He would give his life for his loved ones. He has led a troubled life like myself, only he never really had any LOVE or SUPPORT at all. I hope to go and see him soon. Sort of as a closure, to the love we had... because I am moving on with my life.  I have to move on soon, and make a place for myself, I am almost strong enough. I few more weeks or months, will tell. I will know, I will feel it in my heart when I am ready. Until then, I will just stay put. Hard, but tolerable.   I will end this tonite, mostly because I am tired and have a long day tommorrow. I am helping A help herself, which is a good thing. But it means I have to get up early.

Ive been talking to someone recently, who is flat out  fun . Quite frankly shes probably the most  fun  person that Ive met here in jolly old Binghamton. I guess to sum it all up I find her wit absolutely charming. That combined with intelligence, humor, and good looks, you cant help but go Damn, shes unavailable!? and secretly think what ifs. I guess there's like one lucky dude out there and Ive gotta give him props. Also if this young lady, whom I know occasionally reads my incessant ramblings, figures out that Im talking about her, I say take this as a compliment. People should be reminded that they kick ass from time to time.  Yep thats one personal thought. The other one is that Ive been feeling really content lately. I think the fact that I am being productive really improves my mood. This semester is ending on a high note. It was a bit of a drag early on since, I wasnt happy with a lot of stuff. Now I feel like Im actually doing something with myself. With only 23 days until I land in LAX, Im looking forward to a winter break where I can do some reading for the sake of reading. I hope to read some postmodernist theory books, some fiction like Chuck Palahniuk and Sartre, and some non-fiction like  Fast Food Nation . Also some punk rock shows and fun in the sun?  I guess the only time my contentment falters is when I look too deeply into the future. My future is just so vague. Do I have 3 or 4 or 5 years left here? What should I do my area papers on? What about my dissertation? A job!? Yea thats scary shit.  However, when I look at the here and now. Im cool. Its all chill. I think its a matter of mentally dealing with modernist conceptions of future desire. The insatiable thirst for progress into the future. That desire, as Buddhists believe, is the source of suffering. Im by no means a theist of any sort, but contentment is where it is at. Live life day by day and keep shit simple. I certainly dont mean  carpe diem  - - seize the day. Thats too imperative. Like I said, keep shit simple. Like the things I hope to do in the winter are just rough sketches its all really  whatever .   As Arnold says in  Total Recall  - - 'Chill out... you'll live longer.'  Oh yea... while I'm at it...

I propose a Battle of the Pointless Shows.\n\nText 2:This is one lovely article which I had received a while ago in my egroup for Psychology...  Top Ten relationship wreckers!!!  1. Neglecting Your Partner (ignoring, workaholism, addictions):A primary function of a relationship is to provide companionship and to meet each other\u2019s needs. When other activities, interests or preoccupations interfere with our availability, we can wind up short-changing our partner. This can be thought of as absenteeism. Taking an inventory and making adjustments in how we spend our time is the first step in correcting this problem. Treat your partner as the important person they are by spending enough quality time together to satisfy each of your requirements in this area and to maintain your connection.  2. Depriving Your Partner (not being attentive, expressive, affectionate, supportive, caring, loving):Being there physically is not enough. We cannot expect our relationship to thrive if we withdraw emotionally for extended periods of time. In order to be fully present, we must be aware of our partner and be willing to show how we feel both verbally and non-verbally. Expressing love though affection and caring behaviors are crucial to keeping a relationship strong and vibrant. Small regular doses of intimacy will usually suffice, and the most important times of day to communicate positively are upon waking, upon reuniting after a long day, and before going to sleep.  3. Dishonesty & Betrayal (infidelity, lying):Most people are aware that the foundation of any relationship is T-R-U-S-T. In no relationship is trust more important than in a relationship between mates, except for a parent and dependent child relationship. Cheating and lying breaks down the basis for a relationship, and often results in its demise. A problem of this nature is serious, and resolving it must be a top priority if the relationship is to survive.&nbsp;  4. Attacking Your Partner (blaming, abuse \u2013 physical, emotional, sexual):Aggressive communication is simply unacceptable, especially if the abuse is getting physical. Physical or sexual abuse are deal-breakers in a marriage/ relationship, and should prompt a permanent separation. The abusive partner needs to get professional help to learn skills in&nbsp;anger managemet, &nbsp;in order to gain and consistently demonstrate better control over his or her emotions and behavior. Even if the help is sought and progress is made, the risk of recurrence remains high, so in most cases, the abused partner should not return to the relationship. Returning serves to reinforce the abusive behavior, leading to increased severity and frequency of subsequent abuse. Instead, the abused partner should also seek help, and work through issues that have potential to lead one into another abusive relationship. Verbally blaming, accusing, and insulting your partner are less extreme forms of destructiveness, but are not OK either, and&nbsp;assertiveness training can provide the essential skills for healthy communication.  5. Scapegoating (taking your anger or frustration out on you partner):We all know that it\u2019s not right to kick the dog after a hard day at work, so why do it to your partner? Being held responsible for things that are out of our control is the most stressful of conditions, and that is what we do to our partner when we scapegoat them. Rather than hurt the ones you love, do what it takes to meet the real problem head-on, as effectively as you can. If you are unsure of how to address a problem, the strong and mature thing to do is to ask for help and support from trusted sources (i.e., a friend, relative, or therapist).   6. Negativism (nitpicking, nagging, criticizing):In order to have a good relationship, the positives must outweigh the negatives by a large percentage. If negativity is creeping into your relationship, it is like water seeping into walls, eventually weakening the structure. People usually feel good around others who are upbeat and positive, as well as those who help them to feel good about themselves. Bringing a negative spirit into your relationship crowds out the positive. However, pushing aside or neglecting to address real problems is not the answer either, and can be just as harmful to relationship health as dwelling on the negative. So pick your battles wisely, strive to communicate effectively, and practice cooperative negotiation.  7. Gossiping (telling family or friends about your problems but not addressing them with your partner):That\u2019s right, if you are talking about the problems in your relationship with friends or relatives but not working on improving the situation, that amounts to gossip. Gossip is not a productive way to handle problems, and can result in additional problems. For instance, your partner may feel betrayed that you revealed sensitive material to others that cause him or her to be embarrassed or uncomfortable around them. Also, if you promote a negative side of your partner or your relationship, others may get a distorted view, and changes in their attitudes and behavior may follow. Others may remember your conflicts long after you and your partner have gotten past them. Instead, work on improving your communication skills. Turn toward your partner, not away. If you need help, seek out the assistance of an objective third party such as a therapist who works with couples. When it comes to your needs, stop complaining and start asking!  8. Controlling Your Partner (\u201cmy way\u201d or else, perfectionism, trying to change your partner, possessiveness):Wanting things to be a certain way and having preferences are completely natural and even healthy. However, when this tendency becomes extreme and starts to encroach on the rights, needs and desires of others, it can cause major havoc. Freedom of will and self-determination are basic needs, and when these are being threatened, negative reactions may include anger, resentment, and/or rebellion. If the need to control is a problem in your relationship, identify the motivations behind it and work towards dealing with those issues rather than acting them out with your partner.  9. Putting Yourself First (self-centeredness, selfishness, entitlement):It\u2019s not \u201call about me,\u201d folks. Letting one\u2019s self interests take priority in an unbalanced way can be toxic to a partnership. The other person usually winds up feeling deprived, resentful, and unimportant. Furthermore, the more self-involved you are, the more you take your relationship for granted, the less you appreciate your partner, and the more alone you actually are. So if your relationship is slanted in this way, you also lose out, because you experience less of the joy that a true connection brings. You and you partner both get more from the relationship through reciprocity in giving and receiving.  10. Putting Yourself Last (self-neglect, passivity, self sacrifice):Martyrs are seldom happy. More often, they are angry, bitter, resentful, depressed and burned out. This is not to say that you should not consider others and be thoughtful in meeting their needs. But having a healthy relationship involves factoring your own needs and desires into the equation. You teach people how to treat you, and if you act like a doormat, you can\u2019t completely blame someone if they wipe their feet on you. Learn how to stand up for yourself, practice assertive communication, ask and allow others to meet your needs, and take care of yourself as much as you take care of your loved ones.

Suffice to say I'm back.  I have all the letters my mom sent me when I was in college. I distinctly remember opening my mailbox one day and being excited to see an envelope in there--must have been waiting for something from someone--and thinking, 'Oh, it's just a letter from Mom.' And in the same split-second I thought to myself that there would come a day when I would give anything for a letter from her, because she didn't write any more... No, no, she's alive and well, and our relationship is fine. But she doesn't write any more. I think it was a holdover from her own college days, when she started writing her mother once a week, a habit she continued as long as I lived at home. I miss those letters. I wish she had e-mail, because I would write her all the time.\n\nText 2:Ah, my favorite column. Admittedly, I haven't had time to keep up on this as much as I'd like to in the last week, but a few things caught my eye.    Politics:    Kerry and Edwards roll on. I'm really looking forward to the debates this year and hope that we get some decent material to evaluate Kerry and Edwards on. I really hope somebody calls out the fact that they just keep promising programs and initiatives that cost money- lots of it- but also say they'll reduce the federal deficit. Think about this one for a moment. They want to spend trillions of dollars on healthcare, alternative energy research, and all kinds of education initiatives but also say they'll reduce the difference between the government's income and its expenses. The questions have to be as follows:    a) what spending will be reduced? Based on his record, probably support for our military. Nothing better than cutting their funding at a time when they have to train for and adapt to an entirely new kind of enemy as they battle terrorist cells around the world. The urban-style warfare that is required is more costly to support than traditional warfare. Will Kerry fund it? Somebody please ask him. If so, what will he cut?    b) whose taxes will be increased? If expenses won't go down, income must go up to reduce the deficit. I can tell you whose taxes- everybody's. Especially corporations and 'the rich.' The funny thing about raising tax rates for the wealthy is that they have so many tax-reducing activities that they can afford to operate and participate in that recent studies show they only pay about 16% of their annual income in taxes to the federal government. So why not raise rates for a group that will remain largely unaffected in real terms- to make it look like you're doing something- while increasing spending? Result- higher deficits. Also, more of the wealthy, who would otherwise invest in businesses to gain profits, end up having to find tax write-offs and shelters to protect their money from the government. Less money into the economy, little to no more to government, and increased government spending- you have a great recipe for killing economic expansion.     On the Republican front, continued assertions that Cheney will stay on the Republican ticket. The fact that he even needs to defend that position is funny to me. Almost as funny as him cursing at Leahy. The thing I find interesting about that whole situation is that anyone would expect a member of an administration that is under constant personal, venomous attack by many and nagging, subtle cheapshots from several others to take it all and not fire back at some point. Keep poking a dog with a stick and sooner or later, you'll get bitten. All this proved to me is that Cheney's human for what he did and a lot more patient than me for how long it took him to do it.    Economics:    Greenspan's Capitol Hill report revealed little new information but continued to support the fact that economic growth is real, appears to be sustainable, and is broadening week by week to include employment, production, and most major areas. Of course, the ignorant still cry that the sky is falling because they personally don't have twice the income they had last year. And they complain about inflation, since it's the one area that even Greenspan has acknowledged needs to be watched closely. Econ 101- with currency devaluation, prices rise. With loose monetary policy (targeting lower rates as the Fed has for past years), prices rise. Greenspan knows it and will adjust rates up if he has to.

First of all I want to get this off my chest: 'what a load of shit'. Now, let me get to the real stuff.  Australia is one of the truly democratic nations in the world. Sure, it isn't perfect - like most nations it is run by wealthy white heterosexual men and has a long history of native blood going splat in the name of Christianity. But hey, which country doesn't?!  One thing we can be proud of, despite our ills, is that we have a nation that is pretty darn good in comparison to other 'democracies'. We have a system of compulsory, preferential voting that ensures everybody's vote (whether informed or not) counts. We have a vibrant pluralist system (occasionally), a strong bureaucracy (despite it being undermined in recent years) with fairly good appeals processes, and most importantly, a parliament that allows for alternative policies to the government of the day. Not only that, we have two current affairs shows that ensure that just about anyone can get their opinions heard. Unless of course you're a hippy, a bureaucrat, a welfare worker, a dodgy builder or any sort of do-gooder. Alas, I digress.  I was talking about how Australia is a democratic nation, with a parliament that allows for something that is strange to the likes of George Bush: a viable opposition. Mark Latham, as the next Prime Minister of this country, has the FREEDOM, through this DEMOCRATIC institution that he is about to lead, to express his point of view on Iraq. Now, I may diagree with Mark Latham's position on many things, but on this one I think he is right on the money. But, that is beside the point.  George Bush walks around, bible in hand, dribbling rhetoric about 'freedom' and 'democracy', but does not promote it in his policies, in his speeches or in Iraq. But of course, we all know that America is an autocracy disguised cleverly as a democracy. George Bush acts  in spite of  public opinion and without the mandate of the American people. People cannot forget that. But again, I digress.  This democracy that Australia has, as complex as it may be, is more representative than America. Here, the government of the day, for better or worse, has the mandate of the Australian people. Sure, they are accountable in the Senate, but Australians like it that way. If the ALP win this election, troops will be withdrawn from Iraq. This means that Mark Latham will have the mandate of the majority of Australians to withdraw troops from Iraq.  Surely George Bush would not argue with that? After all, he is such a huge fan of freedom and democracy...\n\nText 2:Thong recently told us about how her dog  insists  on dry-humping her leg...all the time.

He pointed me to a recent interview with Sascha KMFDM that gives the whole story: 'In 1991 we started recording MONEY. MONEY was not supposed to be called MONEY. It was supposed to be called SPLIT because En Esch and I decided to break up during the tour with Thrill Kill Kult in 1990. So we decided that our next recording budget would split half and a half. I would get one half and he would get one half and we would both make 5 songs. Back on those days it was all still on vinyl. So he made 5 songs, I made 5 songs and we threw the coin and decided who gets the A and who gets the B side of the record. WAX TRAX rejected B side which was the En Esch's side. They said it didn't sound like KMFDM at all and that they didn't like it.They didn't want to put it out because it didn't meet the criteria of the label. So they gave us more money.

If you try to help them feel better, they resist and argue for their problems.

All those familiar feelings of being in love. Queasy tummy, heart skipped a beat, smiling and talking to myself while doing my work. I was feeling nice and lovely. Sweet and horny. I noticed there is a change in me.  Utopian Hunter was someone I never expected as appeared. I was resigned to fate of what the outcome was going to be. Interestingly, I was amazed when he approached me with nothing special but a cute smile and a bag of Hungry Jack's. He reminded me of any other tertiary students, yet, my jaws were locked open when he sat next to me, digging his dinner out from that bag and smile. He was hungry. The public never suspected it was meant to be a blind-date thingy. The weather was so cold and I was shivering inside - due to being nervous too?  We sat at a coffee joint later to prolong our conversation. I was too excited and nervous to think of any hot drinks to warm my body as he asked for my order. I was getting dodgy, so I volunteered to get our order instead of him. Soonest my order was ready, the voluntary disposition caused me to be drenched in my own latte probably due to an unstable tray that caused the tall glass to spill or was it really me who was a typical klutz whose life was never to serve. Yesss.... I felt stupid and clumsy... but I kept my cool, looked at the mess, smiling and laughing over my stupidity instead of standing there and really look stupid! Watta hell... I ordered for another and walked straight out to serve his bottled drink, a brief explanation of the mess, and rushed to the ladies to clear my own mess on my shirt, skirt and shoe.  All refreshed then, collected my 2nd latte (for free though I offered to pay for it) and walked straight to him who had been anxiously waiting. The loneliness bore him. We had brief discussion of anything we could think of. It was easy. Utopian Hunter has nothing against my thoughts and neither do I. It feels more natural unlike how I talked things with other men whose discussions were only apparently trying hard to impress me with their intellect. And I juz let them talk watever they could project their intellectual mind to me. While I played my role as a Barbie doll on display.  We parted at the train station in such an odd way. I think he felt strange too. In the whole journey smelling of latte, I was thinking that Allah is perfectly well acquainted to our daily affairs. God put a smile upon my face. And with this relief I'm getting, I figured...... my prayer was answered.......?? It feels like Saturday again!  Anyway, we chatted some more over the phone when we're already home! I found out, we are more or less on the same boat on why he is still unattached just like me. There are more gorgeous girls and good looking men out there looking for love/sex, and yet, we opted to be singled-out. I was guessing, he felt what I felt, like how any other users felt, the aftermath of any sorta affair that was going nowhere. And Radiohead sang True Love Waits.

So, what's your break-up story?  My previous girlfriend was a mess.  When she wasn't 'hanging' out with her previous boyfriend, she was calling me at work threatening to cut herself if I said I'd break up with her.  Yeah...a real keeper.  Well, we were on and off and when we were back on, she decided that she wanted to go on a 'business trip' with her ex-boyfriend.  You know...just as 'friends.'  I wasn't too crazy about the idea.  When I grilled her about the accomodations, I learned that she was indeed staying in a hotel room with him with only ONE bed.  Her logic was: 'Yeah, but you've stayed with your friend in Oregon and she's a girl.'  For the record, I slept in the bottom bunk of her kid's bed.  Not even REMOTELY the same thing.  Despite my pleas for her to not go, she went.  When she came back, I promptly dumped her like a visit to the restroom after eating at Khan's Mongolian BBQ.  The following is an e-mail conversation that transpired weeks after the dump-age..    Crazy:  I'm sorry I called you so late last night. I just wanted to tell you about this dream I had that you were in....blah blah blah blah...   DJS:  What part of 'I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU EVER AGAIN' don't you understand?   2. Have you ever lied to spare feelings when breaking up with someone?   I used to.  I've got this thing in my genetic code where I don't want to let people down, including ex-girlfriends.  The previous story (and yeah, there's a lot more to it) was the exception to the rule.  I don't give two shits about that psycho now.   3. Stevie Wonder says 'there is superstition.' Discuss.

I think so.. I think the market will expand to 10% by end of year.. why? Same way Dell got to be number one... it's how many times you hear the brand, see the brand, see the quality. I think people are tired of seperate hardware / software... in cell phones, PDAs, and music players they are use to getting them both in one package, updated on their own.

Watched some of the Seaview League finals at Laguna Hills High. It was a kind of a dissappointment, since Irvine's not the wrestling program it used to be. I also had to cut out early because I had to go check out a book from the UCI Main Library and have dinner with Lisa.  Dinner with Lisa was cool. She came over and made some Ecuadorian food... beef, potatoes, rice... at the time it was alright, but now many hours removed, I think it was really good. That's probably why I gobbled up all the left overs for lunch. I had the same delayed reaction when I had Ethiopian food with Naomi. I guess I need to contemplate before I appreciate. Afterwards we chatted on a variety of things, I taught her how to do charts on Excel and installed Power Point on her laptop, and we went to see  A Beautiful Mind , which was a good movie.  All in all yesterday was a cool day, topped off with good eats, and good entertainment.  Today is a different story. On my to do list today is...  Read  Stepping Left: Dance and Politics in New York City, 1928-1942  by tomorrow. It's 177 pages!  Do 14 statistic problems by Tuesday!  Read  African Perspectives on Colonialism  by Wednesday for my presentation. It's a 112 pager.  Read 2 history of coffee articles by Wednesday. They're 19 and 36 pages.  Write a 5 page paper on the 6 history of coffee articles I'm supposed to have read by Wednesday!  I don't even remember what I need to do for sociology 155!  If I get a chance I might try to work on Lisa's eucharist calendar dilemma.  Playing right now is 'Anesthesia' by Bad Religion, a song which I won't be hearing on March 30th at the Palladium, because I won't be there!!!  **\n\nText 2:So the pizza crust didn't turn out quite perfectly last night.

It makes me look forward to seeing the Vandals... that is if someone will just go with me!  Worked today... it was a fairly ok day. That's $60 more for me. I did some chatting with Lisa... not sure why. I guess I can't help but be friendly to my co-workers... even good old Margarita. I think certain people in the company can learn from me... not to be praising myself or anything.  Alas nothing is going on this week, except for hanging out with Flo before she goes to Texas. Perhaps I'll practice violin? Pick up a hobby? It has yet to be determined.  ***"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Pretty easy by any standards.  Heh, Max Payne is such a badass :p  Mona Sax is such a hotty.  But yeah, the game owns, go play it, it's worth it just for the story.    That's all I really did today, play games, practice driving and did some homework, really uneventful, no interesting stories.  Oh wait. there is one.  I went to Shopper's World today to get some print cartridges, some bins, some clothes and a replacement toque.  As you can see, the picture in the below post has me wearing my favourite toque, it's all black with a simple Nike checkmark in the front.  It was the best toque ever, but then I lost it one day, and I was saddened :/  So, today, I went out in hopes of replacing my beloved toque.  Unfortunately, THERE WAS NO TOQUE IN SIGHT.  Those communists stopped producing my favourite toque and even worst the retarded salesperson made a sly remark at me.  What a jackass.  Because of that, I will never shop at Foot Locker again.  Ever.  YOU JUST LOST A VALUBLE CUSTOMER FAGMOTRONS.  So.. let me explain, why they lost such a valuble customer, such as myself.  I walked into the store, with an intent of browsing for my toque, but before I could even make it past the front shoe racks, some stupid lady in a referee getup asked how I was doing, whereupon I replied, with just fine and asked her how she was doing.  This was a horrible mistake as I let her ask me, 'Do you need any help?' and me, not being able to lie, said 'Yes, I'm looking for a black Nike toque'  She took me to her 'toque' section, which was quite sad really, it had like two toques and like 50 million fagetly looking crossbreed toque caps.  You know what i'm talking about, those new hats that seem to be so hip, which are between a cap and a toque.  Yeah, those are gay up the wazoo, no one likes them, go back to Italia you genos.  Anyway, i explained how i loved my toque so much and that I lost it and am in the process of replacing it, when she replied 'Good one there, buddy' in a condenscending matter.

There are 2 new advertising campaigns out right now that, if nothing else, have at least caught my attention.    First of all, there's the new Guess? girl.  At least I think she's new.  I see her every morning on my way to work, on a bus stop ad.  Have you seen this?  She sort of looks like Claudia Schiffer, very Bridgette Bardot-ish; only she's more like the white-trash trailer park version.

Maybe Guess? is trying to reach the low income denim wearers of America?  Then there's the new 'Pork, the other white meat' campaign.  Which, now that I see these two together, sort of goes with the trailer park girl. But, I digress.  Familiar quotes and phrases have been twisted to serve pork's purpose.  There's 'Go ahead, make my pork' and 'Time flies when you're having pork'.  It's clever I suppose.  Not really very creative, but catchy.    There's only one problem for me with this.  I have a friend with a very colorful vocabulary and he already uses pork as a replacement for another very colorful word.  You, uh, change the p-o-r to f-u-c and, well... you get the picture.

Tho' it's not written by me, I still hope it'll get published/accepted at least.    After work, thought of posting those documents at Lok Fu, but didn't have time to do it.  So I went home and took a rest before going to TST for dinner with Phoebe.  Phoebe lent me her old cell phone, tho' it's not working perfectly, I think it's good enough for a month.  hehehe.. Great! I don't have to waste my bucks on another cell phone.    I called Yusuke today, haven't called him for quite sometime.  I was a little worried about him after he called the other day. Anyway, nice to know that he's doing fine.  COngrats!!!! He's got a high score in TOEFL, a very goood score! COngrats! Something he's really proud of now! Keep it up! Well, he's now 'half' in the top tier Japanese Grad School now (with this score) Keep rolling, Yusuke! You're almost there!!   Thanksgiving:  (1) Cell phone from Phoebe: I was so worried cuz I don't wanna spend money on another mobile phone.  I know I need one before I leave HK in August.  Thanks to the Lord! I've got one from Phoebe!   (2) New York: I was wondering if I should spend money on hotel during my transit stay in New York.  I was worried especially yesterday when I confirmed my tickets.  Well I still haven't made up my mind where to lodge, but I am sure God has heard my prayer, and will be planning the best for me.  Cuz He's been showing me different options.... all I need to do is PRAY!! Will keep you informed!   Thank you Lord!   'Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear.  Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.  Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?' (Matthew 6:25-27)  Today I also read about Jacob in Genesis 32.  He wrestled with God and asked God to bless him.  Then God made Jacob limb, so that he'd be more dependent on God.  I shared some of my thoughts on that with Wing yesterday.  We talked about my exchange year in Ohio.  We both feel that God has deliberately planned this 2nd visit to OU for me.  God is like giving me a second chance to live a different 'life' from last time.  When I first went to Ohio which was three years ago, I dare say, I brought quite a big sum of money with me.  Well, I still tried to spend less for the first couple of months, but after that...um... Anyway, this time I'll be living on a tight budget.  I must say, I don't even know if I could sustain my living with such money.  Well, afterall, I don't wanna ask my family for so much, especially I've graduated for more than a year now.  Well guys! I think the verses in Matthew and Jacob's story reminded me something very important:  (1) God will take care of us. (2) By making us 'poor', we'll rely on God more.  Note: being 'poor', not only financially, can be other aspects.  Anyway, this shows that I gotta rely on God more. And I believe God is showing me his blessings.  Well, afterall, God has provided me this Masters education.  Tuition waiver + assistantship, which worths around HK$ 300,000 a year.  I am sure He'll take care of the rest.  Please continue to pray for me!!"], "gold_label": 1.0}

I will be working an extra 25 hours on top of my normal routine, which I think totally blows.  This is where company loyalty will get you - long, thankless hours with no dinner but peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  That's ok, though, I guess.  Even though Kevin has been working for the last couple of weeks, we are still playing a fair amount of catch up, so the overtime will make it worthwhile.  I'm just a little disappointed I won't be able to do anything else this weekend, really.  I have to get my wedding invitations in the mail next week, but we are still fighting over the guest list.  I very much want to invite everyone in my choir yet Kevin's Mom is completely against it.  I'm not sure why, actually.  Is it the financial burden?  Nope, because that's covered by my parents.  Is it the extra people wandering around her property?  Maybe, but I think that's a cop out.  She refuses to communicate with me about anything, yet whenever I have to go ahead and make a decision, she flips out and starts screaming.  I think she's crazy.\n\nText 2:Instant Karma's Gonna  Got  Me  By Duf Fer  Last night, at poetry group, I workshopped a poem called 'Departure.'

What was even worse was the guy sitting next to me kept raising his hand, which meant the professor had to be looking my way. That was totally annoying. The only amusing thing about the guy next to me was he kept hitting on the girl next to him. It was funny because she was trying to ignore him, despite his attempts to make conversation. Alas, the only thing that amuses me in that class are things like this.  Well anyway, after all that torture, I took a 30 minute nap in the basement of the Main Library like I normally do.

I think it was thought provoking, because of all the people I know, no one's life is more full of stress than hers. In addition to that, she handles it marvelously. I think her little comment was a bit of a reality check. Things could be a lot worse, and even if they were worse, it's something that can be worked through.

What is your most prized material possession?  I have a copy of The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran that my mother gave to my father (may he rest in peace) when they were dating.  I would say if I had to grab one THING in the event of a fire, that would be it.   2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  This is a bizarre thing about me, but I really dont have a lot of my old stuff.  Much of it is still stored at dear old moms, and much of that has been thrown away.  So, I would say that thing I own that I have had the longest is The Prophet.    3. Are you a packrat?  In a way.  I have a hard time discarding magazines.  I have too many CDs and books, but other than that, it all must go.  Although, like Panda, I likes my photos too.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  I really like a clean house.  But, like most men, I really hate what you have to do to have one.  When I lived alone, my space was always spotless.  We have a maid now (don't hate) and that helps, but our house is too small for the stuff we have, so clutter is an issue.  When we have adequate storage space, we will be much better off.     5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  Themes:  'Damn dees people po.'

Something about the simplicity and the depth of poetry that connects.  I found this old favorite of mine by Langston Hughes called  Mother To Son .  It helps me perservere.  It was refreshing to read it again.   Well, son, I'll tell you: Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, And splinters,  And boards torn up, And place with no carpet on the floor-- Bare. But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on, And reachin' landin's, And turnin' corners. And sometimes goin' in the dark Where there ain't been no light. So boy, don't you turn back. Don't you set down on the steps 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard. Don't you fall now-- For I'se still goin', honey, I'se still climbin', And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.\n\nText 2:Well, we're off again.

One night, drunk at a party, BP got mad at me and threw a bottle of Heineken at me (Duf ducked, bottle breezed by).  I ended it because she clearly had an anger management problem.  She called me a lot and even waited for me in my bed one night (scary).  Eventually, we reached an understanding (or so I thought).  One afternoon, I was at home watching Jeopardy (With Alex Trebek - a Canadian) after a vigorous academic schedule.  BP comes down the hall walking out of my roommate's room.    BP:   I just *&^%$# your roommate. Duf:   Who was better? BP:   He was by far. Duf:  That's funny, your mama said I was.  BP remains silent then throws herself at Duf and beats him about the head and neck.  Offending roomate removes BP from the person of Duf.  Eventually, Duf, roommate and BP reach an understanding.   2.  Have you ever lied to spare feelings when breaking up with someone?  No, I pretty much tell the truth.  However, I have broken up with someone from the (edge of the) bed of someone else so that I would not 'cheat.'     3.  Stevie Wonder says 'there is supersitition.'  Discuss.

We actually took the top off the tent to keep it from launching.  I ended up getting quite a sunburn on my face, but in reality I spent the whole day freezing.  I did, however, being the bright girl that I am, wear more clothes than I did yesterday.  Today I wore my favourite brown cotton sari, with lots of warm extras underneath.  A woman in a salwar kameez (this is the outfit you see Indian women wearing, with the long top and the pants underneath) and a dupatta (long scarf) wrapped around her head came up to me and asked me if I was Indian.  I replied I wasn't, and then after a protracted conversation with my friend Krishnapriya in Hindi, turned back to me and told me I was in fact Indian, as she had seen me yesterday in a salwar kameez and today in a sari, and then she told me she was from Pakistan, and very gently suggested to me that I cover my head, 'because it's good.'  Well, it was far too windy for me to try wrapping a wool chaddar (scarf) around my head, but I appreciated her sentiment, and I guess I look Indian enough to fool the Pakistanis if not the Indians.    I also had a further chance to hone my fashion sense and do some further consideration on the whole hip hugger thing.  I'm not sure how to lay out my thoughts in an easy-to-follow format, so I'll try using bullet points.   -Marines : get out of the street clothes and dress uniforms and back in the fatigues.  Just trust me on this one.  Also, if they give you a choice, always go for the black boots, not the brown.   -Big women : just say no to clunky shoes and miniskirts.  Cellulite on calves and ankles is a definite sign that long skirts and pants should take precedence over the miniskirts and the shorts.  Also, no tattoos on the small of your back.. you know, between the fat rolls.  Really, ladies.  Yuck.   -Mullets:  bad for men, suicidal for women.  - Always learn how to walk  successfully in your platform heels/Candies/stilettos before you go out.  Otherwise you look remarkably like an old woman recovering from simultaneous hip, knee, and back surgery.   -If you're selfconscious  about the length of your skirt, it's too short.  - Dressing like a man  does not make fat go away.  It just makes you look fat and butchy.   -Men and flip flops : dangerous ground few can tread.  If your name isn't Biff and you're not carrying a surfboard, reconsider, man, before you do it.  - Microwave tans  are just not all that sexy.  You just look leathered.   -The 'Joey Ramone' look is NOT for women.   To emphasise the seriousness of this, I include for your consideration photographs of the Late Great Joey Ramone.  And I love Joey Ramone, and I'm all for tributes, but girls, wear a button or a t shirt instead of trying to go for the whole look.  And if you have a friend who's heading this way, cut them off at the pass.  Do it for them.  Do it for us.         -In one positive note , I saw a guy wearing what appeared to be a kilt made of olive drab fatigue material, with matching green socks folded neatly over the tops of his black combat boots, and a black t shirt.  You'd think this would have been a nightmare, but he pulled it off quite nicely.  I am not narrowminded about fashion.  To conclude my chapter on fashion, let's recap the whole hip hugger thing.  The problem with hip huggers is that women have hips.  It's okay to have hips.  But when you hug those hips, all that fat that women have on their hips (unless you're completely anorexic or completely toned, and even then, you've got fat) gets squeezed out.  Also, even on skinny girls, there's a belly there that gets squeezed out when the hip huggers go on.  The result is kind of reminscent of a sausage.  Or an older man with a belly who INSISTS his pants are the same size they were in 1958.  You know what I mean?  So in conclusion on the whole hip-hugger thing, I'd have to say that unless you're under 100 lbs, or you have hips like a sixth grade boy, don't do it.  I got some lovely henna on my hand, and we also distributed some books, including Bhagavad gita.  So despite the wind and the sunburn and the general financial failure, in many ways the event was a success.  Hare Krishna.\n\nText 2:I spent all day today helping a friend at the Azalea Festival.  This is Wilmington's premier event of the year.  It has about a 60 year tradition and draws over 100,000 people.  Since we were there all day, I got to see the parade and do a lot of people watching in between keeping the wind from launching our tent.  Since I really don't go out a lot, especially to places where people are (like the mall), I saw a lot of stuff today that I haven't seen before, and since I'm me, I have comments.  But first let's discuss the parade.  I consider myself uniquely qualified to judge a parade.  I've participated in hundreds upon hundreds over a ten year period, all over the Northeast.  Let me tell you, they don't do a parade in NC the way they do it in NY.  A New York parade is all about the firemen.  The boys spend all day starching their uniforms and Armor-Alling the trucks, and put on their nice white gloves and march.  Every town's volunteer fire department marches, each with a hired band or fife/drum/bugle corps to provide their music.  All the trucks are in the parade (you should see the mess when someone has a fire during parade time).  There's very little besides the firemen-a couple of floats, perhaps, and some clowns, but it's all about the bands, the trucks, and the boys.  At the end is a fair (carnival) and a 'bullpen' for the parade participants with free food, and all the firemen get rip roaring drunk.  Today's parade was NOT about the firemen.  It was a lot about pageant queens.  Beauty pageants are hot business here in the south.  Everyone with a cause has a pageant and a queen, and a parade brings every last one of them out.  You got your Little Teen Miss Pecan Harvest, your Shrimp Queen, Pecan Queen, Pecan Princess, Watermelon Queen/Princess/Little Miss/Ambassador.. you got your Little Miss North Brunswick County.  You name the event, you got a queen and her whole court to go with it.  And each of these little darlings, even the four year olds, get a crown and a convertible Corvette to ride on (they perch precariously on the roof and wave).  Without going into my whole aversion to the Jon Benet mentality, let me just say that I hate the whole pageant thing, and this parade had far too much of them.  Then you have your religious floats and groups.  There were about a dozen of these.  You'd never see THAT in NY.   There were some nice things about the parade-I quite enjoyed the old cars (I enjoy anything with an old car in it) and the Saddle Clubs, some of which performed quite nicely.  I like horses.  The horses didn't like the parade much.  There were three Saddle Clubs, two of which were immaculately dressed and one of which looked like a group of refugees from the Beverly Hillbillies.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they were (all three of them) racially segregated.  I might very well have been the only person who noticed it and almost positively the only person there who cared, but that sort of thing still rubs me wrong.   I saw some llamas pulling a cart.  I never knew they could be used as draft animals, if a cart counts as a draft animal.  There were various little groups of children in shorts  to which I paid little attention beyond remembering my friend Greg's recent post about parades.  You'll have to go to his site to dig up his post, but let me say after watching this parade, I agree wholeheartedly with everything he said.  As a side note, knock-knees and shorts don't exactly mix.  Then you have your dance schools.  The only ones of these I like are the cloggers.  Clogging, if you've never seen it, is sort of like a redneck Irish step dancing, but I like it anyway.  Don't let me forget at least a dozen JROTC groups, all of which I hope learn how to march decently before the graduate highschool.  Rolling Thunder was there, impressive as always with their drill team (they look very nice in their outfits.. do you call them uniforms?) and this year the Shriners forfeited their cute little cars for a little choo choo train that looked like a runaway from Mr. Rogers' Neighbourhood.  It was cute.  I bypassed the rest of the parade.. mostly because I was really, really sick of the pageant girls.  I will make one comment about the few highschool bands I saw: they all sounded better than they looked.  None of them could march or keep a line worth a flip.  On to people watching, and Mr. Blackstone, who makes comments about fashion.  Let me share with you some fashion truths I learned today.  Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever been or claimed to be, fashionable.  However.  A blind person could have spotted the following fashion faux pas at 100 yards in the fog:  1.  Anyone more than 10 pounds overweight should not wear hiphuggers with short shirts.  The belly is not meant to hang over the pants, people.  There's nothing sexy about that.    2. Hip huggers ought to be outlawed.  They look like crap on just about everyone.  They make your butt look big, create love handles even if you don't have any, and they just look dumb.  And flare legs were bad the FIRST time around.  3.  Hot pink stiletto-heel boots go with NOTHING.  4.  It will never, ever be fashionable to have 3' of dark roots to your blonde hair.  5.  'Goth' is  supposed  to be anorexic.  Trust me, when you're pushing 275 pounds, it doesn't look 'Goth'.. it just looks bad.  6. Blue nailpolish: no.   7. Kudos to the Amish, who never compromise their fashion principles regardless of their social environment.  I really liked the lady's pinafore, too.  I would have bought it if she'd have sold it to me.  And the bonnet.  Go on, laugh.  I liked the bonnet.  7. The rest of you little tramps, put some friggin clothes on.  I saw girls today wearing skirts that were barely underwear.  It was about 40 with the wind chill.  They just looked stupid, and if I was their mother.. okay... I'm going to stop here and just breathe for a bit.  8.  And if you ARE their mother, shame on you for how YOU look.  I saw you, and no wonder they dress like that.  You've set them a crappy example.  All in all though, it was a pretty good day.   urlLink"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Abstract:  'Quality assurance and online delivery are hot topics in universities, yet until recently discussions of each have had little to do with each other. These spheres of activity in universities may not have interacted very closely in the past. This paper describes current debates within quality assurance and online delivery policies within universities and proposes four themes as ways to consider these debates and their relationships with each other. Arising from this discussion are possible research agendas that are likely to increase in importance as universities' use and reliance upon online technologies increases and as the stakes for ensuring quality are raised.'

What is the baseline of mathematical knowledge among students in the rural United States? Poverty in nonmetropolitan areas exceeds that in metropolitan areas (Jolliffe, 2002), and, for this reason, one might reasonably suspect that mathematics achievement in rural schools is depressed as compared to the national average. Is this really the case? This Digest assesses the best evidence available and concludes with recommendations for further action, based in part on conclusions reached by a national effort to develop new research about mathematics education in rural places."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I'm now pretty sure that the WAP11 does notwork reliable with Airport cards, with the TCP/IP stack in OS X, or both. The easy-to-reproduce syptom was that I could send veryshort mail (where the message all fit into one TCP packet) but could not send longer messages. Using tcpdump, I couldsee that the second packet of the message was simply not going through. When I switched to Ethernet, it worked fine.And, after I fixed my Airport, that worked fine. I hope no one followed my earlier message about using the WAP11. If so, I apologize.

In the Network system pref, to enter an ASCII passwordfor a non-Airport base station, you have to surround it withquotation marks even though you don't use them for Airportbase stations.

They have done something to this computer I just know it. I have this crazy plan though that when I finish my mother's comissioned painting I am going to buy a big ass hard drive and start a new... even if it takes NIGHTS to complete. I need fucking order. I believe that I am turning into those anal organising types, which is funny since I used to snort speed. Anyways back on track, today I woke up with an upset stomach that set me way back in the chores department... I just don't have the passion to work in futile hope in this place... I just can't do it every day, I need a fucking life. I watched Sex and the City tonight, and I was highly amused by the whole 'Sex' part of it. I like sex, and I am highly realistic on what sex is and what it isn't. Sex is not love, and it's not an indication that you are in love, or that you have fallen out of love.  Sex is just a basic human need to get off, it's a cocktail of hormones and affection. You would love for the person that you are with is someone you like, because sex with affection means no barries, it means freedom. Gee I sound like I should be writing for a column in New York doesn't it? All I need is the horse face. I ate too much yesterday and I know that's probably why I got the bug, I just fel nauseous and vomited a little in the morning, when I told the others Vicki immediatly and deap pan said 'You could be pregnant' and I'm like...hmm.. no I just bled two days ago and CB is infertile thanks to the many drugs he inhales into his system. They concurred in merry laughter and I was left wondering...wow.. can you imagine if he is truly infertile? like Tom Cruise? It would somewhat make me feel weird.. not bad just weird like.. cool..weird... I am truly okay with that. Been is practising the guitar, we had a night of trashy TV starting with that Newlyweds show with Jessica I-have-the-brain-capacity-of-a-fruit-fly Simpson...

Moreover, some of my so-called friends knew my EJ address so I didn't want to see what would be a not-so-pretty picture of the 'friendship' side of my life.  But since they don't know this web log or that they don't know that it's me who's also keeping this weblog, I might as well answer the questions here. So here goes...    1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?   The funny thing is that I don't even remember  ever  having a best friend. I've had so many friends in our village, from school, at work, everywhere! But I never thought nor even tried to keep a best friend. One or two would turn out to be very close friends of mine, but none ever became a 'best' friend.   I don't rate my friends either. To say that someone is 'best' is also to delegate the others to the 'good' or 'better' or 'bad' categories, and I am not that cruel. Sorry.    2. Are you still in touch with this person?   With some very close friends, yes.   There was the closest one who knew about my darkest secrets, but it turned out that we were both having our personal issues then, so as time went by and we moved on our separate ways, we just lost contact until we came to the point when we would just treat each other as a mere acquantance.    3. Do you have a current close friend?   Yes. But still our closeness does not resemble that of 'best' friends where you just tell each other stuff about yourselves, your days and interests. Somehow, my friendships here has this tinge of jealousy or competition among everyone. It's really weird. When we get together, I feel as if everyone is just trying to outdo each other--who has a boyfriend, a fabulous job, bigger paycheck.   I've also got friends I only get in touch with on the Internet. Now, these people are really very nice. We've never even met, but it seems like we've known each other for years. We share stuff about ourselves and our daily struggles, as well as our joys and interests on our online diaries.     4. How did you become friends with this person?   From college. The others, on the net through movie sites.    5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?   I don't recall. If I've chucked a friend, it's mostly because I didn't want him/her to be my friend anymore. I'd keep in touch with someone I want to keep come hell or high water."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I'll put up a quiz today, but then I'll move them to Tuesdays as a standing feature. Feedback is great on something like this so we can see what everyone else's list would be. Also, if you have any suggestions for list topics let me know and I'll put them up (they could potentially be about anything), or if you want a day to do some different running feature, knock yourself out! So here goes the first Friday Five:   Top 5 Music Videos  5. 'Imagine' by John Lennon 4. 'In Bloom' by Nirvana 3. 'Been Caught Stealing' by Jane's Addiction 2. 'Take on Me' by Aha 1. 'Hazard' by Richard Marx haha, just kidding 1. (for real) 'No Surprises' by Radiohead  It was tough; runners up include Movies by Alien Ant Farm (they do great spoofs of classic movies like Willy Wonka and Edward Scissorhands) and 'Hey Ya' by and 'Miss Jackson' by Outkast, but 'Hey Ya' is pretty much a reworking of 'In Bloom.' There are other bands I like a lot more, but I based it soley on cool videos. I'm sure there are great ones I'm forgetting...like anything directed by Paul Hunter or Spike Jonze. Weezer and Bjork videos come to mind.\n\nText 2:So, Arizona it is!  Jon and I just got back from visiting Arizona last night and made the decision to move there.

But I won't try to fool you into thinking the professors impacted this decision at all...once I saw the plethora of Mexican restaurants, I was sold.  My brother John showed us around the area; everything is so new and clean and, most importantly, WARM.  Then Sat. we took a road trip up to Sedona, which is just a couple hours away.     It's a really beautiful area with all these mountains and red rocks.  We did a little mountain biking, checked out an art fair (it's a really artsy place), and drove to a winery (yeah, a winery in Arizona...not bad, though).   We stayed in Flagstaff Sat. night at this great hotel where you get FREE DRINKS from 5:30-7:30, free massages, and free breakfast the next am (Embassy Suites...and yes it is a national thing, we asked!).  What's amazing about AZ is you pass through a different ecosystem like every 20 min. you drive; Flagstaff is just 2 hours away from Phoenix and still had snow in the mountains.  I'm really jazzed about all the trips we can take from Phoenix...Mexico, Vegas, Southern Cali...all not too far at all.  Good times...and all visitors welcome."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Well, my return from Hiroshima ended up being quite an adventure as well. Having been warned of the approaching typhoon, we were concerned about the fate of our evening flight.  We therefore called ANA several times throughout the day and were eventually told we could call at 6:30 to learn more.  Having a 7:10 flight meant we could not wait until then to leave for the airport.  When we arrived at the airport we claimed some seats and read the notice that said they would be checking the weather at 6 O'clock.  At 6 they still didn't know and said that they would check the weather again at 7 and let us know.  Getting a little concerned, we started questioning the ANA ladies about our options.  All of us obviously wanted to know if we would be making it to work the next morning as nenkyu(paid leave) is running low and already in the negatives for some.      Apparently, the earlier flight from Hiroshima was routed through Nagoya and had been sitting there fore quite some time because of the typhoon.  Having had the typhoon completely skip us (don't know how it happened as it went right past us) we were pretty confident our flight would leave.  Unfortunately, the weather in Sendai was awful and although the plane might make it to Hiroshima, there is a law in Japan that says no flight can take off after 9 or 9:30 so there was no way we were going to make it home.  We wish they had just been honest from the start instead of giving us maybe over and over again.      Our options...they were dealing with us separately from everyone else I guess because we weren't just accepting what they said.  We weren't content to just change our ticket for the following morning and disappear for the night.  When they finally told us we could get on a flight to Tokyo, we had just missed the plane that would have gotten us there in time to catch the last shinkansen to Sendai.  We were then told we could still go on the last flight from Hiroshima to Tokyo but would only be able to take a night train or bus from there or stay in the city for the night.  All of those options would have been at our own expense. None of us were looking to spend much of anything.    They then told us we could stay at the airport hotel but that would have been 8,000 yen for each of us. About $80 US was more than we wanted to spend.  We told them we couldn't afford it and so they tried to find us somewhere less expensive.  They found us a place that would give us a discount rate of 3500 yen each but we would have to take the bus back into the city and round trip that would have added another 2000 yen each.  We still weren't happy. We asked to stay in the airport all night but they told us the airport closed so that wasn't possible.  We then tried our final option which was to have them call the airport hotel and ask if 4 of us could stay in a double which meant we would each be paying 4000 yen for the night.  We were quite lucky that the hotel agreed as breaking the rules is usually something not tolerated at all or even considered in Japan.  The room ended up being quite large and the nicest place we stayed in by far.  We all slept quite comfortably and were able to be on the 11:25 flight the next morning.

'What's got your brain all tied up, mr.tim?/So who is this girl?  No relationship or girl trouble has happened in my corner;  the past posts were in response to trying to figure out something that I talked about with a female friend.  Well more like, I was trying to figure out what she tried to explain to me, as I tried to take mental notes.  My head was tilted, my eyes looking up as the mind was working and churning to understand her perspective.  I gotta figure out SOME way to treat the women in my life/future well.  Fine fine, I admit right now, it's just me mum.  ****  Now, as for what's been bugging me these days, the same frustrating thoughts have been entering.  I'm 23 years old, and I feel like I'm going nowhere with my life.  People say, 'You're young!  Lighten up!  Viva la vida loca! You're too hard on yourself!'  And I agree, I can be hard on myself.  But these days, it's a bit deeper than that.  My relationship with Christ has been rocky for the past two years, because I just didn't try to fulfill my thirst for life with knowing Him.  I guess that's where that post about the marriage analogy came in.  I've been hit in my soul with passages like John 15:5, the book of Romans, and the book of Matthew.  I recall to mind phrases like 'You have forsaken your first love,' 'God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to His purpose,'  'Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your soul,'  'Remember the Creator in the days of your youth,'  'The conclusion, when all has been heard, is to fear God and keep His commandments,'  'trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight,' and of course, 'love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your mind, all your soul, all your strength.'  They pummel at my 'cheatin' heart'  that has fallen 'out of love' with God.  Thankfully, I'll never fall out of His grace, and with that promise alone He's sustained me and proved to me that He is the author/perfector of my faith.  But, I've habitually distracted myself with so many things throughout my teen and college years that they've laid claim on my attention span, on my lack of time management ability, and on any sense of direction in life.  I've lived the same wastrel late night/late morning ritual since second semester senior year, and I have to get out.  This is beyond beyond being 'hard on myself,'  because that was mere frustration without direction.  Now, I'm in the process of getting out, but it isn't as frustrating as it is confusing.  I left grad school partially because I had no assurance in my heart that biomedical engineering was my future career.  I wanted to be in music!  I wanted to be artistic!  I feel like I've duped myself over the past couple of years into thinking that I can be a musician, a real professional performer, a real multimedia artist in this multimedia age.  It's a long time coming, but I'm finally admitting and hurting my ego in the process that I don't have any special talent that stands out, enough to make my living off of performance and recording.  Furthermore, I figured, since I have passion for these things, I'll pursue them accordingly.  What naivete, for I still ended up browsing the web for useless information,  browsing the channel for useless stimulation, browsing the music for useless pinings to BE a similar creator of music.  But did I practice for any real goal?  And when I have musical responsibilities and goals that ARE in sight, have I truly worked hard to prepare myself?  No, and that absence of action pointed me to say that it's not simply a matter of motivation, it's also a matter of an undisciplined mind and heart that has gotten all that it's wanted and never learned how to provide for itself.  And so I face myself in this time, and I turn to the path ahead of me.  I find that it isn't a path, it's road so wide and long that it's a desert:  flat, omnidirectional, barren, unyielding of any clues to the next destination in life.  I have a guide leading the way, but sometimes the wind burns my eyes.  Sometimes the pretty ladies and videogames and, to ruin the analogy, promises of instant emotional gratification convince me to pause and ignore the guide.  To peel myself away To peel myself away My destination's telling me To peel myself away.  I don't know where I'm going I don't know where I'm going Promises of blessing, but I just Don't know where I'm going.  My guide says He'll take me there My guide says He'll take me there I'll take His word for it My guide says He'll take me there"], "gold_label": 1.0}

When you see the giant list of Phobias, it's hard to imagine they left any out , but mine are very obscure. The first one is the irrational fear that I've just walked into the wrong bathroom, characterized by repeatedly poking my head out the door to check the sign and occasionally leaving the stall door slightly open so I can see urinals.  (I realize some of you may not have wanted to know that, but when I'm ranting it's hard to stop) My second and much worse fear is talking to answering machines.  They're horribly misnamed, because they don't answer.  They talk, beep, and then just listen silently.  The worst part is, unlike people, they remember everything they hear perfectly.  Once you've said it, there's no taking it back. So, normally, if I call someone and the answering machine picks up, I hang up immediately in fear.  Sometimes, though, you just have to reach someone.  In these cases I'll leave a message.  I'll start talking, but the silence on the other end makes me uncomfortable, and I start rambling to fill the silence, until I've forgotten what I was gonna say, at which point I start mumbling and hang up.  After I've hung up, I realize how awful it sounds and call back in order to apologize for the first message and say what I need to say, but this doesn't always work as planned either.  So, anyone I call and leave a message for thinks I'm a gibbering idiot, and it's all the fault of those dram answering machines.

CORRINNE CLEGG HALES Critical Care  She could be a puppet, blue strings trailing from the backs of her hands, her index finger, her nose, her mouth, even her crotch,   but her wrists are strapped to the metal  bed rails, also her ankles, and white tape  covers her mouth like a burglar's gag   keeping the respirator tube in place.  If she could see herself like this, splayed out  under a thin sheet surrounded   by shower curtains and stainless steel  and everything on wheels, she might laugh. But she is thinking now of learning to swim   in a slow, dirty river, remembering  how her brother dared her to dive  between his legs, and when she did,   how he clenched her head with his knees  and held her there thrashing,  hitting at him through the water   until there were knives in her lungs. It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.  This is all so normal for them they strap people down and knock people out  and string people up like this     every day. They do it to save them.  The woman waits. She thinks she has forgotten how to breathe. She hears  someone gasping from a bed  behind the curtainloud, clumsy breaths far apart, the strange deep brand of breathing   that the dying doas if to prove  they can still do it, as if the air itself  might shake them back to life.\n\nText 2:It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Anyhoo, I've got a few things on my mind and I often stop to think and reflect about the things that I have seen, experienced and hope for the future. I've always been a 'heavy thinker' so much so that my mom told me when I was young that one day I might grow up to have an ulcer. (All right! Something to look forward to!) I had a very 'heavy thinking' week this past week. I get bogged down with people's expectations of me, my expectations of others, and my fears and insecurities. I've realized that this isn't a good time. I don't want to think about those things so much anymore. This is easier said than done, but I'm trying. Take a deep breath, trust in God and just let it go.   Sorry to get a little heavy on you, but I feel better. Thanks.  And on to the F5:  1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   I think being a kind, loyal soul would be nice. Oh and the effing hot chic bass playah this town has evah seen...rock.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   At this moment: don't worry, be happy.    3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   Moving past bad relationship moments and finding joy in loving someone.    4. What about the past ten years?   Oof...there are a lot of big and small victories over the past 10 years, can't point out just one. I would say the most meaningful moments have come from relationships - finding love, enduring love, losing love and starting all over again. It's humbling and empowering in the same minute.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?   Don't be afraid to jump in with both feet.

I just got my email address of abe@ihumpmypillow.com for this blog, but I'm just going to trash that one now since I won't need it and nobody has emailed me to that account anyway. So it's not going to be used anymore, don't email me there. So I'm going to move all my email dealings to this account instead of my hotmail and yahoo accounts. I'm going to see if I can forward all my old yahoo and hotmail emails over to this account so I have copies of all my important old emails on those accounts. 1 gig of email space will be SOOOO nice after always running out of room every other day with measly little 5 meg accounts.  Since it's shitty out today, I decided to beta test a MMORPG call  urlLink Ryzom . It's a free open beta test, so it'll be a good diversion without having to pay the monthly fee for now. I think it would be an alright game, but true to its beta-ness, I constantly get high ping and disconnects from the server 5 minutes or so into every play session. Then I have to load the game back up (which takes like 2 minutes) just to have it happen again. So there, I found a bug already.   The rest of this weekend was a lot of fun. Soccer practice on Friday night was a lot better than my first practice. I think I'll have a hold of coaching in another week or so. And my team won their first game 7-2. They played awesome.

Derek was also at Jeffy's place Friday and earlier Saturday, but by the time Sean and I got over there on Saturday night, he had already left. When UWSP is in session, all I got to say is that going out downtown there has plenty of very nice 'sights' wearing tight clothes. I'm trying to figure out why when we were in school there all we did was bitch about going to these bars when now it sucks when you have to leave. And a night out in Point can be finished without a good trip to Taco Bell. Two grilled stuft burritos and I was out for the night. A little bit of foosball, a few drinks, and plenty of great looking women around always makes for a great night.  But now I'll shut up and go play in my new Gmail account.

Law an official position in Rome, naming the former Boston archbishop who resigned in the sex abuse scandal as head of a basilica.  Law will have the title archpriest of St. Mary Major Basilica, a largely ceremonial post often given to retired prelates.  The 72-year-old Law resigned Dec. 13, 2002, to quell an outcry over his handling of sex abuse cases.  He moved from Boston and became resident chaplain at a convent in Maryland, although he retained his membership on nine Vatican congregations and councils, traveling frequently to Rome. He attended a number of the events during celebrations for John Paul's 25th anniversary as pontiff in October.\n\nText 2:Break my bones, and mind, break my soul cruel world.

I'm really behind by about three chapters (or lessons) from almost everyone (except perhaps those who didn't take up econ in undergrad) so I'm working double-time to keep up. We scheduled our mid-terms for July 23 and thank God, we'll stick to lectures next Saturday.  Doji and I decided to start getting active this year, aside from jogging in a nearby park, we'd get ourselves into badminton. We bought a pair of rackets last Saturday at Toby's and headed off to PICC grounds yesterday morning for a game of badminton at a rented court.  PICC is quite a happening place on weekend mornings. It has loads of people who just want to be active even if just for once a week. You can play badminton, tennis, jog, bike and join the free aerobic classes, from tai chi to tae bo.   I finally saw  The Hulk  last night. It would have been really good if not for the awful CGI. For me, the best scenes are those that do not involve Hulk.

However, I have to ask if it was ok to shift because even if I had already two terms' worth of residency, I only enrolled oficially in the first term. Oh well, I think that if I have to, I would completely drop my program since it is completely pointless to continue with it. I'm just crossing my fingers that I'd be allowed into a course that I am sure is more appropriate both for my professional and academic backgrounds, as well as for my career goals.  I was with Bernard for coffee, which extended to light dinner of dimsum at a Chinese resto at Robinson's Ermita.

It was a good movie, but I'm going to go on a little rant right now.  Roger Ebert was right about the flatness of the story and characters this time around. Indeed the characters are technically supposed to span the whole series; however, none of the characters bessides maybe the hobbits Pippin and Merry show any real flair or depth. Sam and Frodo were really annoying the fuck out of me. I'll just come out and say it... Sam is a wiener and he probably wants Frodo to... well... see his wiener. I'm not even sure why they included the stuff on Arwen. Her role in the movie was pretty pointless, because Aragorn was so flat as a character. He would have been much cooler if they did more on his identity as a ranger versus his identity as a king. Give him conflict like Smeagol / Gollum had in the 2nd movie. Gimli was a character that had personality, but no air time to show it off.  I personally think that the Lord of the Rings' greatness lies in the overall narrative, not the specific details. It's a good story with great special effects. I think the battle in the 3rd movie had a bit more tension than in the 2nd one. I think that of similar battles... the one in  The Empire Strikes Back , which they kind of rip off is better.  Anyway... that movie is more of a B+ / A- movie for me. It didn't reek of WOW like other movies I've seen.  Ok... so I just had breakfast and lunch combined in a 2 hr span of time while watching  I Love Lucy ,  A Team , VH1, and infomercials.

Well, maybe not all but some who works closely to me. Hence, the topics we talked about could range from nothing to personal. My weakness is I trust people easily and I open up to people quite a lot. Although not all but three knows that I am a non-hetero, the other dilemmas in my life would often be the topic of our conversation, and they as well sometimes talk about their problems though honestly, I am no good with advice. Most of them are young married people, so apart from our age and our similar taste in movies or music, the coupling life is not something I am qualified to chip in my two cent\u2019s worth. And I rarely do. But the problems with my fellow \u2018friends\u2019 is that they take my life into their hands and comments away at all and everything. One of them. M is recently married and despite being the eldest in the family, from her stories sometimes u can tell that she is one hell of a spoiled brat. But, since she is the eldest, she assumes the role of the matured sister to me. I hate it. But the so called friendship continues. Until Friday.  We had our usual conversations and the topic was whether ur colleague is also ur friend. M criticised me, indirectly, that I do not judge well. I couldn\u2019t tell who is a colleague and who is a friend. I was hurt. Still am. I decided there and then that whatever after this, she would only be a colleague then. No more assistance in anything outside work.   Came home from work, and I remembered another friend from work whom I go out to dinner with sometimes,Y. Is she a friend or a colleague? I couldn\u2019t decide. There was one dinner which ended with an argument, Y said she was not obliged to tell me anything coz I am a mere colleague. That hurt too. Badly. I didn\u2019t have the heart to speak to her and no more dinner after that until she came asking if I wanna go out for another dinner with her.   Ladee said I am being childish. M said that to me also before. Something about me being overly sensitive when I shouldn\u2019t. Shouldn\u2019t I? And even if I did, why would that be any business of them? Most of all, M didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t have any right to say anything like that to me.   Sent sms to Ladee that day saying that I finally realised I don\u2019t have any friends in the department.  I was very upset but had to control my emotions and maintained my professionalism becoz I was still on site. And I had to maintained my leader composure. But inside, my heart was crying and flooded with tears by the time I came home.   I don\u2019t know if there is anything I should do or change after that. Or I should just forget about it and move on. And pretend nothing happened.   Reversing the thing around, what is my judgement on these people. Do I treat them as friends? Do I value them more that mere accomplice in work ? Maybe that is what I should concentrate on. Thinking of looking up for Criteria To Be A Friend To Someone. Maybe in  a while. I\u2019ll add the result in upcoming entries.   Be Objective, jL. BE OBJECTIVE!!!!!!\n\nText 2:Well my grandad is back home now and he looks great - tho my granny will not let him nap in his chair anymore :) Which has in turn meant that he sleeps great at night. Go figure. But it's kind of odd now, it's like we've been given a second chance but in a surreal weird kind of way. When I see him now I can't help but think that he might not have made it. It's so morbid :( So he gets extra hugs and kisses all the time now.   We did a little shopping for the grandparents over the weekend and checked to make sure he was getting on all right. Then we mostly stayed in this weekend. Very hot around here - humid etc.. I hate going to the pool on the weekend because of the crowds - no fun to swim when all you're really doing is dodging innertubes and splashy kids. So we go later in the evening during the week and practically have it all to ourselves. Anyway, so we rented some videos. Avoid Solaris at all costs. That is an hour and a half I'll never get back. Horrible film and even George Clooney's naked bum did nothing for me. There was very little I wanted to rent this weekend so I ended up getting pretty much all shite movies. Kangaroo Jack could have been funnier if Disney had done it. There were a few chuckles but it was mostly shite. I've got Jurassic Park 3 and Die Another Day left to watch. Dunno if I'm all that enthused about either.  What else is happening... Not much... Had a lovely chat with an old friend over the weekend which was nice. I love it when that happens. Took the kidlet for a haircut which turned out rather nice despite my inability to convey what kind of style I wanted to see on her. Hairdressers usually intimidate me. Even Meechie somewhat. My best friend and I still feel silly if I ask him to do my hair a certain way. But as I don't get to have him as my stylist very often it's not really an issue.   I also think I may be losing my mind a little. Friday, I got out of the shower and dried off etc, got dressed. Went to work, wondered in passing why I had such a tremendous wedgie. Sorted it out when I got to my office and went about my routine. Went to the caf for brekkie, came back with the same wedgie and then it hit me, I had put my knickers on backwards. What a dolt. Then this morning I got dressed flitted about the house getting ready to go to work when I realised I had put my shirt on inside out. I thnk I might be slightly mad, but I think I'm going to call myself eccentric if I go out in public with my knickers on backwards and my shirt inside out."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I'm having a nightmare of a time getting Radio Shack to fix my cell phone. I gave them the phone on the 15th of march to repair and I've never seen it since. Everytime I call over there or show up at the store I get a different answer from someone. Today's saga included screaming at a Customer Service Representative just to get him to pick up a phone and find out where my cell phone is.  The answer : in Texas, still being repaired. See, this is different from Friday when I was told the phone was repaired and en route to Falls Church, Va. Sigh. In better news, last night's Dirty Three show was amazing. To say the band performed 'live' is an understatement. They owned that stage. Mick Turner is one amazing drummer!

But I still haven't seen a Get Bus commercial.  But there's this one that I know Scott loves where this lady says,'Yesterday my phone got 'chut' off.'  It's hilarious.

That would be rock bottom for me.  But I have come up with a whole new plan.  I just have to get my parents to take the bait.  Tell me what all of you think.  I want to go back to school for Radiology full time, and get a part time job to cover my rent, car payment and insurance.  I would take out school loans for tuition, but ask my mom very nicely to cover my other bills until I get finished.  How's that sound?  I mean she is actually getting off a lot cheaper than if I asked her to pay for my school.  She paid for two years of IVCC, but that's nothing.  So basically I am cutting her a deal.  Six kids and only one of them who wants to go to college?  That's chump change to her.  I think it sounds like a sweet deal.  But we will see what she has to say.  I will keep you posted.  Cross your fingers for me.  Ok, I am about to freak out in here.  It's so loud.  First there are two asian women speaking their native language.  I could never, ever live in a foreign country.  It would drive me crazy.  Then there is this lady in here talking to a baby, and if her voice gets any higher I think my ear drums may shatter.  I mean she is up in the dog whistle tones.  Shut up!!!  She is like one of those cheesy nice people, that are always like HIIIII!!!!  and THAAAANK YOU.....and you just want to tell her to shut up and stop being so damned nice.  Then she was saying how quiet the baby was.  Obviously she blocked out it's crying for 20 minutes.  I need a nice quite library to sit in and play on the computer.  Or better yet, I need my own computer.  Donations are being accepted at this time.  Ok, I am done venting.  Did I medicate myself today???  I think so!  What the hell??\n\nText 2:'When love turns bad, it is like watching the Sugar Plum Fairy turn into a machete wielding terrorist.'   HAHA!!  That quote is hilarious.

I think I am considered the 'class clown' at work!  But I like it!  I love to make jokes and make my co-workers laugh!  It's really the only way to keep my sanity in that place sometimes!    So I was glad to see that Cory finally blogged again!  Geez, I thought you disappeared.  You need to send me some more pictures of Madeline.  She probably looks so different now!  And thank you for praying for me, I guess I should be doing a little more of that myself!  I guess I am kind of expecting things to just kind of fall into place.  And we all know that's not going to happen!    I want to see Chain Saw Massacre.  I just saw a preview for it, and it looks good.  I am always up for a horror flick!  As long as I am not watching it alone.  Then I get all freaked out, I am afraid to even move from whatever spot I watched the movie from!  And I think that hiding under the blankets will protect me!

I found a shirt in my closet that still has the tags on it!  I didn't even know I had it!  So I am sure I could have done with out it.

I thought it was going to be extra-dry Brit humour (notice the extra 'u' in humour) with a dash of skullduggery.

Imagine my surprise when Ricky Gervais turned out to be nothing like that.  While I liked the movie 'Office Space' this show beats the living crap out of it.  Excellent stuff.  Add one more show to the pile of shows that are the exception to the rule.  I'll be buying this and Series 2 in no time.   Favorite bits:  -  'Get the guitar.'  -  'That's good.  I'll give her an 'A.'  -  'Biting...biting.'  -  'Why're you in so early?  Did you shit the bed again?'  -  'Who all has seen this picture?  Joan, you don't even have a computer...'

Other than my inanities, it was mostly coffee talk.  I don't think I'll get as many hours as I'd like to work, judging by the training schedule. So won't make as much I guess.

They're also pretty strict about attire - no earrings, minimal jewellry etc. Oh wells, not that I have any outstanding piercings anyways...And praise God, the job's starting 1 week later than scheduled, on Dec 9, so that means I get to go Church Camp! Woopee! (woopee mostly 'coz I get to surf hehe....)  Anyways, those were the highlights. Hope things work out with colleagues!

But anhway, thursday afternoon i will be happy and smiley JO (or as happy and smiley as I get, ha ha), and I will be until parents evening, when meine mutti is gonna turn the tables on that teacher whose name I can't remember, and i don't remember what she said to me yesterday either. It's all done and dusted.  So, basically I went back to bed having got up for breakfast, and slept in until about  10am, got up and wandered around for a bit. Had lunch at 12,  toastie cheese!!!  Um, then did a bit more of nothing, then watched neighbours, then put some very loud Eric Clapton on in my lounge, until my mum came home. She actually suprised me today, cos she thought I was actually ill, wheraas my dad got suss straight away (usually he doesn't pay any attention to my 'illnesses', but today he came to 'chat' cos he knew I wasn't ill). However, he wasn't cross or nething, I just said that I was entitled to take days off now and then, and he said as long as I am not gonna start doing it all the time, like a certain other member of my family. Ahem. So yeah., I oh crap. no. I was about to say I have just come back form my music lesson and am cooking my tea, when I suddenly remeber that I put my potato in the oven, and never took it out again.

OH MY GOD HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?' the last time she knew for sure i was still in school was when she was a teacher's aid and i was an 8TH GRADER!  GOD REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE AN 8TH GRADER? to be at the highest post in elementary hierarchy? the ones all the younger kids wanted to hang out with? life was just so much simpler then, with not much to worry about except the beginning stages of adolescence when you're starting to figure out what kind of friends you want to have and how you want them to define you, and then looking forward to passing a high school entrance exam and eventually graduating to begin again at a new school! and OH THE DREAMS we dreamt for our lives in the future, which seemed so far away, felt far more reachable back then than they do now.   just listening to my sister and her 3 friends' conversation in the car was enough to bring me back 11 years. tin and her best friend, josephine, were talking about something girly, while the two boys, raneil (who's sitting shotgun) and j.j. are discussing how they wanna find summer jobs after graduation. raneil's like, 'why do you wanna work at KFC for? how much do you think you're gonna get paid?' and j.j. shoots back with, 'raneil, man, if i work full-time that's like $250 a week!!!' i remember when i worked at universal studios after high school and $178 a week (net) brought the greatest joy to my life!!! and then they go on to discuss which high schools they wanna attend and why, which leads to living on their own when high school is done. UY! they both just sounded so sure of their plans. this is what i want to happen and that's that. it made me laugh to remember how we used to talk this way about our futures; 'after high school, i'll be in college majoring in chemical engineering, and then after graduation i'll work for NASA , and then i can get married.' that would mean i would've been married...last year. but THAT'S how i used to think and i know a lot of us had the same kind of vision about our lives.  and here we all are, 12 years after elementary school. this isn't exactly what i envisioned i would be in a dozen year's time but i think i've accepted the fact that things don't always turn out the way you plan them. i'm still waiting (more like hoping) for a lot of things to happen to me and God-willing, i'll be a lot more satisfied with myself in a few years. until then, the dreaming and the visions don't cease. here's to another 12 years to wait and see..."], "gold_label": 0.0}

From  urlLink Zenit News Agency - The World Seen From Rome :    'The temptation to judge others is the greatest obstacle in listening to God, says preacher of the Pontifical Household.   Capuchin Father Raniero Cantalamessa made that comment today in reference to John Paul II's affirmation Sunday, when the Pope said at his Angelus address: 'To listen to the Word of God is the most important thing in our lives.'   Father Cantalamessa told Vatican Radio: 'In addition to the external obstacles imposed by the rhythm of modern life, there is an even more dangerous noise: the one which impedes our hearts from listening to the Word of God when judging others.'   This attitude 'makes us judges who judge the whole world. This silent 'noise' of the heart must be silenced in our minds -- at times even with violence,' he said.   'Enough, enough of this sort of reasoning, of complaints!' the priest said. He said people must tell themselves: 'I want to read the Word of God, I want to listen to the Word of God, I want to repeat within me the Word of God.'   It is an exercise that helps 'to pass from useless, noisy, egoistic thoughts to thoughts that come from God,' he added.'\n\nText 2:The problem is, we're like so far away from Jeremiah that a simple phone call costs the world.

Big bother. It doesnt really hurt me because I know that going back to school perhaps wasnt the answer. I have had the shittiest week, the shittiest shift was last night where I practically was crucified in the mercy stakes of Jezebel Queen of the Harpies. Sorry a flashpoint just broke into my head and I have to verbally express this: How dare Smite think that I was to be her friend after what she did to me that day? What right does the higher powers of that godforsaken place have, to go on a warpath? So we failed a Company Customer Service test (again), and here I am laughing at their own unbelievable approach to that, you know what they did? They took away our free tickets, our one perk that keeps most of us there. And they tighten our necks with strings of unnecessary and harsh punishments for the littlest of things. Why dont they just stop hiring 16 years olds who dont give a fuck whether they have a job or not? Why do people need to have that fucking belief that they are higher and thus mightier than the masses they allocate to be beneath them? Why do they need to believe that their shit dont stink? I am so sorry but all the answers to those questions are NO fucking right, hierarchy is just that, a word and a situation that is so outdated and so beneath our progress as a human species. Its just a job, deal with it, life is a series of grey and more grey, there is no more black and white. If you choose to believe that there is, then welcome misery and war. And for holding onto that belief I fucking hate, fucking abhor and detest you. I really do. Thanks for slowing down evolution , you dumb fuck.  Listening to:  Assisting you in plugging holes.

AMAZING! i've been totally crabby lately...i need to stop that...no fun...no fun at all... we're going to mom and dad's tomorrow for mikey's birthday and for fathers day. and then we go to the croson's for fathers day with them. that means lots of food! i've been chatting with jason a lot lately. he was talking the otherday about flying me out to visit him for a weekend...i'm seriously tempted to! i think it'd be a lot of fun! i always thought he was HILARIOUS to hang around. memories of him running around my apartment immitating the raptor, and doing goofy dances, and i still laugh out loud! i'll talk with ryan about it, and if the offer still stands, i'll see if he'll still have me.  i've been looking back a lot on my past few years. college was a blur of depression, chocolate, and my bedroom. i didn't really do anything but wish i was home, and when i was home i wish i got to stay there. i over-reacted to a lot of things, took a lot of it personally, and i think it was majorly due to the fact that i was VERY insecure down there. after i graduated, i thought i grew up so much. then the teaching situation happened, and i was small and defensless again. then i decided to do stuff that makes me happy and started my job at the small mortgage company in lisle. i thought i grew so much. nope, wrong again. i then went to california for 5 weeks and came back, and i thought i had changed a ton. well, i changed a lot. grew up a little more. made decisions as to what i thought was important to me. and i'm still growing up. i'm at a point where everyone is expecting me to get pregnant and be an adult. and while i want to start having kids because they're so much fun, i still don't feel like i'm mature enough to handle it... oh well. basically, i've grown up a LOT since college, and i'm not done yet.  whew, that was a long tangent. back to crocheting!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....\n\nText 2:The schedule finally arrived for the conference on Slavery, Racism, and the Christian Church, to be held at Baylor University.

As long as there is no ethical conflicts that would create a threat to independence. Although I think I'd be a better computer technician than auditor.'    Independence?  Ethical conflict?  What were you expecting, you are gonna work for Al Capone?  Hehe.  Mando is an honest man. And he's too kind.  Too kind, in fact, that if someone tells him that 'dirty money' is more practical in this time and age, he would accept investments on it!  Nah, Aside from his kindness, he carries these moral values that I really don't understand.  Actually I don't understand most moral values, especially traditional ones.    Although I am totally disturbed when people think I have no moral values, or my moral values are completely out of control.  Hell, what am I, Satan?  Spawn?  Wolverine?  I am not the fictitious anti-hero people think agnostics and athiests are.  Actually I want to be out of agnosticism and relive my Christian life.  However, when I pray more, the more I lose my faith.  And when I start to have faith in 'The Guy', there's this daemon at the back of my mind taunting the back the skepticisms I bear.

Saturday morning I looked on Ticketmaster.com and 2 more tickets had opened up for the sold-out opera 'Carmen', put on by the Florentine Opera Company at the Milwaukee Performing Arts Center (not to be confused with Art's Performing Center, a Milwaukee strip club...Pandyland Bratwurst Jamboree starting point perhaps?...).  So I met my mom in the Beer Capital of the World for a cultural experience.  To make a long story short: my little brother played a  matador  in Carmen.  Somehow, my twerpy bro knows people in high places and got cast in this professional opera.  Can you imagine our fits of laughter when he appeared on stage with a matador's cape, black wig with a pony tail in the back, matador's hat, full make-up, and  pink  tights?  I thought I was going to lose it.  The people around us did not find it nearly as funny as we did.  Seeing him up there, trying to act serious, surrounded by world renowned opera singers was pure, unadulterated, comedy.  So that was definitely the high point of my weekend.\n\nText 2:Beware Freaks Bearing Gifts  By Depressed Duf'  It never ceases to amaze me how those who trumpet patriotism with words are also those who debase it most with their actions.    In Washington, some Senior White House official has ratted out a spy.  This is counter-espionage.  This is treason.  This is the opposite of 'united we stand.'  The USA Patriotism Act is an assualt on personal freedom and the bill of rights that would make Mussolini blush.    In California, a long standing tradition of respecting the voice of the people was ended by a recall of a Governor (unpopular though he was) who had committed no crime or malfeasance of any kind.  Last night, farce concluded the tragedy; vox populi became pox populi.  May we get the elected officials we deserve.  My favorite piece though is that while states all over America are rushing to make students recite the pledge of allegiance, our transition team in Iraq is working to remove dogma and patriotism from the schools there.  Apparently, in Iraq, style over substance is disfavored, and a return to educating children means decreasing time devoted to anything except the three R's.  I like the pledge of allegiance.  I don't think anyone should be forced to say it (that pesky first amendment and all), but the pledge, in and of itself will do little to make children understand or love America.  For that, I think we should favor more substantive things.  Of course, it would mean a shift away from words and toward action."], "gold_label": 1.0}

The huge colony stretches under the southern Australian city of Melbourne. Argentine ants are not harmful to humans, but have been known to displace native plants and animals. 'In Argentina, their native homeland, ant colonies span tens of meters, are genetically diverse and highly aggressive towards one another,' Monash University researcher Elissa Suhr said in a statement this week. 'So, population numbers never explode and they are no threat to other plants and animals.' However, Suhr said the genetic structure of Argentine ants here has changed since they first arrived in 1939, making them less aggressive and more likely to mate with ants from neighboring nests. 'Now they're uncolonial ... and the ants from different nests are not aggressive towards one another. So that enables them to grow into an absolutely enormous colony that covers the whole city,' Suhr told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio late Wednesday. Suhr said the Argentine ants could even displace native species by taking over local habitats and preying on insects commonly eaten by Australian ants. Australia is not the only country to be invaded by the Argentine ants, Suhr said. 'In California, they have displaced native ants, decreased the diversity of other native insects, affected the dispersal of seeds and even decreased lizard numbers,' she said.

People say I've done a lot in my life despite my age. I was an athelete, musician, involved in student government in high school. I've volunteered at high schools, coached wrestling, and worked 4 very different jobs. I had 2 majors and a minor and I'm in a phd program right now. I've seen cities all over California, and been to Reno, Vegas, Taiwan, Mexico, and Western Europe. I've stage dove, moshed, been to operas and musicals, the great museums of the world and been to a fringe festival more or less. I've seen a punk rock midget, S&M people, prostitutes in Amsterdam, and met pro-wrestlers. I've been drunk, beaten, bloody, and burned. I've been in newspapers and I have many friends. You would think that I've lived enough to grow up. Or perhaps since I've lived an interesting life, I'm reluctant to grow up.  This growing up thing, where I should act and dress more respectably is tough. At some point in the next few years, I'll end up teaching college course and eventually be called professor... I'll have to look and act professional. I can't be as nihilist or apathetic as I am now. I shoud be worrying about getting a job when I graduate and becomeing 'successful.' Yet I'm still in a phase of my life right now where I still want to stage dive at shows, crush beer cans with my skull, and wear punk band shirts.  The fact that I was annoyed at the lack of chaos and mayhem at last night's grad student party makes me aware of unwillingness or inability to 'grow up.' I had a good time last night, but there wasn't the drunken revelry that representative of what I want in my life.

BananaFroggie:  you remind me of myself at your age TIMMAH34N: smart genious girl BananaFroggie: well for one thing, i highly doubt if true love even really exists, but if it does, it does not come after a few weeks or even months of knowing someone, it comes after you have made that long term, once in a life time commitment to them and when you learn to trust and know someone better than you do yourself.

Don't you just wish you could blindly believe in love the way he does?  I know that I wish I could.  I don't even know why I tried to destroy his dreams...I am such a horrible person.

Three juicy months of summer dead ahead, waiting to be wasted.  I'll be a senior next year, yay!  I'm completely exhausted after today;  Right after school, me and a bunch of friends headed over to Famous Dave's BBQ for lunch (which by the way, fed me some of the best wings I've ever had, I recommend that place to everyone), then dropped by our respective houses to pick up some work-out clothes, and played basketball at the Y.  I love playing there, especially when all the black dudes from last year's team from Milton are there.  Every once in a while its nice to play people as good or not quite as good as you because then, you dominate.  However, I lean towards goin against the older and more experienced players, as its the best way to improve, in my opinion.  I learned something kinda cool today.  You know the phrase 'cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey'? Well, that idiom originated in the Civil War when ships would carry iron cannonballs as ammunition, but they would always roll around the deck on the high seas.  Sailors devised a way to keep them in place by stacking them in a pyramid and putting a frame around the bottom layer, called the 'monkey'.  These frames were generally made out of brass, and unfortunately contracted in very low temperatures, making the balls roll right out, hence 'cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.'  I guess you learn somethin new everyday, huh?  Those thats have gone to school with me this year probably know that the senior trip next year is to Mexico, but I think it would be alot more fun to go somewhere else.  My vote would be Barcelona, if money permits.  We should start a movement for that...  -KC\n\nText 2:Ay sus... Anyway, may bago pong submission sa site ko.

Times.     A turning point for the nation    By Barbara Boxer    EVERYWHERE I go, I hear the same thing: 'This is the most important election of my lifetime.'   I think I know why. We are broke, and current policies are digging us deeper into debt. When President Clinton handed the Oval Office keys to President Bush, we had a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion. Now we have deficits and debt. Our-go-it-alone policy in Iraq has isolated us from our allies and placed the burdens of the war on the backs of American taxpayers and our men and women in uniform.   The rollback of more than 350 environmental policies and regulations is leading us toward dirtier air and water, more cancer, more asthma among our children, and a loss of our pristine lands. The No Child Left Behind Act is turning into a hollow, empty promise to millions of children.   Then there are the terrorist threats -- this administration holds a press conference about these threats on almost a weekly basis. But where is the plan to protect our people and to catch those who would do us harm?   Congress is ready to move on Homeland Security. There is a rail security bill that is waiting for full Senate action. There are also port, nuclear, and chemical security bills that the Senate Majority Leader can call up whenever he pleases. Surely he would focus on national security after Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned that Al Qaeda was planning another large-scale attack.   But no. Republicans and the president want to talk about an issue they consider more important than saving American lives from another terrorist attack: more important than education or deficit reduction, more important than our kids getting asthma or our sons and daughters losing their lives and limbs abroad. The issue: a constitutional amendment on marriage. Yes, this is the most important election of our lifetime.   We need to get our priorities in order. We can start by electing John Kerry president.    Barbara Boxer is a US senator from California.\n\nText 2:Our recent run of good weather had been put to an end today as it tipped down during lunch, much to my anger as we stopped playing a good ol' game of rugby. Backed onto our line I had no way of clearing the ball as Taj did not run behind me, as I was urging him to. The game was called off in the end as of excess rain, although continuing the game would of been fun.  Was woken up at 7:30 this morning to have a shower, however I didn't creep out of my bed until 7:45 (oooooooh such a rebel). A lack of Head & Shoulders shampoo meant 'argh crappy stuff' that made my hair smell badly of strawberry. I did not like this, and had to put up with the smell of strawberry running through my hair until the rain cleansed it out at lunch.  Studied the Holocaust and Nazi propaganda in history and I managed to write a heck of a lot during the lesson, no one really had anything interesting to say so I just got on with my work.  Assembly was called off because of year 7 exams I think, but nevertheless it was called off and we went to tutor where I managed to eat a subtle amount of food.  In DT I managed to actually draw the outline for our woodwork projects, and I'm pretty sure I'm feeling ok today. Break managed to pass with nothing actually happening, and as I write this I do remember me and James discussing Eurovision as I was singing a part from the Ukraine entry, le woo for cheesy music contests.  Got sent out of Citizenship for being sarcastic and chatty, and put on a 'last warning', later to be warned again for eating sandwiches in class. I like my tutor, I think he can be funny at times, but I just have this feeling hes losing his, erm, how you say it, 'cool'. Heh, now I sound like an idiot. Michael told me he had Mr Tate for Science as Mr Maher was planning to give pupils in our class detentions on Monday. Of course, as usual, I misheard this and began to make poor one-liners.   'Mr T teahces you Science?! I pity the foo' that messes with sulphuric acid!'   Michael laughed though, so I suppose we have hope here in Swindon...  In French Katie made me wear her sunglasses and as I put them on, she took a picture of me on her camera phone. I only saw the picture at the end of the lesson and looked the foo' (oh yes, Mr T styley). I couldn't stop her from showing it to other people though, so I guess people laughed at it. Hell, it made them smile, thats good right?  At lunch James was a bit angry as Mr Runham had totally ignored him for twenty minutes in his Maths lesson when he needed an explanation to a question. The end result is as follows:     Tis a mad James, but if you look a little closer, you'll notice he's very organised, hes even remembered to update his blog! He'll have to give me the link some time so I can pimp his up.  In yesterday's entry I forgot to include some photos I had taken, so I take it upon myself to add these here now.     This was taken in Drama (so maybe it was a picture from Wednesday then :P) and is a shot of Dee trying to maul her fingers to death. Having the flash off caused one hand to not be blurred and another clutching a pen to be very blurred. I kind of liked the way it turned out, so I guess thats why its here.     This is a wall. +2 points for observation. I edited the colours very quickly in Photoshop otherwise this would have been a very dull black & white photo of a wall... Erm, I guess its still a dull picture of a wall anyway, but at least its in a good colour.     I guess I'm adding this picture for the sake of it. Its not really good at all, however I do believe that the high resolution copy of this picture looks way much better.  Going back to our lunchtime shenanigans now. *End cheesy transmission music*  The weather to begin with was very nice, good warm temperature, shining very brightly. Didn't do or say much, but at least it was good weather.     There isn't much point to this picture, but you can see that it is bright in that picture, and this was taken about twenty minutes before the rain really kicked in. I was playing rugby with James, Taj, Devon (haha), Jack and Joe for a while. I had already screwed up once, but to save face, I just blame Taj for not being behind me so I could pass to him. Rain had started to spit slightly but we still went on regardless of this, and then we had to call the game off because it really did start to rain then. I did taken an enjoyment to watching people run madly across the field to get shelter.     Look raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain! *ahem*  Bell went and I went into James' music room for a little while. Just before I left I looked across the room trying to find something. I had only just realised that I had lost my boot bag. Without thinking I found myself continually saying 'Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger' right in front of Mr Sizeland. By now the class had found it hilarious, and I guess I did too, after all I was making a complete fool of myself. Mr Sizeland told me to go look for it and I quickly pounced off to my French class where I did indeed find my boot bag.  Went past James' music room again on the way to PE, knocked on the window, did a little celebratory dance whilst everyone laughed (again), and I could hear Sian shouting 'Bugger, bugger, bugger!'. The things I do to entertain people I tell thee...  High jump in PE, avoided it a bit, then got into it. In the competition I only got through to the second round, but went out of that after I think my shirt came into contact with the line. In the end Bobby won with a height of 165cm if I remember correctly.  With that done, my school day had finished and I went off home. But before I go any further, why not have a picture of some leaves?     Yes, didn't do much after school. Spoke to Rebecca and other people on MSN, watched The Lenny Heny Show and ate apple and raspberry pie.  Have to run into town tomorrow to buy myself a new book to use as journal when I am unable to get onto the internet and post something here, so maybe you'll read something more interesting in the near future. Today is firday, so the b3ta newsletter should be released. I'm off now, toodles."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Just kidding.....Anyway, today's selection for excellent children's book is  Diary of a Wombat  by Jackie French, illustrated by Bruce Whatley.  I find this book exceptional because it informs children of other animals of the world, namely Australia, and is just adorable.       Here is brief decription:  What, exactly, do wombats do all day? One enterprising wombat answers that question and a few others in diary form in French's (No Such Thing) tongue-in-cheek picture book. After explaining his unique Australian heritage, the star of this volume paints a funny, if rather dull, picture of his daily routine. 'Monday Morning: Slept./Afternoon: Slept./ Evening: Ate grass./ Scratched./ Night: Ate grass.' Things begin to perk up, however, when the wombat discovers its new human neighbors. Before long, the always-hungry creature is at their door begging for food (preferably carrots or oats), digging in their garden ('Began new hole in soft dirt') and turning his neighbors' belongings into scratching posts. Happily, the human family appears to take the antics of their adopted wild 'pet' in stride (though the wombat sees things a bit differently 'Have decided that humans are easily trained and make quite good pets').   Thank you amazon.com....the illustrations are fabulous and cute and I found myself rooting for this pesky creature and his quest for carrots, something I might not say if it was entitled 'Diary of a Possum'.  Check this out next time you are visiting Borders or Barnes and Noble.\n\nText 2:Now that my grad school applications are in (yip, yip, oooooooh yeah), I have found a new activity to fill my afternoons while Grace naps.  While snooping around the Rousseau household, I happened upon some Kathy Smith workout DVDs that Susan does (she's my boss, the family's mama-and I must say, I applaud her for staying in such great shape after popping out fo' chillins).  So I decided to venture into the world of working out, not only for my health but also for the great quotes ('and lift it, and stretch it, and pump it, and pulse it, you're doing FANTASTIC' *if I ever made a workout tape, I'd substitute snacktastic*).  At any rate, Kathy Smith is full of enthusiasm for fitness and at first, I found myself wanting to thank her for her encouraging words.  But after doing 'Timesaver: Lift Weights to Lost Weight' a few times, I find them to be ridiculous.  For all Kathy knows, I am sitting on the couch with a bag of Doritos, laughing at her antics and comments (to a big black guy who's part of her weight-lifting crew: 'How come your bicep's bigger than mine?'...'Pump it!').  So far, my efforts have left me with a sore back and shoulders but no muscles; I may have to turn to steroids for the hardcore woman weightlifter's body I've always coveted.  Bottom line, kickin' it with Kathy is an okay way to pass some time in the afternoon; now, next time I see any of you, I'll expect comments on my scuplted arms and calves.

A friend sent this forward to me yesterday.  I got a slight chuckle out of it.  All the males I passed it on to guffawed: My wife and I have the secret to making a marriage last:  Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant, have a little wine, some  good food and companionship. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays.   We also sleep in separate beds. Hers is in Sydney and mine is in Melbourne. I take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back. I asked my wife where she wanted to go for our anniversary.  'Somewhere I haven't been in a long time!' she said. So I suggested the  kitchen. We always hold hands. If I let go, she shops. She has an electric blender, electric toaster and electric bread maker.  Then she said, 'There are too many gadgets and no place to sit down!'. So I bought her an electric chair. Remember.... Marriage is the number one cause of divorce. Statistically, 100% of all divorces started with marriage. I married Miss Right. I just didn't know her first name was Always.   I haven't spoken to my wife for 18 months. I don't like to interrupt her. The last fight was my fault. My wife asked, 'What's on the TV?'.... I said, 'Dust!' In the beginning, God created earth and rested. Then God created man and rested. Then God created woman. Since then, neither God nor man has rested. Why do men die before their wives? 'Cause they want to'.\n\nText 2:Perhaps I am spreading myself too thin.&nbsp; &nbsp; I keep two journals...one under my bed that has been the undoing of many relationships, and one I carry in my bag with me everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately I have been neglecting both, which loosely means, really, that I have been neglecting myself.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; Or, still?&nbsp; I write of what I think I know, but actually it is more of what&nbsp;I do not know.&nbsp; I feel uninspired, stressed, used up.&nbsp; I said I was going to do so much and have accomplished so little in the past&nbsp;four months.&nbsp; Big plans deflate easily with muse and distraction.&nbsp; How much of that is circumstance and how much is free will? &nbsp;  There were always in me, two women at least, one woman desperate and bewildered, who felt she was drowning and another who would leap into a scene, as upon a stage, conceal her true emotions because they were weaknesses, helplessness, despair, and present to the world only a smile, an eagerness, curiosity, enthusiasm, interest. &nbsp; -Anais Nin"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Gosh, that sounds worse! Now, on to listening to my music (right now 'Waitin' On a Sunny Day' by Bruce Springsteen) But will it work? Only time will tell. As John Ondrasik said when I met him: These are the best days of my life. And its true, but I don't have enough of a life to make anything of it. When school starts, thingh will HAVE to change.. They have to! I have to make a life worth living. If not, I'm going to end up all dried up and mean. I need friends other then over the internet. I mean, my best friend is over 100 miles away, and 10 years older then me. What the hell? I am just soo disappointed in the way my life is turning out. I want a change, I want to get a phone call. I want to go out with friends.. Or **gasp** a guy! I just want something different. And I am happy, I know this, but I want to be  happy  you know? I guess not, I'm talking to a freaking computer! Wow, I am pathetic. I should get out my yearbook, and call someone... But I  HATE  calling people! I don't know why, I just don't like calling people. Another thing I want different. **sigh** I need to go out to the Mills.  I guess the only thing that will cheer my up would be talking about the love of my life: Shawn Knobelock. He is soo amazing. I can't believe that he is in Maryland with the Army. He is gone for 3 months, and I know that I will most likely never see him. But 'Even though ending are never ever happy, It's the happy moments along the way, that in the end make it ok' John Ondrasik strikes again! LoL. Gosh, It's already past 1:00am... Weird. But I feel I need to talk about Shawn to cheer me up.. But what memory.. My favorite one was at the home tournment. I was at a table, scoring, and he was next to me. He was the time keeper. He wore a skull cap... susprisingly good on him. He kept hitting me with the towel... oh God, Trapt just came on my LaunchCast radio station.. I'll get to that later.. But anyways, that night, I know he was flirting with me.. Why couldn't I act on it? We might be together now if only I had acted! I'm an idiot, I know. OK, now onto Trapt. Everytime Trapt plays, I want to cry. See, one tournment, Shawn borrowed my CD player to listen to the Self Titled Trapt CD. He had to warm up, so he gave me back my CD player and said 'You should listen to it, its an ok CD.' So I did, and I loved it. Now, everytime I hear a Trapt song, I think of Shawn.. And I want to cry soo badly! He will NEVER know how much he means to me. I can see myself growing old with him. I can see us with Kids, and everything imaginable... Is it an illusion? It can't be. I cannot believe that. I just pray that I get another one of Shawn's hugs. They are so precious now. I wish I could remember every detail of him. I know that I can't ever forget his ice blue eyes, or his smile, or his laugh, or his smell of his cologne. I could be doing anything, then, just for a split second, I'll smell his cologne, then it will be gone, and I strain to smell it again. And my heart breaks. I cannot help it. Well, It's late, I need to go.  ~~Breena"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Mini pumpkin pies, sugar drop cookies, pumpkin bread and the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted.  And they ship well, too.  Last night we decided (we being my two children) that it was time to decorate the tree.  Only problem is that we don't have a tree.  Got lost in all the moving over the past 3 years, I guess.  So, I suggested we decorate the bamboo tree on the terrace.  They loved it!  And after we were finished with the tree (we being mostly me this time), it looked pretty good.  Why shouldn't you have a bamboo tree for Christmas in Miami?  We are the epitomy of tropical chic. *grin*  And, if it had been 40 degrees colder last night, it would have snowed.

Needless to say, I was brought up in the Catholic tradition as well.  Catholic grade school, college, AND grad school - the whole nine yards.  I was a bit of a 'talker' during my grade school years (shocker) and got smacked upside the head more than a few times by some crotchety old nuns after getting caught 'talking to my neighbor' during class.

You walk into class.  You're nervous because you don't know anyone. A few minutes pass and you walk farther into the room, clutching your mom or dads hand with all your might, after taking off your coat. All the other kids are laughing and playing, you're an outsider. Your parents send you off to play with the other kids while they talk to your teacher. You nervously aproach sum of the other kids, who are playing with a farm puzzle.*RUSTY!!!!* They ask if you want to play with them, you shyly nod your head. Everything's ok...  There's the killer.

Friends that you've promised to be frfiends forever with, even to college and past marriage. Marriage. Who would think of marriage?!?!?!  Girls have cooties and boys are stupid. You go outside for recess and laugh and play with your friends. After recess you come inside and have milk and cookies. You feel a little tired so you put your head down and you take a quick snooze. Life is good...  Doesn't that sound nice?  You're awoken by a slap to the face. You fell asleep in American Lit. again.

Yippee, didn't do too badly for my essays, better than I expected, considering all the last minute work I did hehe. Praise God it all turned out fine...  Yesterday night was a movie marathon as I spent a couple hours under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, watching Y Tu Mama Tambien as part of the Moonlight Cinema festival. The festival runs for about 3 1/2 months till mid March, with screenings of shows like Grease, or Frida or My Big Fat Greek Wedding - basically an eclectic mix of shows, and even Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as the festival closer.  Following the nice picnic under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, EG and I joined Charles, Alan and Shawn watching double-o-seven on the big screen at 12.45 am - explosions and diamonds for everybody! I have to admit though, the film's storyline was slightly more interesting than the bland catch-me-if-you-can scenario played out in the last, what, 19 or 20 Bond flicks? This time, he's Renegade!

Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their 'living rooms.'  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  'Oh, my gosh!' says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. 'I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!'  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to 'go no-kill.' The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  'What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly,' says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. 'This place is bright and friendly.'  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored 'dog living rooms.' About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, 'I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach.'   'They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside,' says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A 'lifelong dog person,' Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. 'It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog.' A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 'kennel runs,' each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat 'condos' and three cat 'cotillions' -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  'When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level,' says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. 'If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them,' says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. 'Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring,' the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. 'It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs,' says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 'companion animals' end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? 'It just blew my mind,' she says. 'Six cats and two dogs.'  On the second floor is a 'humane library,' a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  'Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it,' says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an 'international chat' online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. 'We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity,' says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as 'The Ultimate Pet Care Facility,' it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  'It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change,' says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  'You work really hard,' says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people 'care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes.'  What worked in Richmond, she explains, 'was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked.'  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  'I have trouble with that comparison,' she says. 'If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  'All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives.'\n\nText 2:Bless your heart, Mir...first Clark, now Edwards...not very clear on the concept of electability, are you?  ;-)"], "gold_label": 1.0}

She had a broken leg and they would have put her down if we hadn't claimed her.  So she was just a baby (4 mos) and so we had the surgery done and all.  Anyway, at the time we had cats, but they've been gone now for a couple of years and she is very firmly established as The Dog of the House.  She loves people.  All people, any people.  People who want to break in, I'm sure, she would welcome with open paws.  But she hates animals.  And insects.  Birds.  Frogs.  Anything non-human that moves.  Very territorial, she is.  Anyway, the people nextdoor have this black cat, probably not even six months old now, that got in our backyard and was sitting outside our back door.  The dog went nuts, and so after a minute of trying to shoo the cat away, we figured, okay, let's let her have at it.  Well, she went nuts chasin the cat across the yard.  The cat thought it could get out through the fence (major misjudgement) but couldn't, so they went around and around for about 15 seconds and then the cat took off and got over the fence before my lil watchdog could get to her.  Was this mean?  You shoulda seen her with every bit of fur on her whole body all sticking straight up like she was somebody.  And that kink in her tail was so tight it had to hurt.  She was like, Look at me! Look at me! Look what I did!  Normally she does 'perimeter patrols' around the fence every time she's outside.  Now she's got her nose stuffed up against the door trying to get a whiff of that cat.  I got a feeling she's just dying for that cat to try coming in our yard again.    Don't worry, I wouldn't have let her kill the cat or anything.  Bree's got a bad leg.  She's not all that fast, and the backyard is uneven, so she hops-the one leg is 2' shorter than the others.

Since this past week, I've been trying to change a lot of bad habits that have sucked my life away.  This time around, I'm really trying to do it based on the firm faith of Christ's sovereignty over existence, not just wishful thinking.  I am starting to see that it will be an extended and consistent process of reminding myself again and again about what's real and to act accordingly.  To explain, it's reminding myself that though my emotions and whims are strong, Christ's command of reality is ultimately stronger; therefore, if I ask Him to help me, He will.  And, He has.  I know that I won't do well on this test tomorrow, but that doesn't matter.  The fact that I was able to study this past weekend is testament to Christ's strength.  Every fiber in my being didn't want to study, and usually I would have listened to my body's objection, but I asked Christ to exert His control and give me the strength and motivation to do it.  Yeah, so, I studied, and to the best of my ability.  Yeah, I won't do well, I don't have nearly good enough of a command of everything, but that's ok.

I spent a lot of the plane ride here working on the lyrics for a song now entitled THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. Meanwhile, I have music to work on, but there has been so much material recorded recently that it's jamming up my sweet laptop. Speaking of which, I've worn the battery down to the bone so I stopped by Apple to grab me a new one and doubled the RAM in this bitch so it moves a bit faster. Feels good.  Spent a lot of time here with my friend the Famous Comic Book Writer who just gets better and better and is doing amazing job writing my all time favorite title TEEN TITANS. He is so good and such a sweet guy. We spend every Wed I'm in LA buying comics and hopefully we will be collaborating on something big in the future. He also has a cool wife and a very cool office which he shares with another cool comic writer you all read.   Meanwhile...for Mark Mohtashemi and a few others who asked, here are your answers on THIS:  'Greetings, wireheads:   Jared here. This is just a quick posting to explain why the CHEMLAB record\u2019s taking so damned long to hit the streets. Jason and Jamie and FJ and I (along with a few other key noisists) had a fantastic, spring-wound, deepcut-groove time writing and tearing apart the trax that make up OXIDIZER. It\u2019s a great record, very much in the vein of BURN OUT, while not imitating it. It updates and mutates and at its heart is a detonator coil set to go.   I\u2019m really proud of it and everything that\u2019s brought it this far. I want to make sure that all of Jason, Jamie and FJ\u2019s hard work gets shown off in the best possible way, with the most power. However, everyone on the project felt that it got rushed at the end and needed more than we could give it at the time. It was a tough call but we\u2019ve decided to bring in a second producer, Julian Beeston, to work with us on finishing off the record. This means that the record won\u2019t be coming out until January but when it hits the streets, it\u2019s guaranteed to be a multi-layered sonic beast even more improved by a second drag through the mixing desk.  To compensate somewhat for this disappointing delay, I\u2019ll have copies of a limited edition EP with me on the Pigface tour. It\u2019ll have a few trax on it that you might be interested in - a couple of trax from OXIDIZER, as well as two from some EAST SIDE MILITIA demos which I came across recently. The demos feature Geno and the late great William Tucker - very different versions than on the album, and they sound amazing!  Also, the official CHEMLAB web site will be up and running by the time I start the Pigface tour on November 5th. Be warned, it\u2019s going to be in a state of mutation and freak-out for quite a while, shifting a lot as new discolorations are revealed. Check it out at www.hydrogenbar.com   OXIDIZER couldn't have happened without Jason, Jamie and FJ, and come January, I hope you\u2019ll all agree that it was well worth waiting for. In the meantime, thanks for your patience.  Now hold still: here it comes...  jared'  A lof this was news to me, though now I'm hoping the remix in progress (now in the hands of Ash) makes it to the new EP. Timing is an issue and we will bust ass to try and get it on there in time. For the record, we (as the aggression, remember them?) are remixing the track BINARY NATION, one I co-wrote and play on, and is quite in the vein of BURN OUT AT THE HYDROGEN BAR. You'll dig it. Here is my comment on the EP from the Cracknation website 'The EP should be interesting. There's a ton of stuff from JCPS that they never used that I compiled for Jared some months ago off a beaten up old cassette that will be on this thing. I'm curious as to what he will pick as there is some crazy shit (and honestly, there is some stuff that would have REALLY made that album a lot better, including alternate takes and such, as well as tunes they never finished)'  Anyway, everything is cool and I am driving a convertable here in LA, which is another story in itself. Forgive me, but it's time to eat at C'Brea, my favorite place to eat in LA.  F  PS: Stu Hart, legendary patriarch of the famous wrestling family, passed away today. Owen, I'm sure is waiting in that ring in the sky waiting to thrown down with his pop again.

I want to write this down, to see if I can find an interpertation of it later:  Starts out that my whole family goes there, by that , I basically mean my sisters, A., her fiance, and baby Jaz, and S., my other sister. So we fly to Europe( I suppose so that part wasn't in the dream).  We are at C.'s flat, which in the dream is more like a huge loft. And  I hardly see C. while we are there. We basically make ourselves at home, and show ourselves around. We talk briefly with C.'s sister, and neice.   Then the wedding day comes. We are in our dresses, running around like chickens with our head cut off, and I haven't any nice shoes.. I look around and around.. and shop (at a store convienantly located in the house, and find nothing.. so I basically end up wearing some old shoes I had that were like slippers and white. And then, we have no flowers or decorations, so we use some flowers that C. has in his house, and the same for decorations.    We get married, and it looks like a zoo, no organization at all, but we look happy. Then afterwards, C is on a bicycle and wanting to ride down the hill, and I hop on the bicycle with him, and we race down the hill. ( I am thinking .. WTF.. and laughing at the same time)   Also some things that happen in the dream, is that D. gets sick, and some guy I know, supposedly in the dream, a Doctor, comes to fix her up. I get this bad feeling and stop him. In the meantime someone has called the cops. We find out he was trying to poison her.  It was very scary.  Then, part of the dream we find out C. had a twin brother.. (who looks nothing like him) this guy is raggedy and apparently he is always in the basement, working.  I figured he's either a strange artist or a slave in the dream.   Then, something I forgot, before C. and I ride off on the bicycle, we talk to his uncle. His uncle wants to buy this book, apparently an antique, and C. says he can have it for 15 dollars..  Uncle opens the book and laughs, saying it is worth much more. C. just shruggs, uncle hands him some money, and C. hands it to me.  I start counting the money, it is much more than 15 dollars.   That is all I can remember of the dream right now, but maybe later some more will come to me. I got to get going, got a long day ahead of me. I am going to school with D. to help with the kids on the bus."], "gold_label": 0.0}

What the heck!  I also realised that I get grumpy when the bus takes six hours to drive somewhere that anyone else could drive in a little over three hours.  Buses suck, I might start taking the train.  Also, this is a thing of beauty:    Let us all meditate on the scenic sauciness of the young Johnny Depp.  And then let's complain to random people for the rest of the day, 'But why is the RUM gone??' in honour of his piratey goodness.  News items: 1. I let my sister, Melissa, cut my hair.  I am a brave woman.  And, startlingly saucy with short hair.  Yay! 2. I have a date on Friday.  Or Saturday.  This weekend sometime.  We'll see. 3. It is my birthday on March 4th.  Soon I will be 23, and I can't decide if that is incredibly old or incredibly young.  Most of the people I go to school with are around 18, so I feel old, and most of my friends/roommates are in their late 20s, so I feel young.  Meh. 4. BOTH of my sisters have boyfriends.  Don't ever let someone tell you that life is fair. 5. My dad's birthday was this past Saturday (the 21st), he is now 54.  You should  urlLink email him  and congratulate him. 6. I have a new roommate, Karen.  The jury is still out on her, but she's an excellent photographer, cheerful (if loud), and likes to play Scrabble.  These are all good things. 7. I don't sleep well when I'm at my parents' house.  Maybe the bed sucks?  Maybe I am not used to the house anymore?  Maybe sleeping with someone else (sister) is weird? 8. I read Charles Templeton's book  urlLink Farewell to God  in 2 days.  Not the arguments I would have chosen, but an interesting read nonetheless.  (Templeton was Billy Graham's partner [in ministry, sickos] when he started out and decided that Christianity was wrong after about 10 years of preaching.

Well, my blog address is trebloc.blogspot.com.  I know what you are thinking, 't-r-e-b-l-o-c??? WTF?!?!?!'  Here is the story behind this seemingly odd name:  As most kids around the age of 6 or 7, you and your best friend spend a lot of time together.  My best friend Ryan and I first met in first grade during 'movie' time.  Our classrooms were connected by a door, and the 2 classes frequently did activities together such as recess, movie time, we were all one team for field day, etc.  We also lived in the same neighborhood (I first made my Christopher Columbus-like discovery on one of my many bike rides around my neighborhood--I was a workout freak even then..LOL).  So, since first grade, we were inseparable.  We spent the night together at each others houses every weekend.  We carpooled together to and from school.  We played together after school.  His mom was my second mom and mine his.  His dad was a father figure to me.  He 'inherited' a sister from me and I 'inherited' a brother from him.  We went on vacations together.  Bottom line:  we were ALWAYS together!  Spending so much time together, we thought that we would be the clever little rascals that my mom said we were and devise our own language.  We would talk in this language when others were around just to baffle them.  Our secret language...(gasp)...was to say words backwards!  Ok, ok...I know you are laughing at this point saying that this is just 'Pig Latin' and that a lot of kids do this.  We didn't have a clue at the time that our seemingly ingenious language was anything less than original.  We thought we were soooo cool.  Who knew?    Anyway, T-R-E-B-L-O-C is just my last name backwards--COLBERT.  Clever, eh?

Anyways saw my tutor just before her next class and got back my radio assignment, which i did pretty ok in.  My good buddy Charles got his back too - and i'm pretty upset on his behalf. I read his piece a little before he handed it in, and i really don't think it deserved a P. At the very very least an H3 (the grading system in Melbourne Uni is H1, then H2A, H2B, H3, Pass, Fail). And according to him she sorta 'dissed' his idea for the feature story too.  He wanted to write on Palms - or rather Personal Digital Assistants. Can you believe that she hasn't heard of them? Then again, I'm not surprised...apparently Australia is about 5 years behind in the whole PDA world - like their AUSPUG (Australian Palm Users Group) was just set up recently (as compared to the thriving one in S'pore and the States which have been around for ages).

Like natural healing and all. But i think the story's been done before, so I'm trying to take a fresh approach. I thought of pursuing the angle of people studying naturopathy and why they choose to do so etc., but i realise that it's too narrow for a 2500-wd piece. The most i can squeeze outta this angle is about 1500 wds? And that's the max. So what to do then? (Any ideas, please let me know). I'll prob. see her again on Monday to discuss.  All ritey then.

Today was out last day of camp and im not to stoked about the way i threw. Monday i did ok which was rather shocking cuz my&nbsp;shoulder&nbsp;didn't hurt. Tuesday i did really well and wednesday i sucked. He wanted to see my drop alot and it just wasn't workin out. So yeah. And then today my shoulder was killing me so i sucked even worse. Anyways this morning the doctor dude called mom and told her that its seperated and he wants to do surgery after the season. The deal is he said it takes 6 to 8 months to heal&nbsp;completely and i only have 4 after highschool ball before for the maverics start up agian. and theres no way i can even go for months with out pitching cuz i'll be screwed. Anyways my dads taking me down to arizona to visit the campus next week and im stoked. I've wanted to play for the wildcats for like..ever. lol.     &nbsp;   Jesse just went back to doing the same things he did before. Pete came over and gave me like the worst most romantic moment of my life. So i'm spending the week at Harlies apartment ~>all by myself :^)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Anyways someone tells jesse that they saw pete's car and that me and him were there alone. not even anything about he was naked lol. And jesse calls me on my cellphone&nbsp; while im in the middle of watching sex and the city so of course i was a little pissed. And he is all chewing me out for having pete there and being 'bitchy' about him finding out. And im all flustered cuz i'm missin my damn show for this so im just like look jess i'll call you back later and being the asshole he is he is like 'holy jesus he's still there isn't he?' so i just hung up and left the phone off the hook. damn. So i called him at nine and told him what went down and how i 'upset' i was that he thought i could do anything to him. (like him thinking i cheated on him would be any big shocker.) So i told him i couldn't take it anymore and broke up with him. And thats where we are now. bye :^)    P.S.

Mostly because of games and movies: Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 Warcraft 3 Neverwinter Nights Sid Meier's Sim Golf and I'm watching all sorts of movies that my roommate Dan owns.  Tonight I watched... Undercover Brother, Pitch Black, and Life as a House. It's because of 'Life' that I think I'm writing here, now.  My roommate presented me with a term about someone they knew. They called them 'Asexual' which I realized is how some of my friends and I live our lives. I have this huge fear of rejection ingrained in my being. I think it's made me rather prude when I think that there's lots of girls who wouldn't have rejected a kiss by yours truly.  I'm 25 now. Still a virgin, although I think my mom doubts it.

They all turned to her with looks that said, 'That's the smartest thing we've heard you say so far, but we have no idea.  This is just how The Creators want this story to go.'  'Okay, I get the point, you guys are as clueless as I am,' Baka pointed out.  'I don't think we're as stupid as you,' Kuwabara commented.  'Oi, Numbskull, who's the one who got a  seven  one a  multiple choice test ?' Baka snapped back.  'Geh!  How do you know about that!?' he shouted at the bitailed demon.  'I'll never tell,' she responded in a eerie sing-song voice as she shook her finger slowly like a metronome in front of Kuwabara's square face.  Baka walked on ahead of him.  Kuwabara stuffed his hands in his pockets and with a slouch of his shoulders he mumbled, 'Creepy little prick.'  'I heard that.'  Suddenly a woman with light blue hair and a pink kimono flying on an oar landed in front of the group.  'Yusuke,' she said in an annoying British accent.  'Oh, who are you?'  'I'm Baka.'  'I'm Hito.'  'And we're demons who are presently helping these idiots out,' Baka said.  'Speak for yourself,' Kuwabara commented under his breath.  'I heard that.'  'Gyy!'  'Alright.  Well, anyway, Yusuke, an extremely powerful demon is heading towards Mushiori City.  He's going to kill everyone and devour them.'  'Let me guess, Botan, Koenma wants me to kill him off, right?'  'Bingo!' Botan responded cheerily.  ***  They came to a point directly in the demon's path, weapons ready.  Every foot step the demon took, he shook the ground.  The demon was huge, but even that would be an understatement.  They had to tilt their heads all the way back to see the guys face.  All of them attacked at once.  Kurama wielding his signature Rose Whip, Hiei with his katana, Kuwabara with the spirit sword (*cough* lightsaber rip off *cough*), while Yusuke, Baka, and Hito used their projectile attacks.  None of them worked, he swatted them away with a simple motion of his hand.  'You can't defeat me with those pathetic attacks, you fools.'  'Gah!  Bad breath!' Baka stated as she covered her sensitive nose.  With his abnormally large hand, the demon swept them all away, sending them into trees.  'Damn!' Hiei spat as he picked himself off the ground.  'Such insanely strong power!  How will we defeat him?' Kuwabara paniced.  'Drama prince.  This calls for my infamous tear-jerking jaw-breaker.'  Baka pulled a fist-sized red orb out of thin air.  'What the hell is that?' Hiei asked.  'I just told you.  This is guaranteed to cause instant paralysis to whoever eats it.'  She walked up to the large demon, only about the height of the demon's big toe.  'Hey, mister big, powerful demon dude.  Um, I've got something you might want to try,' she shouted up to him.  The demon looked down.  'What is it?'  'Just a really tastey piece of human food.'  'Fine.'   What an idiot.   Baka climbed nimbly up a tree till she was eyelevel with the demon.  She handed him the small orb and he popped it in his mouth.  Almost instantly he froze up.  'Now!' she shouted.  Hiei took this opportunity.  He sliced through the demon like he was soft butter.  The demon disappeared instantly.  After Hiei and Baka had reached the ground, Yusuke asked, 'What did you put in those?!'  'Special secret recipe.'"], "gold_label": 0.0}

The woman kept whispering, 'Watch out for the train!' to her son, who responded with excited glances down the track.  A man sitting on the other side of the bench asked if it was the first time for the child to ride a train.  'Oh, actually, he just wanted to see the trains go by,' she replied sheepily.  'Oh,' smiled the man.  I smiled too, and noticed a tiny Tupperware container of Cheerios in her right hand.  She opened it up and offered some to her son, who accepted it gratefully.  After a ten minute wait, the moment arrived.  The man noticed the high-speed Amtrak first, and motioned for the mother to get her son's attention.  Sure enough, after a couple of seconds the bright lights in the distance were upon us, and the train sped by with a big gust of air.  As its wheels screamed over the tracks, I looked over with concern at the boy.  Would he be scared?

There are 4 oils with a distinct purpose: to energize (green), relax (lavender), romance (red),  be happy (pink). You twist the capsule open, and dab the oil onto your pulse points -- temples, wrist, sides of the throat. I had a headache last Saturday (because I played H's Gameboy Advance in the car -- bad girl!), and so I thought it would be perfect to try this new Pond's beauty item out.   I tried the lavender one. Mmmmmm. I love that scent. There was a lot of oil in that tiny capsule. The scent isn't overpowering, but it is enough to give you a momentary sense of relaxation. I dabbed the excess oil onto my hanky and just inhaled it every once in awhile. Did it relax me? A bit. It helped. But what really relaxed me was the shuteye I got afterwards. :)   Trivia: Did you know that there are  16  pulse points in our bodies? There are points on the ankles, behind the knees, on either side of the pubic bone, inside the elbows, either side of the throat, at the wrist and the temples, as well as one point at the breastbone, and another point between both of the breasts.

I think i was trying to catch up on lost disney channel time. however, much to my chagrin, by the time disney rolled around full time, mmc and kids inc were no longer in the mix. i think that scenario is also a good metaphor for my life in its entirety thus far. anyhoo. i forced myself to watch the disney channel despite the fact that pretty much all they showed was boy meets world and smart guy reruns, two shows which i thouroughly detest. but ho, there is a light at the end of this mouse-eared tunnel. that light is disney original movies. it all started one dark and stormy night. i was sick with a cold, and parked in front of the television one friday evening. my parents were out for the night because their social life is much more full and exciting than my own, and my brother was visiting. i, of course, had the disney channel in my regular channel flipping rotation and noticed that there was some sort of movie on. that movie, was entitled 'genius'. ever see it? well, i sure hadnt. i found myself completely enraptured in the film and disappointed to no end when a commercial would sneak up on me and interrupt my viewing. this particular film, if you could call it that, was about a young buck who was, well, a genius. this genius, who was about 14 or 15 and should have been in eighth or ninth grade, was actually attending college. not only was he attending college, as part of his scholarship this young lad not only had to attend classes, he also taught a class and had to put in time as an assistant to a mad-scientist type who worked in the basement of the school on a project involving molecular fusion or something equally ridiculuous. sounds plausable so far, right? well, as would any boy in his position, he realizes that even though he has all these great things that most people can only dream of, what he truly wants is to be liked. aw. so then on top of all his other commitments, he enrolls himself in the local junior high, but dresses up as a 'cool kid' complete with shades and rollerblades. he of course becomes the hottest thing since gameboy color in the eyes of his peers, and especially the girl of his dreams, who's father coincidentally enough, coaches his college's hockey team. cut to the end of the film, the hockey team is in trouble and our little genius rigs up some sort of virtual-reality/anti-gravity device that he puts on the players' skates. not making sense? well, it doesnt i assure you. of course the team wins the championship and the genius gets the girl and the respect of his fellow students alike.   reminds me of junior high, how about you? if it sounds completely ridiculous, it should. if it sounds completely implausable, it should. if you think its completely not worth your time, youre wrong. speaking from the point of view of a girl who is terribly well versed in the way of pop culture and has seen dozens upon dozens of award winning and critically aclaimed films, disney original movies are the cream of the crop. and if genius sounds good, just think about this...its probably one of my least favorite disney originals. have i peaked your interest? are you on the edge of your seat? do you want to know more?  yeah, i didnt think so. im sorry. this is why i dont update. i apologize from the bottom of my broken heart.\n\nText 2:It's common for me to be in my room, door shut, and Kara to be in her room, door shut.

Since we live in a society where the basic human needs of food, shelter, water, and sanitation are easily met, we're left with another need: what do we want?  I think when we leave 'What do I want?' unanswered, we become dysfunctional.  It also seems that if we try to answer 'What do I want?' with superficial things, we become dysfunctional.  There are so many levels of this question, and how we answer it:  'I want to be functional', 'I want to be happy,' 'I want to feel right with the world.'  When we try to answer 'What do I want?', the answers to this question become our expectations, no matter how realistic or not they are.  These expectations become so important, that our lives become dictated by the desire to meet these different expections.  The questions I have:  why are we driven by this question?

I've had a shorter temper, I've had less control over what I say and do and feel, and I've been feeling lost to this degree that I haven't felt since those tumultuous adolescent years.  I wish I didn't become such a burnout this year, but I did.  I see so many of my peers that have been able to stick it through, but as for me, I was left behind in the dust.  God seems to have engineered this year to humiliate me.  He's shown me that I am very egotistical, unfocused, uncontrolled, impatient, and weak-willed.  On the flipside, He has constantly reminded me that I'm not alone, that people love me, and that He loves me.  He has constantly bombared me with the message of the Gospel, yet, it all still hasn't been enough to turn me around from the emptiness.  Why can't my heart deeply connect with these things?  Because only the Holy Spirit can do so.  Why has the Holy Spirit refrained from doing so?

Did you know that librarians outside of North America engaged in library instruction activities?  Of course you did.  Or you at least suspected as much.  Today's blogged link is a literature review of English language sources detailing library instruction programs around the world in the last century.  Abstract:  'Librarians are teaching in classrooms all over the world. A search of library literature reveals articles on academic library instruction programs in Asia, Oceania, South America, Africa, and Europe. This page will examine the 20th Century literature that explores academic library instruction programs around the world with the exception of those in North America. Only those articles that are written in English  from 1901-2000  indexed in ERIC or Library Literature are considered. As such, many relevant articles written in other languages have probably been excluded. This also may explain why some countries that use English as a primary language (Nigeria, New Zealand) are well represented while other non-English speaking countries (France) and regions (South America) are sparsely covered in this literature review.'  Full article at:   urlLink http://www.libraryinstruction.com/liinternational.html .\n\nText 2:urlLink Library Latchkey Children. ERIC Digest.  Last summer, my academic library had problems with a bunch of trouble making juveniles from the community.  We learned that they had been banned from the public library.  Further, we learned that their parents were dropping them off at our library and using us as a babysitting service!  We clearly were not equipped to do this.   The blogged article of the day has tips for public libraries to deal with the latchkey children issue.  From the article:  Based on the author's research, the following recommendations are offered for public librarians who wish to provide more effective service to latchkey children:   1. Interact with representatives from community agencies to develop alternatives concerning latchkey children.   2. Learn about latchkey children in library school and by attending in-service training.   3. Develop and publicize positively worded written policies and procedures for dealing with latchkey children.   4. Conduct research about library latchkey children in public library settings. For example, interview latchkey children to learn which activities they prefer libraries to provide for them. Then implement and evaluate those recommendations.   5. Consider library latchkey children as providing an opportunity to work cooperatively with the community, to turn a captive audience into program potential, and to recruit future library users who enjoy books.   6. Create a separate area where children involved in after-school activities will not disturb other patrons.   7. Use the mission statement as a guide to determining the library's appropriate role in serving latchkey children.   8. Use volunteers, and designate, if possible, a librarian to be solely responsible for after-school programs.   9. Provide arts and crafts supplies, learning games, and a wide selection of books for children to use independently.

I really dunno. I had no one to talk to, no one at all. They ran away, all, before I could even approach them. Now, I'm standing, alone. They don't understand it, and they never will. I don't know why, thinking all these doesn't matter at school, the emotions will all explode the moment I reach home.I dunno why. But recently, so many things happened. So unfair. Tears had dropped countless of times, yet the matters don't help at all.. they don't. A lot of unsolvable problems. A lot of troubles. How can crying help? I dunno.............I dunno. Matters don't help, they're giving more and more serious problems then ever. Just by changing a new bag, just by sharing the same colour, people talk. I know she don't like this but this is the bag I want. I would prefer it in brown but there ain't a choice. I need the bag..........but no. People giving me all sorts of attitudes and criticises. Life's not fair at all.......................... Early in the morning, I'm fully awake today, having slept through most of the time.english lesson is quite ok..............I scored pretty ok for the common test, quite satisfied. But PE came, my imagination run wild again....I automatically volunteered to run with yuhui but she directly, out of so many people, refused, once again and again. I dunno why but I really kan ta bu shuang nowadays....... she think she who sia.............. she had so many people, loved, in co, studies oso good............I regret. I really regretted letting her to read my blog. That had not lead to good terms, that had led me to think that she will only create more and more trouble for me. Because of one yuhui, I had to do it! It ain't fair! IT IS NOT FAIR!!! The teacher skipped the geography lesson. new eh? go to recess, eat, come up. On the way I encounter yina, I told her to come for band but she skipped in the end. Why. Why is everything only happening to the thirds? Why am the one doing all these stuff!? They're fortunate to be in band...they're so many things to learn, to be together as one united band, always. But.............but............but, why are people quitting band instead...I had no choice, I had to let her go once again. I know all her friends are getting the bad impressions of me because I went to find her every single time. But no matter how much I ask, she won't come back..............she's lost. There's maths and then science. Then is band........There's not much to talk about. The silence between me and those two. I didn't want to talk at all...I know I'm the outcast. I know. I know..........but then again.....please. please do not let me feel badder by whispering between yourselves, giggling silently without telling me a single thing of what you're talking about....it's not fair at all.....is it? Why. Why am I the one suffering? Why am I the one borned with the fate of getting no trustworthy friends at all....Who. who can tell me why.................. Tell me why. Firstly, when I reached the band room. I stopped being with them. I had enough, they won't notice my prescence anyway, my existance don't make a different to this world. Why am I even borned? I don't know...I don't know...so set up instrument, go wash reed, kaingee come back to band... we didn't speak for ages but exchange just side comments. Mr ong said he don't talk except to give the place for playing and directions. It was like doing a mime....lol! Had a great time laughing.........it was great. Nizam was lame....haha. Now I see what jaslyn meant by him being a lame guy.............haha. it was a great practice, though I longed that it can be longer. But something I absolutely hate is that mr ong actually suggested us to have band remedials! FOR 2HRS  EVERYDAY !!!! OMG. from today onwards, I must work hard!! VERY HARD!haiz... Didn't fall in. This is the best time! Then borrow instrument. I saw the two of them ran away before I could even call them and reluctantly follow daphne instead. Though I didn't spend a lot of time with her, she's quite a nice girl to be with. Then her car come, we said goodbye and I saw the pair come out of sch.  i didn't know why but I immediately turn and walked away. I don't want to disturb them anymore. Their mere prescence had caused something more.......it made me feel so out of place, so odd one out, so outcast, so alone................

Its shell has been painted bright orange with a little happy mexican guy in the middle, so i call it el Matador, aka the bullfighter. el Matador lives in a small glass tank with sand and small blue rocks on the bottom. everyday, i dunk el Matador in a cup of water for his bath and pick out his tiny green poop from his tank. crabs are cool like that. their poop comes out the same color as their food, no matter what you feed it. i'd choose a crab for a pet any day; they're low-maintenance, odorless, and eat veggies, nuts, tree bark, even eggshells...now how economical is that. the only thing i have to buy is a new shell every year cuz they grow outta their old ones. What's really genius about it is that I gave one to my friend too for her birthday. not only does she have to take care of it wherever she goes out of pure obligation, i have her birthday presents covered for the next 10-15 years: funky crab shells. yep, and she was worried she'd be getting christina aguilera cd's. hehehe...  Business: it's been a crazy week at work, and i love it. i like feeling like i'm part of something important, contributing to the greater scheme of things and such. sometimes, i almost wish that i'd gotten this job a little later on in life so i'd truly appreciate it. it's got the structure/bureaucracy/politics of a large organization but the personal feel of a small office. i get to meet tons of ppl of all industries. we help ppl to get their businesses off the ground on the international front. it's just too bad i haven't made my million yet before this job. in class the other night, we were talking about negotiating raises and this lady asked me how much i was getting paid. i told her and she screamed 'WHY ARE YOU WORKING THERE??!' i dunno. my business card looks real cool though.  Sports: i read somewhere that working out can actually become an addiction. based on personal experience, i didn't believe it until i watched a documentary on female body builders. 'twas no pretty sight. i actually felt physically nauseous. so i examined my own workout routine, and despite the fact that i get a little stressed when i can't fit some physical activity into the day, i'm nowhere near those he-women. i should learn by now to not overshoot. this week, i've been setting my three alarms for 5:55/6/6:05am so that i can go jogging in the park, shower, eat breakfast, read the newspaper, and commute to work. instead, i waste thirty minutes grappling with three kinds of snooze buttons in a state of semi-consciousness. i think i've actually been getting out of bed later than before just cuz i feel so burgled of precious sleep time.  Calendar: mmmm...me like garlic hummus. i watched a beeeauyooootiful movie tonight, Chicago, for the second time. i wanna watch it over every time i hear the commercial on the radio with renee zellweger singing the beginning to Nowadays...'grand, isn't it...great, isn't it...swell, isn't it....you can like the life you're livin', you can live the life you like...and that's good, isn't it? grand, isn't it?swell...' da da daaaaaaa. man, that movie makes me wanna sing and dance. so i've been working on 'fast food nation' and 'bias,' two pretty good reads so far. the only problem is, now i feel like i have to shun the entire fast food industry, and i will never be able to look at dan peter or tom as the familiarly benign news broadcasters again. sometimes, ignorance is kinda liberating.  California: so now i really do believe that the 5 is ALWAYS congested. even an hour ago traffic was at a crawl. and that was almost 11 pm! way past my bedtime, due to a little incident with my car alarm in which i couldn't get the doors to unlock, called AAA, as soon as they pulled into the parking lot, guess what, the doors unlocked. in my embarassed flustered state, i didn't even think of tipping them for making the drive out. now i'm blacklisted with AAA. and all i could think about on my way back was writing about the whole thing on my blogger so i won't forget next time.  Health: hurray, my warts are disappearing! I think the free Warts-No-More samples i got from the last trade show really work. who said my job doesn't come with perks.  Ads: Payless is great. i bought four pairs of shoes, and it cost less than forty bucks. ever since star jones from the view became spokesperson, i no longer feel ashamed to be seen in there. no joke. none of my old shoes fit anymore. i don't know how to explain it, but i think my feet shrunk. in high school, i used to be a 7 1/2. now, i'm a size 6. what's happening?? a chilly reminder of stephen king's Thinner. i think the freaky indian guy in that movie with the big ugly mole actually plays the windex-obsessed father in my big fat greek wedding. anyway, so i was picking out my shoes, and there was this chinese lady also in her 20s who kept going for the same styles. luckily, there was always more than one pair to go around. didn't i say payless is great? so finally, she came up to me and told me what she thought i looked good in. it was true shopping camaraderie. i was so touched i wanted to ask for her number before leaving so maybe we could do this again, but was afraid she'd think i'm gay or something. nevertheless, payless is great.  Opinion: i met someone the other day who i coulda sworn was korean. in fact, i had him pegged as one of those cigarette smokin korean squatters. i was bowled over when i found out he was chinese. so the obvious follow up question i asked was, what kind of chinese are you: cantonese, taiwanese, or mainland? he looked me straight in the eye and said, 'i'm CHInese.' dang. i felt moted. one of these days, i'm gonna get in big trouble for the politically incorrect things that fall outta my mouth. the other day, i met a 'white' director. he looked white to me anyway, with a really thick accent. so i asked him if he's italian, and he said no, i'm pakistani. first thought that came to my head was: omg, i'm so sorry. thank goodness i kept my mouth shut this time. when i was younger, i'd been the target of some racist jokes. now that i'm older, i've turned into the racist. i wonder how interracial relationships work. i mean, problems arise even from being with someone of the same nationality, same age, same educational/financial/familial background. different cultural values?? how does that work when you're trying to build a family together? but then again, problems DO arise even if we're the same color, so...maybe race is not the issue...i dunno. but, the chinese guy was right, why did i have to make that subtle distinction? i mean, we're all chinese. to be more general, we're all asian, we're all ppl. and i guess applying that to a general effort to be less parochial, i should stop thinking of every white guy who shows interest in an asian girl as a perv with an asian fetish. That is, only if they stop using the word 'oriental,' cuz that just makes me feel like a piece of yellow rug.\n\nText 2:hello. i'm back. i'm tired. i'll write more later, supplemented w/ pix too. i'm pretty sure i know which school i want to go to now after my trip. in a nutshell, here are my thoughts on the schools i visited these past few days:  northwestern: perfect location. a five minute walk from chicago's magnificent mile with a lakeside view. what more could a girl ask for? oddly enough, it just didn't feel right to me. the proverbial 'click' didn't happen. it's the kind of school that, and bear in mind this is just my personal opinion so nobody get all belligerent or anything, says 'please come in! but don't stay long.'  dowtown chicago, btw, is awesome. tall buildings, amazingly clean, great public transportation system, and tulips everywhere!! love the location, not the school...  u of chicago: love the school, hate the location. southside chicago is what i'd call freaky-dickey. my mom and i were freaked out walking on the streets there in broad daylight. walking around past dark is basically suicide, even on campus. the surrounding area is as ghetto as it gets, and i now know that i'd never seen ghetto until i saw southside chicago. a damn shame cuz the campus itself is beatiful. i'm all up for new experiences, but i just can't imagine living in constant fear and incarcerating myself to the law school like that for three whole years...  u of michigan: has a very collegial feel to it. the law quad is the most beautiful place on campus. it's also very old. very. old. the res halls have a musty odor and communal, as opposed to private, baths. it was either that or the obese squirrels that did it in for me. seriously. ppl need to stop feeding those damn critters!!  okay. so having eliminated pretty much all the schools that i was seriously considering before my trip, based on the important criteria that you witnessed above, i'm back to my original first choice, that being cornell. i've always had a gut instinct that this was The One, and my gut instinct has rarely failed me (pls refer back to all my reality show predictions). it's funny cuz my mom said i'm picking the school just like i would a boyfriend, which is probably not far from the truth. anyway, now i just have to seal the deal with a visit, and sell my choice to el padres, aka...the Vault. man, that's gonna be one tough battle...  i need my sleep. g'nite y'all."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I'm still on eastern time. Last night I went drinking with  urlLink Alex  and I was super tired when I got home. I went to sleep at 10.  It's an interesting thing. I've never managed to get straight A's until grad school. I had pretty crappy grades in elementary school. I had a 3.69 in high school, but that was a result of the AP class GPA bonus. I was mostly a B+ student in high school. As an undergrad I finished with a 3.405 GPA. There were a few quarters where I managed to get straight A-'s. So anyway, this semester I managed to get straight A's for the first time ever.   I simply just never really cared about grades or working hard. Then again working hard and effor is all relative to how much you enjoy what you're doing.   Oh yea I had an interesting conversation with  urlLink Esther  the other day... it went something like...  Me: I wasn't about to go asking all the Asian women if they knew an Esther. Or wait they probably do, there are a lot of Asian Esthers. Esther: Yea but all of them are 'azn' or Christian. Me: There was another Albert Fu at UCI that's the exact opposite of me... super Christian Me: These people besmirch our names. Speaking of Alex and Esther, it strikes me that they along with many of my good friends do artsy stuff. Those two along with  urlLink Andy ,  urlLink Cissa , Brandon, and others are all doing cool stuff. It makes me think I should get back into doing artsy stuff.

Instead, I had a thought: what would the world be like if guys wore dresses and makeup, and girls wore gel and short hair?  I was just thinking - I gave myself a horrendous haircut (my mom's going to straighten it out later today).  I was massaging the shampoo in my hair, and I was thinking about A., and how he would look much better if he wore a little mascara to darken his long lashes, and then it hit me: what if the roles were reversed?  Anyway (I recently learned that anyways is not a word, and neither is irregardless - it's regardless ;D), I just wanted to write it down before I forgot it.  You know, it's nice having shorter hair.  I don't have to use as much conditioner, it takes a shorter amount of time to blow dry and straighten it (actually, I curl it at the ends; the minute amount of curl is usually gone by 1st period), and I can still wear my hair every way my mom said I couldn't wear it if I cut it shorter.  I can still braid it, wear it in a pony tail, curl it (although I slightly resemble my grandmother), put it in a bun, and wear a half ponytail.  Is it pony tail, ponytail, or pigtail?  Just wondering, why must we name hairstyles after animals?  Can't it be a tail?  News flash: since I don't want the psychos in the woodwork to go stalk the people in my life, I'm going to use first names or first letters when I'm talking about people.  For example, tomorrow, I'm going to ask my friend Ashley if she notices anything different - she'll stare at me for five minutes, then Monica will say, 'Wait I think it's her hair.'  Then she'll stare for another five minutes, and say, 'I think you're right.'  Then I'll grow tired of the charade, and tell them it's my hair.  The only sad thing about my hair is that I've lopped off most of the naturally blonde part.  My hair's hilighted from about an inch from the end up.

La entidad, que ya fue multada por violar leyes contra el lavado de dinero, dice que colaborar\u00e1 con la investigaci\u00f3n. Un informe elaborado tras una investigaci\u00f3n del ala dem\u00f3crata del Subcomit\u00e9 Permanente de Investigaciones del Senado, revela que un banco de Washington, el Riggs Bank, ha ignorado las medidas contra el lavado de dinero en EEUU en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os para conseguir negocios con dictadores extranjeros. Entre ellos se encuentran Augusto Pinochet, ex dictador de Chile, y Teodoro Obiang, dictador de Guinea Ecuatorial. El banco, prestamista de EEUU para la mayor\u00eda de las embajadas extranjeras y misiones en la capital del pa\u00eds, no inform\u00f3 a los reguladores bancarios de EEUU que estaba manejando cuentas de varios millones de d\u00f3lares de Pinochet, que gobern\u00f3 Chile entre 1973 y 1990, y de algunos altos funcionarios de la dictadura africana de Guinea Ecuatorial. En el caso de Pinochet, el informe precisa que 'altos funcionarios del Riggs Bank buscaron activamente' establecer negocios bancarios con \u00e9l y que tom\u00f3 medidas para ayudarle a ocultar sus fondos en el banco. El texto -del que inform\u00f3 ayer The Washington Post- revela que la entidad bancaria mantuvo esas cuentas para el dictador chileno incluso despu\u00e9s de que en octubre de 1998, un tribunal espa\u00f1ol publicase una autorizaci\u00f3n de detenci\u00f3n internacional para el dictador que alegaba, adem\u00e1s del asesinato, la tortura y el genocidio, que deb\u00eda congelar todas sus cuentas. De acuerdo con los senadores, el banco intent\u00f3 utilizar empresas y cuentas en el extranjero con nombres enga\u00f1osos para ocultar la conexi\u00f3n de las mismas con Pinochet. En los documentos que solicitaron los investigadores, el banco se refer\u00eda a Pinochet como 'un profesional jubilado' y con 'una alta posici\u00f3n en el sector p\u00fablico durante muchos a\u00f1os'. El informe indica que el ex dictador chileno ten\u00eda depositado en el Riggs entre 4 y 8 millones de d\u00f3lares, colocados en varias cuentas personales y corporativas. El coordinador de la defensa de Pinochet ha alegado que las supuestas cuentas en Estados Unidos son una calumnia. El estudio denuncia tambi\u00e9n que el banco abri\u00f3 al menos 60 cuentas para Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, dictador de Guinea Ecuatorial, su familia y funcionarios del gobierno. En este pa\u00eds africano, donde son conocidas la corrupci\u00f3n y la violaci\u00f3n de los derechos humanos, el Riggs Bank manej\u00f3 dep\u00f3sitos y pr\u00e9stamos de hasta 700 millones de d\u00f3lares. Antes de que sus cuentas fueran cerradas hace varios meses, era el mejor cliente de la entidad bancaria. Riggs ya pag\u00f3 una multa de 25 millones de d\u00f3lares a comienzos de este a\u00f1o para acabar con acusaciones de haber violado leyes federales contra el lavado de dinero. En un comunicado, la entidad no se refiere concretamente al informe parlamentario, pero ha asegurado que colaborar\u00e1 con la investigaci\u00f3n del Senado, la cual proporcionar\u00e1 un cuadro m\u00e1s detallado de como la entidad mantuvo tales cuentas sin alertar a los reguladores estadounidenses. El informe tambi\u00e9n levanta interrogantes sobre pagos de varias compa- \u00f1\u00edas petroleras, incluidas ExxonMobil y Marathon, a cuentas privadas controladas por l\u00edderes de Guinea Ecuatorial, por ello los funcionarios de aquellas empresas tambi\u00e9n declarar\u00e1n ante el Senado.

Why has middle america, the blue collar workers, the farmers etc gone republican when none of the policies they help the bastards enact benefit them in any way?  In the article he says:   'Nobody thinks it's strange that Nebraska and Nevada and Arizona and Montana vote for right-wing Republicans in election after election, consumed with tax-cutting fervor and a passion to shrink the government, even though it's the massive federal programs of the 20th century -- dams and aqueducts, agricultural subsidies, public lands thrown open to ranching and mining and lumbering -- that supports those states' economies to this day.'  Middle america is so jaded to the politics of economics (and rightfully so) that they base their decisions soley on cultural issues.  Anti-abortion, anti-evolution and the like.  And the republicans are slimey and perceptive and they mobilize the masses on these issues.  It's easy to point the finger at republicans but the article also takes aim at the Democratic party for its part in this debaucle:  'There are two different errors that were made, and both of them have amounted to jettisoning the working class, so that the working class is no longer the central focus of the party. In the McGovern era they described this as the 'new politics.' The error of that was apparent at the time, because McGovern went down in flames. The idea was, we'll build a new coalition around students, feminists, environmentalists and so on.'  The author mentions that both John Edwards and Howard Dean talked old-school populist politics early in this election and now John Kerry attempts to echo them but seems insincere.  I will vote for Kerry of course.  I have no choice.  I want someone other than Bush in the white house.  But I still have the Howard Dean sticker in the back window of my car.  Lots of people have told me to give it up; take it down.  I was lazy at first but finally I tried and found that the tape I used had melted to the window or something.  I can't get it off.

Eliminate the reason.  If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of 'They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!', and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S.

Having a girlfriend their made it a little better, but she's gotten kind of weird lately and she flirts with Daniel too much.  My time on stage is too scattered.  I don't have long blocks of time offstage.  The good thing is I only have to wear tights for two scenes.  They're not comfy. On a totally different note, I highly encourage you to read  Ishmael  by Daniel Quinn.  I cannot stress enough how important I think it is that everyone read this book.  I'm working on the sequel (parallel novel) and it's not bad, but the first is just overwhelming, and totally defies description.  Read it, then you'll know why.  That'll also explain what the title of this post means.  Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?\n\nText 2:I seriously feel like I have lived my whole life wanting something so bad that I can't have or will never get. I feel like I've set goals for myself that can never be accomplished by me. I know people say 'if you want something so bad, you'll get it' but it's not always true. For somethings I want I'm just not smart enough to get it, really I'm not, I think I may be sometimes because I have unbelieveably smart friends, but I need to realize I'm not one of those people. I also need to realize that I don't have money and my mom isn't made of money so I can't always get what I want it when comes to that sense. I just need to live in reality for like a day see things for how they really are.  On a side note though, yesterday, Saturday, has been the first good day I've had in like a billion years, ok so I exaggerate, but still. I've been sick for way too long and I've been sooooooo stressed out it's not even funny. I don't have time to sit down and relax with all the homework I have and hockey. But ya with hockey. It's been weird 'casue ever since I got sick I've been playing better, besides one game, which really shouldn't be the case 'cause I'm like hacking up who knows what while on the ice.... maybe that's scaring all the opponets away. But anywho yesterday we had a hockey game against Minnetonka, and ya right when I got to the rec my coach was like how do you feel and I'm like a lot better actually, I got 12 hours of sleep. So ya we don't have set lines on our team, but like right before warm ups the coach told us the lines, and ya she's like Oakes is with Frankie and Keseley..... and ya that would be first line, and I got to start with them and everything. It was tight and I've seriously never played so much in a game in my life and I actually could keep up and play hockey. It felt sooooo good! Playing how I did yesterday and not caring if I felt like I was gonna die, but just kept on going is what I love, and that just really makes me feel like I have a purpose of playing hockey adn that I don't suck.  How come you can feel so comfortable in someones arms, but not in someone elses? Seriously with all the guys that I've had like potential relationships with or what not, there's only been one guy that I've truely felt happy and comfortable with. I don't wanna leave their arms once I'm in them, I just wanna be like that forever. But the bad thing is this guy I know isn't good for me, he's not what I need, but what I want. There's so many issues between us and so many trust issues I have with him and our past has had so many ups, but probably more downs. I know all this, but when I'm with him it all leaves me. My heart takes over and my head isn't even there at that point. I still think that it's possible for soemthing to change in him and for something to happen, and ya it might, but I feel and think that every time, and it never happens. I want to be able to drift away from him and just say no leave me alone to him, but I can't. At this point I don't think it's possible for me to just walk away. I want to be with him and I don't even know why. All I know is that this feeling I get makes me so happy and makes me feel so good that I just don't want it to end. I just want him to know that when I'm in his arms and he kisses my head is different then anything else and any other feeling and I just want to stay in that moment with him forever. I want this so bad, but at the same time I know it'll probably just cause me more stress and trouble then before, but I just can't break out of it. I haven't been able to for a year. If anyone has any suggestions please tell me 'cause I'm stuck on him, I can't get over him and again he's something that I want, but probably can never have. But really when you want something so bad and you just can't let go, but you can never have it, when does that feeling of trying to obtain that one thing ever go away? If it's soemthing you strive for and wish for that completes your life how do you just let go of it like it's never had an impact on your life and it's never been apart of your life and it's never been half the reason you stay sane? I just can't do it.  Follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.  -joesph campbell  : )~KTO"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Deal with it.) and etc. I talked to Sarah who told mem not to go anywhere because she was coming to get me at 6ish Jonah then called me to ask for Sarah's phone number. I then, because I am me, fell asleep on the couch. Around 6:30 I woke up and realized that someone was calling my name, and of course, it was Sarah. I ran and got ready, then we (Sarah, Jane and I) went to Sarah's house. When we got there, they went in the house first, (and I was still oblivious...) and then Jane said, 'Alison!' I was like Alison's here? Then, I saw Nathan. I was like, Nathan's here? Then Jonah popped out.  I said, Jonah's here???? To be honest, I was quite suprprised to see Jonah and Nathan. It was a wonderful surproise though. And yeah. Much hilarity happened from there. Sarah has pictures, which she's told me that she'll give me copies of. She even has pictures of Nathan picking me up!

Advertising is everywhere.  It even dominates the vast majority of search engine results online.  Our students are not always the best at identifying commercial messages in the world.  This site has some good suggestions which could be incorporated into an information literacy curriculum.  From the site:  Advertising can be defined as communication which promotes the purchase of products and services, and advertisements are pervasive in the American culture. Ads are sandwiched between programs on television, interspersed with popular songs on the radio, and scattered among news features in the daily paper. While advertisements may distract from a TV program or a newspaper's other messages, might they also serve a more positive purpose? Can advertising advance consumer knowledge? At the same time, can consumer education help people become more knowledgeable and critical about the goals of advertising? This digest provides a basic overview of issues related to advertising and the consumer.   ADS ARE EVERYWHERE   People sometimes complain about the perceived overabundance of advertising in daily life. While consumers are accustomed to ads on television and in magazines, commercial promotion appears to be cropping up in more and more places. A proposed cable TV channel (Channel One) for use in schools faltered when it was learned that the channel would carry commercials aimed at the students, but it now appears to be heading for success, even though school administrators are divided on its merits (Rist, 1989). A profile of Channel One founder, Chris Whittle, in 'The New York Times' reported that, while many teachers and administrators extol the value of the newscast which Channel One presents, others will never accept the infusion of commercialism in the schools. Whittle, however, has already signed up the 8600 schools he needed to cover his capital costs and achieve the audience size he felt would interest advertisers (Kleinfield, 1991).  Advertising is also found in some of the free curriculum materials which businesses supply to schools. A content analysis of materials within the areas of nutrition, energy, and economics education revealed that business-sponsored materials were found to contain significantly more advertising statements than did non-business-sponsored materials. Additionally, sponsored materials contained significantly more references to brand names/models and more company/brand logos and names than did non-sponsored materials. Many educators believe that the value of these materials is suspect, because of the preponderance of the commercial message over the informational content (Rudd 1986).  Each time a new communications technology is developed, merchants are quick to devise ways of exploiting the medium for advertising purposes. Advertisers move rapidly to exploit the commercial possibilities of radio, television and cable. Facsimile machines are now used to transmit ads. Sports arenas' and stadiums' electronic scoreboards carry product names in yards-high lettering. The developing technologies of teletext, electronic mail, and interactive cable television are now being used to sell products as well. Research suggests that as a result of these developments, advertising is now less likely to contain meaningful product information, and more likely to be intermingled with other kinds of messages (Sepstrup 1986). Consumers, as the targets of these increasingly complex promotional strategies, must become much more aware of the persuasive nature of advertising.\n\nText 2:urlLink Technology Infrastructure and Information Literacy.  This is by Eugene A. Engeldinger.  It was published in  Library Philosophy and Practice  Vol. 1, No. 1 (Fall 1998).  From the site:  The fundamental purpose of higher education is the preparation of students for their futures. If graduates of today and tomorrow are to flourish in the modern, fast-paced, high-tech world, they must have information seeking and technology skills. They must be information and technology literate. The means of acquiring these literacies must be imbedded in student learning and be part and parcel of their educational experience. For this to be so imbedded, it is necessary for the institution to develop and maintain a robust information technology infrastructure.   Information Literacy   Information literate people have a number of qualities and skills. First of all, they recognize when they have an information need. This, as we all know, is not a quality possessed by everyone. They know the appropriate places to look for information, and they know the appropriate strategies to use for each of them. The information literate person has the ability to recognize the information when it is found, and then to determine if it is the best, most accurate, or most current information available.  Information literacy can combine various elements of library literacy, computer literacy, media literacy, network literacy and other literacies, but it should be noted that in the best educational experiences, students become more information literate in the natural course of learning subject content and research methodologies of the various disciplines they study.  Whether our institutions of higher learning expressly articulate it or not, they all want their graduates to have developed these competencies and many believe their students have done so. Even though all want their students to be information literate, few have specifically built the means of acquiring those skills into the curriculum. We are all aware that inculcating these competencies should be a curriculum-wide responsibility. But because of the differences in technical expertise among the faculty and the technical resources on our campuses, not all can contribute equally to the effort."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I was thinking of what mine have been over the years, so I thought I'd turn it into a Tuesday One.   What has been your strangest work request(s)?   This had to have been during my year stint with a MN-based company where I ran incentive programs.  The first program I ran (for a certain high-profile investment company) was in San Francisco.  It was a trip all the top sales people had won - all expenses-paid.  I was in charge of the VIP's for the 10 days (the CEO, his wife, and everyone in between).  The CEO was not happy with the toilet paper at the hotel.  Guess who had to get him some Charmin?  The CEO's wife had to go shopping.  Guess who had to hold her purse in the couture shops?  On a different program to Beaver Creek, CO we encountered a trip director's worst nightmare: virtually EVERYONE on the trip had lost their luggage.  It didn't matter what part of the country they came from - No one had clothes on the first day (some even went the whole week).  Of course, this was tragic to the women who had no make-up (or dresses, for that matter) for the first night's black-tie dinner, but we heard the biggest stink from the guy whose wife's BREAST PUMP was in their suitcase.  'I demand someone get us a new breast pump.  My wife and kid are dyin' here!'  I thought I'd vomit on the spot.  Guess who got elected for breast-pump-searching-duty in the middle of a resort town?  Yep, yours truly.  After searching all over town, we finally went to a local hospital and got your ol' run-of-the-mill breast pump.  When we gave it to the guy, you'd think he would have rejoiced.  'Thanks, but this doesn't look like the one she had.  I'll let you know.'  I had no idea there were so many varieties?  Needless to say, he came back unsatisfied.  'My wife demands a better one.  I don't care what it takes.  This one is killing her!'  Then I heard the best 'get your ass fired' quote from my coworker: 'Listen, Mr. So-and-So.  If you're expecting us to find a fur-lined breast pump it just ain't going to happen!  Tell her to deal with it.'  I promise if I'm ever rich, I will treat all people with dignity.

First I went to dinner with Tim, and then watched a movie.  It was a fairly enjoyable time.  Then Paul and I decided that we were bored, but that going out for a drink wouldn't hurt.

Well we ended up at Star Bar (which isn't meant for one drink, and there's no sitting or relaxing), arrived around midnight, and then like 8 to 10 drinks later (mind you, it was double strength drink night), befriending the bartender (Chris), getting free shots, and just living it up.  Wow.  I mean, wow.  Wow.  I can't even begin to type about it all.  And hey, we got to see Crazy Dancing Asian Guy, and Chris informed us that Crazy Dancing Asian Guy's proper name is the 'Asian Sensation.'

This is an ERIC Digest on information literacy.  It tries to cover information literacy at several levels including K-12, higher education, and the economic impact on the workforce.  From the site:  'The inclusion of information competencies as a graduation requirement is the key that will fully integrate information literacy into the curricula of academic institutions.'   'Information literacy instruction in higher education can take a variety of forms: stand-alone courses or classes, online tutorials, workbooks, course-related instruction, or course-integrated instruction.'   'State-wide university systems and individual colleges and universities are undertaking strategic planning to determine information competencies, to incorporate instruction in information competence throughout the curriculum and to add information competence as a graduation requirement for students.'   'Academic library programs are preparing faculty to facilitate their students' mastery of information literacy skills so that the faculty can in turn provide information literacy learning experiences for the students enrolled in their classes.'

It examines what school counselors need to know about ADD and ADHD.  From the ERIC Digest:  Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity (ADD) or with Hyperactivity (ADHD) continues to be a misunderstood diagnosis by many. Some parents and teachers still hold a perception that the label simply provides an excuse for disruptive behavior; however, studies continue to support a biochemical or organic basis to the disorder.    Presentation of symptoms can be affected by family interactions, school expectations, and other demands placed on the individual child. Part of the reason that attention deficit is usually diagnosed in school age children (e.g., first to third grade) is attributable to the demands placed on the child when beginning school (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000). The structure at school differs from that in the home or preschool environment.    Typical predisposing factors within the individual, as well as in the family history, are being identified in the literature (Chi and Hinshaw, 2002). For example, a history of alcoholism, smoking, or depression in parents can be predisposing factors (Mick, Biederman, Faroane, Sayer, and Kleinman, 2002). Certain physiological markers, such as frequent early ear infections (Combs, 2002), have also been associated with the presentation of attention deficit. Physical complications can be a factor in the development of language and reading disabilities that are associated with attention deficit for between 45% and 60% of those diagnosed (Lloyd, Hallahan, Kauffman, and Keller, 1998)."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Its Sunday night and I still have homework to do and yet I still found time for you all. Aren't you happy? School is one big bust. I cant stand it! Im sure many of you out there feel the same way too. But im just not having a good time. I never have. I know, I know school isn't about having fun. But don't most of you have fun while in school? Well I don't. Even lunch is a hassle! I rarely eat it anymore. Just a couple fries here maybe a Whatchamacallit (its a candy bar) there. Also Im still failing that chemistry class. All I need is one percent though then ill be right at sixty percent... heh that will be the day.      My inner child is sixteen years old!    Life's not fair!

I wonder. I am sixteen so does that automatically mean my inner child is sixteen? Nah couldn't be. I went to the mall today I bought a fake flower to put in my hair. It looks pretty nice. I like it. I think I might wear it Monday.  I went to Edgefest last weekend the (20th of September)! It was fuckin' insane! I had a blast! I had more fun than when I went to the Warped Tour. Probably because I was with different people. It was a local radio station who did it. It wasn't at all like Warped Tour. The only thing I wished were there was more booths. Warped tour had plenty. But Edgefest was lacking in the booth section. I got a free Fourbanger CD! They are definitely great. They have an Emo thing goin on or at least I think so. I like Emo and some metal but I think I told you that.   Its ten and I should be going so I can think about doing homework. God im so lazy. I've never been good at school either. I've always been a C or lower student. Its sad really. I never even made honor roll until fifth grade. That was the first and last time too. I haven't made it since.

I'm still wearing my pajamas. Smugness.  I have to agree with Michael in that there should be two youth groups. I'm personally not much of a youth group person in that I keep my religious things very private, and the whole 'let's all hold hands and pray and quote Bible verses and sing songs with total strangers' thing kind of makes me uncomfortable. But I think it would be much better if there was a younger group who could do that, and an older group that could be more self-directed... like, we know the Bible stories already, what do we think about them?

We were catching up on things, but much to our consternation my phone kept losing reception in the middle of the conversation.  Finally, the reception seemed to be fine, until I walked off of the dock that I didn't notice.  'I'll call you back!  I fell into the water!'  Jamming the phone into my pocket, I slackened my limbs and began to float upon my waterproof bookbag.   The current drifted me towards the dock; seizing the opportunity, I pulled myself up onto dry ground.  Everything was intact with exception of my hat, which had blown off as I had fallen in.    'My BABY!' screamed a thirty-something woman.  The toddler had just fallen into the dock as well, her last known words being a cheerful, 'I love you, mommy!'  The woman had sat absorbed in her studies until she heard her baby's splashing.  I stood thinking of the person with whom I had just been talking.  I walked to my campus, found a spot with good reception and gave a call.  Ring one.  Ring two.  Ring three.   I can't believe this person would be mad at me, when I had just risked drowning.   Ring four.  Ring five, and the phone picked up.  'Hello?  Hey, I had fallen off the dock, I had to rescue myself from the water!'  No answer greeted me but the sounds of a group of friends aimlessly chatting.  'Hello? Are you there?'  I gave up after a couple more tries, and walked to my dorm.  The RA greeted me.  'Tim, you fear that you don't have any skills, that you had wasted all of your time here, but I believe in you.  We're going to hold a meeting soon to campaign for the school to abstain from knocking this dorm down next year.'  Nodding, I walked to the dorm lounge and sat at the bar counter.  The residents piled in and sat in a circle.  We had our meeting, and I requested we close with our respective prayers.  The Jewish guy next to me sneered and told me to refrain from shoving my belief in Christ upon them.  Startled, I sat back, but we still had the time of prayer."], "gold_label": 0.0}

This is from the last 10 minutes of my day at Crazy's yesterday.  Note to Crazy: If you tell me what your day's schedule is like, maybe you wouldn't have to tell me we're in a hurry all the time. Yes, I am always on time, but only if I know what time to be wherever it is that I need to be. You don't tell me at 3:52 that you are supposed to meet a student on campus at 4:00. You live 12 minutes (when I'm speeding and there are no stoplights or traffic) from campus. What's that? You have a package that needs to go out today from FedEx? Oh, well, I'll just turn back time and make sure it gets to the FedEx drop by 4pm. Nevermind it is across town and I have to take you to campus first. Nevermind it's 8 minutes to 4. No, I'm a miracle worker, I can do it. I'm superwoman! Sure, we can stop at the computer store to pick up a new mouse. No problem. I'll just put time on pause for about 20 minutes and we'll get there no problem.  Oh, you want me to drag that dry cleaning (the same dry cleaning I dragged up the stairs the other day, complete with a left shoulder that felt like it was being set on fire and stabbed all at once, but no worries. you not hurting yourself is FAR more important than me not hurting myself anymore than I already am) back to the closet? Why didn't you tell me that when I was dragging the shit upstairs the other day? 'No, we can just leave it sit here on the kitchen floor and Charlie will take care of it.' Okay, so why didn't he take care of it? I saw him there, he was eating a bowl of soup. He didn't look too busy to put away the damn dry cleaning. And Charlie? Let's not egg me on by asking why we haven't left yet, because we're going to be late. That will only lead to me hitting you in the head with my fist. Okay? Good. Why is it that you, Charlie, can't drag your wife to campus? You're not doing anything at all today. I'm pretty sure those are flannel pants I see you wearing, and that it's clear you slept in that tshirt. Oh, and when I'm pounding on the door with my head because I have both hands full of her crap, could you maybe tear yourself away from the television and open the door? That'd be great.  Oh, what's that, Crazy? You want me to find your blue pants for you? Any idea where they are? Oh, they're in the closet. Okay. Oh, you want me to bring you a blue shirt to go with them? You do realize these don't look at all good together, right? You do? Well, then why are you wearing them together? With your ugly black Nikes. And white socks. You realize you embody the very image of a pain in the ass professor, right? Oh, you do, well, at least you know it. What's that, Charlie? You need a sandwich? Um, get off your ass and get it yourself. I don't work for you, so fuck off.  Okay, it's 3:59 now, you think you're ready to go yet? Oh, you are? Oh, you haven't combed your hair yet? Um, you do know that nobody can tell, right? You look like that all the time. Okay, let's go. We ready? We are? Are you sure? Oh, you have a garbage bag of things for me to take to campus with you? Okay, yeah, we can do that. Why do people carry their non-garbage items in garbage bags? I just don't get it. It's not garbage, but if it's in a big black garbage bag, it's going in the garbage. Buy some luggage, or a nice shoulder bag or something. Because that would make sense. Oh, nevermind, you don't ever make sense. No, Charlie, I am not bringing you a sandwich. No, Charlie, when I take her to school and get her other errands done, I'm going home. Where people are sane. Yes, Charlie, you're going to have to make your own sandwich tonight.\n\nText 2:Whoever it was that thought moving home was a good idea was clearly having a delusional moment.  So much to bitch about and so little time to do so.  I finally hear snoring from the parental bedroom, meaning no one will be wandering in here in the next three and a half minutes, giving me just enough time to let people know that I did make it here alive.  I can't guarantee I'll leave that way.  I'll have to wait until Wednesday to give all the juicy (read: fucking annoying) details, because on Wednesday evening, both mom and dad have meetings so I'll have the place to myself for a couple hours.  I would imagine there will be a flurry of phone calls, IMs, emails, and postings on here at that time, so keep a look out for that.  As for the job, so far, so good.  The first day started with a 2 hour late start on account of a busted water mane.  Day two is going to start 2 hours late on account of the fucking miserable windchills (how does 50 below strike your fancy?  Yeah, mine isn't struck either).  Guess who isn't doing her morning run tomorrow.  Go on, guess.  That's right.  Even I have enough sense to stay the hell out of that kind of frigidity.  Hey, Iowa won their bowl game.  Perhaps the biggest shock of the bowl season.  At least it certainly was to Ron Zook.  You bet your ass you got out-coached, punk.  Remember that next time your guys are still talking smack when they're down 20 points.  Y'all didn't stand a snowball's chance in Miami of winning that game as soon as you underestimated the coaching staff.  Oh, and saying that PK Nate Kaeding was a really great wide receiver helped things along quite well, don't you think?  Bonehead.  Okay, now I need to go to bed so I can be well rested for another day of dodging mom (she's making me crazier than I already was) and shortened work schedules.

According to the study, only 4 out of 100 Swedes are interested in starting a business or have recently started one. The same number for the US are 12 and top scorer Uganda 29.  Reynolds mentions the size of the public sector, the unemployment benefit schemes and that the population share of younger people are getting lower. Now, regardless of what you think of the welfare state and the size of it (personally, I more or less side with Friedrich Hayek on that issue) the government needs a stable source of income, and if the welfare state harms the entrepreneurship you'll have to ask yourself whether or not the welfare state in the long run actually helps the poor.  urlLink Tyler   urlLink Cowen  have  urlLink written  on that issue.\n\nText 2:Saddam Hussein wants to spend the time before his trial  urlLink in a Swedish prison . Saddam's lawyer says:     'Prisons in Sweden seem to be more comfortable than in other places. Besides, Sweden has historically been a neutral country.'     Well, he could have added that the Swedish prisons seem to have revolving doors, you're free to pass in and (mostly I guess) out whenever you want by the look of it. Last wednesday, four dangerous criminals escaped from the prison Hall, south of Stockholm. One of them, Tony Olsson, and two others killed two policemen five years ago after running away from a bank rob. One of the other escapees, Daniel Mairona, escaped from another prison, Kumla, last winter and from Hall two years ago.  Luckily, the police force made a good job and all four of them got caught pretty soon. What followed naturally was a debate on the security of the prisons in Sweden. But that debate obviously didn't lead to anything.  Because just about an hour ago, four other criminals  urlLink escaped from the prison in Norrt\u00e4lje , north of Stockholm. All these prisons, Kumla, Hall and Norrt\u00e4lje, are supposed to be high security prisons. After the escape last week, the opposition called for the minister of justice to resign. Will he do it now?   Update:  I was wrong, it was three inmates who escaped from Norrt\u00e4lje today, not four.  An interesting feature though is that one of the escapees, Peter Bottany, is the chairman of the National Trust Council who works for the sake of the inmates. Another interesting feature is that Bottany and three others wrote an article in one of the biggest Swedish newspaper,  urlLink Dagens Nyheter , last friday. The headline to the  urlLink article  is 'The isolated gets desperate'(Isolerade blir desperata).  More:    The aim [of the correction system] must reasonably be to create a change among the convicted, not to break them down mentally so that they act desperately.     Yes, I agree. But I'm puzzled since the one who wrote this escaped himself five days later. Does that mean that Bottany (who studies psychology while imprisoned) was desperate when he and the others wrote the article? Not unlikely. The escape as such sounds well planned. They were helped by three masked and armed men from the outside. Also, the getaway car is registered on an inmate at Norrt\u00e4lje so they got some help from people on the inside as well. The plans must have been made before last friday.   Update 2 (9th August):  One of them got caught yesterday afternoon and the two others early this morning."], "gold_label": 1.0}

The cause of death is undetermined.  I saw Smith this summer, and while I'm really glad I did when I got the chance, I remember both Mike and I commenting that he really looked  not well . At the time, we thought he was very drunk, but who knows.  Smith is best known for his 1997 Academy Award nomination for the song 'Miss Misery,' which was featured on the Good Will Hunting Soundtrack. He also contributed music to the wonderful film the Royal Tenenbaums, and I think his music fits in perfectly with Wes Anderson's brother Eric's whimsical  urlLink drawings .  My favorite Elliott Smith song is probably 'In the Lost and Found.' It's melancholy and full of longing and just very beautiful. Here's a  urlLink review  of Figure 8, the album that song is on.  UPDATE: I hate to link to MTV, but they seem to have the most current information. It looks like his death is an  urlLink apparent suicide .\n\nText 2:I had somewhat of a breakdown this morning.  I saw John today because he finally came to get his car.  And seeing him just put me in a foul mood.  That's not a good sign.  So that was that, we didn't really talk, I just told him to call me when he gets home from work.  But we all know by now that won't happen.  I just want this to be done.  But we won't get into it right now.  I called my mom today and I could barely talk to her.  I was almost in tears, just about everything.  I have my days, but today was bad.  I didn't think I was going to be able to stop crying.  I just wasn't feeling strong today, I told my mom I wanted to come home.  I shouldn't have said that.  She just told me to keep my chin up.  Then she told me a story about my 4 year old niece and I was cracking up.  That's the stuff I miss.    Funny story.  Last night Shelly and I went to get some movies, and I wanted popcorn, but when I got home I realized it was Kettle corn, and I just wasn't in the mood for that.  I wanted something really buttery, so I made her take me back to the store.  We were outside looking at Christmas trees, and I totally tripped over some cement slap and twisted my knee.  How stupid is that?  Yeah I hurt myself looking at trees.    I ate so much sugar last night.  I don't know what it was.  I just wanted sugar.  But anyway, we watched movies last night.  Well I actually watched about 4 movies, because I am an insomniac.  Pirates of the Caribbean.  Good movie.  At first I was a little weirded out about Johnny Depp, but then I was pleasantly surprised.  He was really good in this movie.  Then we watched Old School, and then I watched Serendipity, and then I watched Pulp Fiction, but I fell asleep through that.    So one thing I love about California, is all the bathrooms have toilet seat covers.  I love that.  In Illinois you were lucky to find a bathroom with those things.  Public bathrooms are just so disgusting.  I hate them.  We were in Wal-Mart today and I had to pee, so I went in, and I just cringed.  But I opened one of the stalls and there is the toilet seat cover dispenser!  Thank you soooo much!    Ok, I gotta go, I am rambling on about nothing."], "gold_label": 0.0}

To struggle in a morass of one's own making. 'After I defined the self as a relation that relates to itself relatingly, I bubered around for three pages.' Hence buber, n. one who bubers. 'When my mistake was pointed out to me, I felt like a complete buber.'   derrida . From a old French nonsense refrain: 'Hey nonny derrida, nonny nonny derrida falala.'   gadam , v. To expound the meaning of abstruse writings, dreams, arcane and necromantic symbols, and the rest of the universe, in ways pleasing to the humanist. Hence, gadamer, n. one who gadams. Hence, also the adjective, gadam, gadamer, gademest, of or pertaining to the activity of gadaming. 'I done my gadamest.'   heidegger , n. A ponderous device for boring through thick layers of substance. 'It's buried so deep we'll have to use a heidegger.'   kripkography , n. The opposite of cryptography: the art of translating a meaningless message (about, e.g., de re necessity) into expressions that an uninitiated observer would take to be straightforwardly meaningful (e.g., 'Look, it's not so hard. All he's saying is that since the term is a rigid designator, it refers to the same thing in all possible worlds'). 'He used to claim he just 'couldn't understand' essentialism, but now, thanks to kripkography, he just sits there nodding and smiling.'    kuhn , n. A fox often mistaken for a hedgehog; it is usually attended by such a commotion that it appears more than twice as heavy as it really is.    mctaggart , n. A black hole which not only sheds no light but in which time stands still. 'Some mctaggarts are rather broad.'   moore , v. To try to win an argument by taking something out of your pocket. 'I couldn't think of anything to say so I hauled off and moored him.'   rort , n. m. (1) an incorrigible report; hence, rorty, adj. incorrigible. n. (2) Fashionable but confused discourse. 'Don't talk rort.'   taylor , v. (in the idiom, to taylor the argument) To defend an absurd position or conclusion by inventing equally absurd premises or inferences; as in. 'It's easy to get a proof of fatalism if you know how to taylor the argument.' Also, taylor's dummy, an absurd principle on which to hang bits of metaphysical nonsense. My hope is that someday I will make an important contribution to philosophy and be immortalized by a silly pun in the philosophical lexicon.  I would encourage readers to come up with their own creative entries and post them in the comments.\n\nText 2:Its amazing how some of the littlest things can change your point of view.   I've been in a much better mood lately {which unfortunately means less to write about...}  and I can't decided if its because of the lovely weather, or because of Sean.  Probably both.  and the other day Mr. Thomas suggested that he thinks going to MU {University of Missouri, Columbia} would be really good for me.  His opinion means a lot to me.  Therefore, I am going to visit there next week, during spring break. He also said that one of the photos I took for the issue that's coming out tomorrow is the best I've had published all year.    Tonight I went to a Lenten prayer service at church.  They played a video on poverty around the world.  It was terribly depressing.  If I give up all the things I own, how would that help the  people who live in garbage dumps in South America?  Could I sell my car, and donate the money from it, and the gas money I would save to a charity?  I don't think I could.   I'm too selfish.  The thought makes me sick to my stomach.   I do feel a little less stressed though...  I got some good prayer time in.  I always feel so much cleaner after I've prayed.  Lately, my prayers have just been letting my thoughts flow through my head,  opening them to God, and dwelling on people who I care about,  who need my prayers, and who I am thankful for.  Then I've fallen into my faults.  I wish there was some way I could force myself to be more selfless.  I want to exist soley for the good of others, but somehow I always fall back to doing things for my own good, and taking care of my wants.  I feel guilty for wanting so many things, especially when I know how little they really matter.  I also feel guilty for needing so much attention.  So much of what I do is to get the attention and compliments of others.  Does any of the good I do for this  purpose even really count?  I talk about people behind their backs, and I judge people based on the way they look or talk.    Honestly?  I think I really am a terrible person. God help me."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I was stung by a nettle and scratched by planks of wood (very rural stuff). When we got home me and mum popped the pea and bean pods. I believe I have pea popping genes (now that would be funny if they were pea popping jeans!). Anyway, I only have one other story, I think. Yesterday night, around 11pm, I was watching TV in the living room and happened to look out the window (that wasn't the story, just the build up) the security light came on outside the Toman's house and this person was walking around looking around the bins, at the door and then started waving this big stick in the air. At first I had a funny feeling that it could have been a burglar but then I thought only a very stupid burglar would wave a huge stick around in the air. Mum opened the window and shouted out to it. Then a large afro appeared, closely followed by James. He had got home without a key and no-one was in so he thought he would amuse himself with a large stick. Oh well, not everyone can be a genius.

Referring to his Feb. 5, 2003 appearance before the U.N.s Security Council, when he argued that Iraq had or was close to developing WMD, including biological weapons, Powell told Russert the information he offered was not only wrong, but that in some cases the intelligence cited by the administration had been purposefully misleading.   'It turned out that the sourcing was inaccurate and wrong and, in some cases, deliberately misleading,' Powell said. 'And for that, I am disappointed and I regret it.'\n\nText 2:Sorry...

I could barely stand being there, but for some reason I wanted to stay.

I looked up the etymology in www.dictionary.com, and indeed, it comes from 'to God.'  It is synonymous with the french farewell, 'adieu,'  and both are derived from the Latin 'ad deus.'

As Panda mentioned, I'm currently in NYC staying with my bro/sis-in-law (aka 'my peeps') for the week.  Last evening Panda and I walked by a trendy-looking bar at about 5:30pm.  There were a few people inside, baracades at the ready outside, and big promotional posters for a certain heartthrob's new CD by the entrance.  Seems we had stumbled upon a party for Nick Carter (aka a Backstreet Boy and Britney's rumored new squeeze for those not in-the-know).  We flirted with the idea of waiting a few hours for the chance to scream at Nick and his party people as they arrived to celebrate his fantastic new release.  But then we went into a non-trendy bar around the corner and had beers.  I don't regret our choice (yet).  While here, I've been enjoying the HBO provided by my hosts.  I saw the Sopranos (yes, it's great) and it was weird to see it only a day after it originally aired.  I'm used to being way behind on it (and Sex in the City, too) as I catch it on DVD.

It was pretty fitting for what I've been going through recently (see below);  I think one of the best suggestions it had was to go through Romans 6.  Understanding that one is forgiven for sins is one thing... living life in freedom from sin's grasp is another.  I know there's a lot of things that I have problems with, but God's surely working on them.  One thing I noticed that I have to deal with is to cut off my over-dependence upon relationships for emotional support.  It doesn't mean that I want to be a loner now, but God's been showing me how I tend to go to people first with my problems or if I'm feeling lonely, rather than spending time with Him first...  Anyhow, tonight is going to be a busy night of studying.  I'm skipping out on hanging out tonight with Jimmy Su, G, and Jolene at Joe's Crab Shack down at Gaithersburg, MD, in order to get work done.  I have a feeling that Jimmy's not too happy about that... 'you better get work done within those 3-4 hours.'  He meant it. Sorry Jimmy.

This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in 'auto run' and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.\n\nText 2:then i must admit that we are all very sexy people - good for us!"], "gold_label": 1.0}

A nice, medium-bodied smoke that went along fairly well down to about 1.5' after that is was time to throw in the towel. I was getting a noticeable 'buzz' by the time I was about 2/3rds of the way through. The ash formed quite uniformly and I could get 3/4' or so before I needed to tap or it left on its own. Once I was down to the last 1/3 I started getting what seemed to be 'perfumey' aftertastes but I was quite sure what it was.  All in all I thought it was a nice smoke but maybe a bit too aggresive for my tates. I find that the more cigars I sample, the more I am drifting towards the milder end of the spectrum. One of the downsides to this cigar has been the very pronounced 'cigar-breath' aftertaste. As of this writing I have eaten fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, milk, cookies and juice. I have brushed my teeth and had two bouts with a Listerine clone. It has also been about 5 hours since I finished my cigar and I STILL taste the thing like I just finished it. I can also still 'smell' it as I exhale through my nose.  The mild ones, like the Don Diego are like a polite guest: They know when they are about to overstay their welcome and leave accordingly.

It's kind of cool that you can either help or inspire or reassure people who you have never met and never will meet with just a few words graffitied on the internet.  I'm glad she took the time to send me an email.  I vaguely remembered the post she was talking about, so I searched until I found it.   urlLink This is the post on moodymama  that she read and my comments are farther down.  Take a minute to read it or you won't understand the rest of what I am about to say. Done? Ok. I spent years in hell.  YEARS.  In HELL.  I thought I was crazy.  Thought I should be locked up somewhere.  And it just got worse and worse and worse.  When I was pregnant with Willa and the year after I had her, I was seriously considering Red River.  I had been bad in years past.  Breaking things, raging and raging.  Hurting myself mostly.  Physically anyway.  Emotionally myself and others.  Now, I knew a lot of it was due to my hormones, because the worst of it would hit before my period, it was bad during and some after.  It was a vicious cycle.  The week before my period I was like a land mine.  Set and ready to go off and who knew when or on who it would go off.  I was temperamental and irritable and hostile.  There were times when I literally saw red.  It was like the 'dragon' had possessed me and I could feel the rage and hate overtaking me until I wasn't there anymore.  Then, when I started my period... I was depressed.  Crying constantly, getting my feelings hurt over and over for nothing.  Then the week after my period, that was the worst.  Suicidal, feelings of worthlessness, why should I live I am a horrible person I wish I would just die please God just take me now and get it over with.  I dreamed of dying, killing myself, being killed in some random accident.  Fantasized about it.  And this went on for years.  From the time I was 13 or 14 until I was 31 years old, progressively getting worse and worse.  I had times when it wasn't so bad.  But that could all change in a moment.  It was always there, lurking.  Since I've had the hysterectomy I have been a different person.  Oh sure, I have my moods.  But that's life.  Now I have a handle on them and can discern between real emotion and the irrational, out-of-control monster that had overtaken my emotions.  Stress is gonna happen.  But when it is coming from inside of you... what do you do?  Especially when you can't control it.  I had taken pills upon pills upon pills to no avail.  If it had gone on the way it was headed, who knows where I would be now.  And I had pretty much forgotten all of that.  Well, not forgotten but pushed to the back of the memory vault.  Who wants to remember horrible stuff?  So, I am glad that woman read my words and took a moment to write me about them.  It was a great reminder.

I'm really setting my sights on a job that I can get rather than a job I want, so with lowered standards I will leave the companies unnamed. I am holding to my standards of working in place that does not require me to wear a hat.  Here's my point: one electronic application was really weird: after asking for the basics, there were 70 true/false questions that sounded like a personality test. Most of the questions were stuff like, 'Sometimes it okay to steal something small.' 'Everyone has shoplifted in their adult life.' Evidently not stealing is very important! Also, there were twenty or so questions that were multiple choice to describe myself and my work habits. This part I worry about if they are looking for contradictions (I checked logical and creative; rule-follower and self-starter; etc.). So many questions! Hopefully I'll get a call; it worries me when there's no personal interaction to apply. Not like that has worked for me so far!  Television update: I'm suffering through the American Idol tryouts, just waiting for the final contestants to battle it out. I also suffered through Average Joe. I say suffered because I'm less interested in the guys fighting than seeing the losers interact with the girl. I need to catch last week's Newlyweds. Actually, there was one television-related question in the true/false section, probably to catch the people who don't change the preset answer from true to false: 'I have never watched television or used a telephone.' Without changing the answer, the company would see 'True' as a person's response. Tricky!\n\nText 2:Okay, so it seems like everyone is my boss these days. Pretty much true. Anyway, when I was hired at CC the store director was out, so I just interviewed with the sales manager and operations manager. When I met the store director, even though I was hired, he wanted to ask me a few interview style questions. Of course, I was not in interview mode, but rather in make friends with the associates mode, so my answers were silly and not well contrived. Yes, contrived. Anyway, I'll get to my point soon enough. This was more than a week ago, so it's not a big deal, besides just my innocent honesty getting me into trouble.  Erik: 'why'd you want to leave your other job?' Me: 'they'd only schedule me two days a week and then call me in if it got busy' Erik: 'we'll give you more than two days a week.' Me: 'it's just the unpredictability of running like that. plus I can't lift the water bottles' Erik: 'water does weigh eight pounds a gallon'  Anyway, I've been thinking about that conversation more, because there should have been other reasons. Any reason, talking about the Union, lack of mental challenge, dirty food, you name it -- it would have been better. I'm just glad I didn't mention problems with customers. I'm still in customer service.  So, when I talk to Dave tomorrow, I'll have to be careful. I might very well tell him I'm unhappy in Philly, because a large part of all of this has been mental drain. I will not tell him that I've never had a job for more than three months and his three months is past. Seriously, I've only been working there three months as of June 23.

However I made a major mistake! Anyone that runs a website knows that you play around with images and pages all the time and if you want to save it to see how it deploys and then ax it, you get an accumulation of images and files that don't link to anything and just clutter up your space. So I took to cleaning all these out with my new slimmer design and went into my Earthlink folder over the net to delete the old site and then upload the new one.   I blaim this on Windows XP actually, which groups all your Network Places together.. and on my coffee for not being strong enough to keep my brain functioning.. but somehow I managed to click on my local network website and began deleting all I could see in preparation to upload the brand new site I was deleting. I'm sure if someone wanted to come up with a recursion algorithm for this loop it would be impressive, but either way I caught what I was doing after having successfully deleted the Think Tank. Because I was deleting these files through my network interface to my site from Network Neighborhood... that's right.. no recycle bin! So, turns out I had visited a lot of the new Think Tank layout in my browser, so I painfully went through my Temporary Internet Files and grabbed the html and images out of the folder and recreated the directory structure. Some articles are gone forever in the Technology section. I'm not that hurt.  So far today I've been slurping down hot tea and working on my website. I remember having a lot to do on my TODO list and I guess now is the time to start on them.\n\nText 2:Showdown with Saddam...  momentarily      By now most people know that 40 minutes ago Iraq agreed to allow weapons inspectors back into their country, although this is only in writing and we have not tested this out presently. Regardless, as usual I find the fun in between the lines. Here in the USA the state of our news media is horrible. We don't have a BBC anymore, CNN has got swallowed up by AOL and is competing for the glitz and fiz that MSNBC offers. A case in point is what just happened on TV. When Iraq said they would allow in weapon inspectors at 7:00pm, MSNBC had a program on called... wait for it... 'showdown with Saddam'. From my brief stay on the channel I saw someone reflecting on the gulf war and the problems they faced. War is all but impossible now, and perhaps Bush will put down his war machine and go about looking at home... not that one would blaim him for trying to distract us by facing us always abroad, he sucks when it comes to his own country.  However I find it funny first that the US news media was so quick to embrace this idea of war to such an extent as to make a TV special about it, but second that they were basically outdone, like George Bush was, by the swift change in foreign affairs. They essentially were caught looking shameful, as usual.   What is more frustrating is that while BBC World & CNN were faithfully doing interviews and flashing news alerts about it... MSNBC... well... the people who break into to programming to announce a traffic accident in Idaho... they were still showing 'Showdown with Saddam'. No commentary, no breaking news, nothing. Poor guys.. I'm sure they are crying in their control rooms over the lost ratings. Maybe they just can't let the dream of Ashley Banfeld in a flack jacket once again fade away.

And they debate, that running away is bad, because your problems will eventually come back to haunt you, and the conclusion was that he wasnt running away, he was running to his problems, rather making his life more interesting with every second that he spends.  Sometimes, with all of my set 'life-plans' I want to not forget, that I cant live in--what will happen in the future, but rather in this moment. I never want to be the girl who is uncontent with this moment, because I cant wait for the next moment.  Could that free-lance thinker help me run away.

However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  '  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  '  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning."], "gold_label": 1.0}

The week before vacation, a suspected car thief was arrested in our back yard and trashed Mrs. Duf's garden while cursing and waking up TinyDuf at 3 a.m.  Five officers were involved in the hunt, and none of them can distinguish echinacea from weeds.    The next day, the suspected car thief's girlfriend came to our house (our address is a matter of public record) looking for 'keys' that her boyfriend 'dropped' in our yard while hiding out from the police officers (before being found by a bad ass police dog).  The police came by soon after her and said that his keys were included among the items they checked into holding when he was taken to jail.  Their theory:  he dropped drugs in our yard.  I was out of town during the whole affair.  While we were on vacation, our credit card company called and told us that they suspected fraud on our account. Some sucka was charging up a storm (including an $1100 Texaco charge) on our card.  Last night, someone broke into our garage.  All three of our bikes were stolen (including the one I bought Mrs. Duf for Mother's Day this year - it's been ridden twice), our garage people door was damaged severely, and my wife's car stereo was stolen (DJS, I like the way you gave the gift to DJ LZ, and perhaps I will do that too someday to replace her stolen stereo (JK)).    While on vacation, we cleaned out our garage, and among the items we threw away...her old car stereo!  My response to all of this misadventure is almost as upsetting to me as the events themselves. I:  1.  Want to move to a better neighborhood; 2.  Have been spinning theories about who stole our credit card and who broke into our garage, and it is someone I know; 3.  Have been feeling guilty about traveling so much because I have these testosterone driven (and illogical) notions that if I were home, Mrs. Duf would be safer.   4.  Have been thinking about getting a home security system; and  5.  Have been re-examining the propriety of traveling so much and questioning the balance between providing for my family in a job I love (making a good living) and being home more often (even if it means that I earn less money).  This balancing act is a near constant struggle for me.    But mostly I have been thinking about being a better provider and buying a house in a better place so that when I am gone, everyone will be safer.  Our current plan for moving is a 3 year plan.  This will allow us to make home improvements, and it will allow us to be better positioned to buy a house that we can live in for a lenthy (nod to DJS) amount of time (we will save, increase income and decrease expenses (bye bye daycare ($1000 per month), hello public schools ($0 per month)).  But with all these happenings, I wonder if we should not scramble and stretch and just get the hell out of our part of the city now.  No answer seems correct."], "gold_label": 0.0}

A: Ummm..where did we leave off? Oh yeah, you had said that you can relate to characters in modern literature more because they can experience things that you do. But the reason classic literature has survived so long and people still love it, is that the characters, even though they don't experience the same things we do, they at least experience the same emotions, which ties the centuries together.  C: I agree with you that classics have survived this long, but we need NEW old classics, so that in a century from now people will look at modern stuff and call it classic. Also in classic lit you have to think of reasons why you can relate to them, but in modern books its obvious. So why waste brain juice? (in case you didn't notice that\u2019s really my only good point so I'm sticking to it)  A: Ok, first, I totally agree with you that we need \u201cNEW old classics\u201d (and I intend to write them.) But in centuries from now, according to your theory, people will relate to modern literature. How can that be? Centuries from now things will be different and people just like you will say, \u201cI don\u2019t like classic literature from the 21st century, I can\u2019t relate to it, the people in those books don\u2019t do anything like we do and I can\u2019t relate to them.\u201d The idea of classic literature is that it has themes and emotions that despite the circumstances carry on because we\u2019re all human and that is they only thing that doesn\u2019t change throughout the centuries. Modern literature is much more action oriented, with plot coming before character, which makes it very unlikely that they will be classics: they don\u2019t have enduring themes. They speak to an audience which doesn\u2019t like to take the time to think about things and that will be it\u2019s ultimate down fall. To write classic books we need to read the ones we already have and study them, because they\u2019ve proven their worth over time.

And seeing him just put me in a foul mood.  That's not a good sign.  So that was that, we didn't really talk, I just told him to call me when he gets home from work.  But we all know by now that won't happen.  I just want this to be done.  But we won't get into it right now.  I called my mom today and I could barely talk to her.  I was almost in tears, just about everything.  I have my days, but today was bad.  I didn't think I was going to be able to stop crying.  I just wasn't feeling strong today, I told my mom I wanted to come home.  I shouldn't have said that.  She just told me to keep my chin up.  Then she told me a story about my 4 year old niece and I was cracking up.  That's the stuff I miss.    Funny story.  Last night Shelly and I went to get some movies, and I wanted popcorn, but when I got home I realized it was Kettle corn, and I just wasn't in the mood for that.  I wanted something really buttery, so I made her take me back to the store.  We were outside looking at Christmas trees, and I totally tripped over some cement slap and twisted my knee.  How stupid is that?  Yeah I hurt myself looking at trees.    I ate so much sugar last night.  I don't know what it was.  I just wanted sugar.  But anyway, we watched movies last night.  Well I actually watched about 4 movies, because I am an insomniac.  Pirates of the Caribbean.  Good movie.  At first I was a little weirded out about Johnny Depp, but then I was pleasantly surprised.  He was really good in this movie.  Then we watched Old School, and then I watched Serendipity, and then I watched Pulp Fiction, but I fell asleep through that.    So one thing I love about California, is all the bathrooms have toilet seat covers.  I love that.  In Illinois you were lucky to find a bathroom with those things.  Public bathrooms are just so disgusting.  I hate them.  We were in Wal-Mart today and I had to pee, so I went in, and I just cringed.  But I opened one of the stalls and there is the toilet seat cover dispenser!  Thank you soooo much!    Ok, I gotta go, I am rambling on about nothing."], "gold_label": 0.0}

That way, if someone turns up wearing the same dress as you at least yours will be slightly different, if not better.  Don't put on bright make up!!! Keep it simple and beautiful.  Earrings which dangle usually add to the elegance. According to  urlLink this  American prom site we should do the following:  4 Months Before Prom...  Make a checklist.  Find out how much money your parents will contribute.  Start saving money if necessary.  Pick out that special dress (put it on lay-away if necessary).   3 Months Before Prom...  Begin to maintain your hair and nails.  Pick out your accessories to coordinate with your dress.   6 Weeks Before Prom...  Purchase your Prom tickets.  Make an appointment to have your hair, nails, and makeup done.  If you are doing your own hair, start trying out different styles.  If you have not been asked for a date yet, check to see if the one you would like to go with has asked anyone, or ask a close friend before its too late. You can also go with a group of friends and have just as much fun and sometimes more.  Discuss your plans for Prom with your parents.   4 Weeks Before Prom...  Start wearing your Prom shoes around the house to break them in.  Pick up your Prom dress.  If you havent already done so, introduce your Prom date to your parents.   2 Weeks Before Prom...  Confirm all reservations and appointments you have made for the day and night of Prom.  Take care of last minute details: pantyhose, film, etc.   Prom Day  Pick up your dates boutonniere.  Go to your hair, nails, and makeup appointment(s).  Put some extra cash in your purse.\n\nText 2:Why do your best friend's mums always need you to fix their computers?

ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Deborah Verstegen.  From the ERIC Digest:  Early efforts to achieve greater efficiency in schooling focused on educating the largest number of students at the lowest possible cost. Research about schools, following industrial models, stressed the phenomenon of 'economies of scale.' If industry could boom as a result of such economies, why could not education benefit in similar ways? Subsequently, aggressive state policy initiatives sought to capture similar benefits for education through consolidating schools and districts.   Today, by contrast, more attention is being given to what education dollars produce in terms of morale, student achievement, curriculum, and positive attitudes towards learning. This change in outlook is driven by a growing body of research that focuses on the outcomes that dollars buy (e.g., Fox, 1981; Goodlad, 1984; Hawkins, 1985; Monk, 1990; Plecki, 1991; Turner, Camilli, Kroc, & Hoover, 1986). In particular, recent studies suggest that small schools and districts may be a more efficient investment than large schools, because the learning value per unit of expenditure seems to be higher there (Plecki, 1991; Walberg & Fowler, 1987).   The new findings represent a dilemma for lawmakers, educators, and communities. This issue especially concerns rural areas, since schools and districts there tend to be smaller than their urban or suburban counterparts. This Digest examines state strategies for meeting the unique financing needs of rural, small schools and districts. To what extent do states actually provide additional support for rural and small schools? On what basis is this support distributed?\n\nText 2:Well here's the report of my latest big trip all the way up the Highlands Highway to Mt. Hagen, defacto capital of the Highlands, and the one that I have had the most experiences on.\u00a0 So I thought I would share those and a few observations as well.  The purpose of the trip was the same as the others, to deliver computers to our study centre in Hagen.\u00a0 I was heading up there with the boss, George,\u00a0this time, instead of like the previous trips where I went with one of the office workers.\u00a0 There was a couple of reasons for this:\u00a0it is a long trip so\u00a0it is good to have a couple of people who can drive the vehicle, George is also a Hagen man with a house and family there, so he obviously knows the area extremely well, and as he hadn't been home for a while, he decided to give himself a free trip there, with the added bonus of getting a 'living away from home allowance'.   So we agreed to a plan to leave Lae at 8 on Saturday morning to get a good run and so we didn't arrive too late.\u00a0 I got to the office a little before 8 so we could load the Ute with the PC's.\u00a0 The boss wasn't there so I surfed the internet to check my e-mail, send e-mail, surf some more, make a call to see where he was - no answer - more surfing, pace up and down, and finally see him two hours late.\u00a0 There should be a course or book you can do/read: 'How to be diplomatic, when you have been put out by your superior'.\u00a0 Well the way I handled it was not to mention it.\u00a0 It seemed to work and from a few drops bit of information he passed on, I gleaned that he had been at the Aviat club last night.\u00a0 I had been out too - at the staff club, sinking beers - but it didn't stop me from getting there on time.  On the road things settled into the usual long driving trip.\u00a0 We exhausted the solitary cassette that George had stashed in the glove compartment for such occasions, which contains such classics as Rod Stewarts - 'Have I told you lately' song - twice.\u00a0 The 'He ain't heavy he's my brother' song and etc.\u00a0 Luckily I brought along, as per\u00a0the other trips, my saviour, the iPod with 8000 songs, with enough variety to please anyone.\u00a0 It was not long before George was like a kid in a lolly shop going through the collection and finding artists like Creedance Clearwater Revival, The Eagles and ABBA.\u00a0 Thankfully he could not find Kenny Rogers, which thankfully I don't have - you have to set some standards.\u00a0 I also steered him into finding some Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and Dire Straits.\u00a0 So the trip became somewhat of a blast from the past, into the 70's and early 80's.  It was agreed that I would drive to Kianantu (the infamous nothing town from the last e-mail), and then George would take the reins,\u00a0but when we got there we decided I would go all the way to Goroka.\u00a0 After Kianantu, G started to tell me about how notorious the area was between there and Goroka for hold ups.\u00a0 Masked men jump out in front of buses,\u00a0waving guns and rob the passengers of their hard earned money made at markets.\u00a0 The good old fashion style highwayman, but certainly no Robin Hood's - steal from the poor and keep.\u00a0 G kept telling me that one of the worse areas was at a top of a hill that takes quite a while to climb up.\u00a0 The raskols (pidgin for troublemaker/vandal/thief/anyone who's bad basically) see the vehicles on the roads below and get ready to hi-jack them.  As I approached the top of the hill I saw two Toyota hi-ace 15 seater buses pulled over on the other side of the road.\u00a0 I also see some men milling about outside of them.\u00a0 I see one at the back of them with a scarf wrapped around his face.\u00a0 I recognise that he is pointing a gun at our car.\u00a0 I hear George yell 'Go, go, go, don't stop'.\u00a0 I duck down and plant my foot down on the accelerator wanting it to go faster after the climb up the hill, which with a load of computers it was not too happy about.\u00a0 I need to change gears to gain that extra power, but ducking makes this tough to do.\u00a0 I start to think whether my door would stop a bullet - probably not.\u00a0 And I hear one of the bandits outside through my open window shouting something.  We make it over the hill and around a few corners untouched, gaining speed on the decline.\u00a0\u00a0 It all happened quickly.\u00a0 The first thing George says is 'You should have taken a photo of that'.\u00a0 He knows that I like photography, but 'What The ...?'.\u00a0 Hang on I think.\u00a0 Driving a car while ducking down.\u00a0 Trying to change gears.\u00a0 Worrying about getting shot.\u00a0 Yeah I could of taken out my camera from my bag behind the seat, and shot the bandits through a lens instead.\u00a0 No worries.  A safe distance away we pull over and flag down an on coming truck to warn them.\u00a0 Then we proceeded and stop a Hi-ace and then after that, the real prize that the raskols would be after, two 25 seater Toyota Coaster buses, coming all the way from Mt. Hagen.\u00a0\u00a0 All the drivers (and passengers hanging out the windows too) were thankful for the tip off.\u00a0 After all this drama, we kept on going to Goroka, and George then proceeded to tell me about other incidents that he had been involved in the past, with one time his car actually being shot at and smashing a window.\u00a0 He also said that the raskol I could hear yelling was actually telling us to keep going, they weren't interested in our red Ute it seems anyway, though a gun being pointed your way makes you think otherwise in the heat of the moment.  At Goroka we changed seats after getting some food at a Super-Market and a couple of beers at the Bird of Paradise Hotel (aka the Bird - nice place if you ever go there).\u00a0 From now on I would be heading into new territory.\u00a0 It was also getting late.\u00a0 We left Goroka at 2:30 and it was still a 4-hour drive to Hagen.  The rest of the trip was incident free, but I got some new perspectives on what the Highlands is really like.\u00a0 From the top of the Daulo pass (2478m - higher than Mt Kosciuszko, highest mtn in Oz) you get a fantastic view back over the valley that Goroka lies in.\u00a0 From then on you pass from the Eastern Highlands province into the Simbu province.\u00a0 Once this happens the road get noticeably worse.\u00a0 Obviously they don't spend the same sort of cash on maintenance as they do in EHP.  I also got to see that other danger that is driving in the highlands, something that I had not really encounted on my stay here so far.\u00a0 Pigs.\u00a0 Every little roadside village that you pass through seemed to have them wandering all over the road.\u00a0 Now some people I talked to before leaving Australia already know this, but I will say it again, If you hit a pig and kill it with your car it is only a close second behind hitting and killing a person.\u00a0 Therefore I was glad that George had taken over as I am sure that he could handle the situation better if we unlucky enough to enrage the locals by wrapping one of their prized swine around our wheel.  At this point I might as well mention what the roads are like in PNG, so some people don't get the wrong impression.\u00a0 To start with the Highlands Highway, is more like a country road in Australia, two lanes, one going, one coming.\u00a0 There are certainly no dual carriageway's joining the towns together.\u00a0 Then because of the terrain, especially in the Highlands, the roads meander a lot and there are a lot of corners, making it a good challenge to drive.\u00a0 If you are a motorcyclist you would probably love it.\u00a0 Thirdly, people build their huts and villages right on the roadside, and if they are not doing anything, they will probably just hang around sitting on the side of the road and get up when a car approaches.\u00a0 And finally villagers will use the road as a walking track, so you are constantly giving a toot of the horn in case they don't hear you approach.  We passed through Kunidawa and the road became even worse, and then eventually we passed into the Western Highlands province, and roads were not much better.\u00a0 So by the time we got to Hagen it was 7:30, all up an 8\u00bd-hour trip, not including stops.\u00a0 The proposed plan to stay at Georges village quickly went out the window as it was another 40 minutes past Hagen, so instead we stopped in at the motel I was checked into for the night after and checked in for this night instead.\u00a0 Then we went around and I met all of George's family and Leo the principal of the secondary school where I would be setting up the computers.  The next day, Sunday, I collected George and we headed out to pay a visit to his dad, who lives about an hour away in a village off the road to the Southern Highlands.\u00a0 When we got there the entire village came out to greet us.\u00a0 I was immediately the subject of much curiosity, and this included the usual hand shaking of every one there.\u00a0 All the pikinini's (kids) came up and were very interested in me, I was probably the first white person most of them had seen.\u00a0 There is certainly no TV in these types of villages.\u00a0 George's dad was a little fellow who came up chest high on me, but it didn't stop him from nearly pulling me over when he gave me a bear hug.  In the afternoon I had a new New Guinea experience to attend - a compensation ceremony.\u00a0 Leo the principal I met the night before, had been doing some extra-marital affairs, which had come to attention of the wrong people.\u00a0 Basically he had befriended a divorcee, but the family of the ex-husband claimed that he owed them, because the ex-wife was still their's.\u00a0 In PNG women basically still get bought and sold by family's as wives.\u00a0 In fact women are basically treated as second-class citizens, and certainly not commensurable to men.  The beef that Leo had had resulted in this compensation ceremony that I now had got to attend, which is unique to the Highlands.\u00a0 Leo had basically admitted to being wrong and therefore the whole process would go quickly.\u00a0 A spot was picked, the two families came together, plus all the other hanger on's - like me.\u00a0 So there was in total over a hundred people.\u00a0 Everyone sat in a circle, and then Leo's dad started the proceedings.\u00a0 He talked in Melpin, their tok ples (local language), which sounded a lot like an Aboriginal language, and explained why they had all come together and why Leo has accepted to pay up.\u00a0 Then they bought out the pigs, four of them and they were tied to stakes, and then Leo came forward and pulled wads of cash from his pockets, put it together, held it up and proclaimed this was 6000 Kina.\u00a0 Even I realised that this was a lot of money for them.\u00a0 The cash was handed over to the other family who accepted it.\u00a0 Then the father of the ex-husband went on in a big speech for about 15 minutes, which sounded like he was talking about everything from the matter at hand to national politics.\u00a0 Then someone else got up, had his view on the matter, then another person, then another, another and another.\u00a0 Every bloke there seemed to have his own view.  Eventually the whole thing ground to a halt and everyone seemed happy, especially the other family who started to distribute money, to anyone they considered important enough to get a piece of the pie.\u00a0 It seems I had got off lucky, and only had to witness a 1\u00bd-hour process, mainly because it had been all agreed beforehand.\u00a0 George told me that when there is no agreement beforehand, the compensation can start at 10 in the morning and last until 5 in the afternoon.  On Monday I went and delivered the computers to the School (Leo was not there) but found out I could not set them up because the room was not ready.\u00a0 So we just stacked them in a storage room and agreed that I would come back at some point, probably by air to set them up.\u00a0 Beats me why these study centre coordinators tell us one thing and then when I get there find out another. \u00a0Both me and George were not particularly happy with this. \u00a0It was the same when I went to Madang.\u00a0 Ohh well.  In the afternoon, George and me took a trip out to his village, so he could show me around.\u00a0 He has a house there and it was quite a good little cabin.\u00a0 Inside it was very commodious, furnished with soft lounges and chairs and even a fireplace included, something that can be needed in the highlands.\u00a0 I was eying the place off as a potential retreat; unfortunately the place is too far away from Lae to be readily accessible.\u00a0 Two creeks run past either side, burbling over rocks that can be heard from the house, which creates, not unlike rain on the iron roof, a very pleasant effect.\u00a0 It was a pity that I didn't get to stay there on this trip as G had business to attend to in town this night.\u00a0 So it was back off to the motel for me.  This time we left early on for the trip back, and this time I got to see what the landscape was like on the approach to Hagen, something that I missed out on the way due to it being dark.\u00a0 There were coffee and tea plantations doting all over the countryside of the Waji valley and glimpses of the highest mountain in this part of the world, Mt Wilhelm (4509m - and one that I will be climbing at the end of the month).\u00a0 I also figured out something that I had been wondering ever since I arrived here.\u00a0 Why aren't there any road signs anywhere?\u00a0 Then when I saw a village hut with a road sign above the door saying, 'Hump', I figured it out.\u00a0 Road signs make great house building material.\u00a0 Plus I thought the sign was appropriate, what else is there to do in a village?  We made it all the way to Goroka and then stopped there for a while.\u00a0 I got dropped off at our study centre to finish a couple of things that I needed to do from the week before, and then we went and had lunch at the Bird.\u00a0 I offered to take over the driving, but George wanted to, as the hold-up mountain still needed to be crossed, and this time George wanted to do it.  On the way there, we came across a police truck carrying about a dozen heavily armed cops with M-16 machine guns and shotguns in the back, heading the same way as us.\u00a0 We both thought it provident to stay behind these guys as they could certainly deal with anything on top of the mountain.\u00a0 To keep behind them, as they were quite a bit slower, we did things like pull over for a pit-stop (a bloke thing, if you know what I mean), and buy some bananas from a road side stall (50 toea - 20 cents - for 10 bananas, can't beat that).  Eventually we made it to the bottom of the mountain, with the police truck slowly going up.\u00a0 So we followed.\u00a0 Then the truck stopped, they flagged us to stop, and seven cops jumped down from the tray, ran to us and took cover off our back and jumped in.\u00a0 It seems we were going to provide cover and disguise if needed at the top.\u00a0 It also seemed that the truck was deployed down the highway for the sole purpose of trying to get the raskols.  Our now pernicious red Ute slowly took off, overtaking the stationary police truck.\u00a0 I did a rough count of the weaponry we had, 5 M-16's, 2 Shotguns and a pistol.\u00a0 I got my camera out, this time I would be prepared.\u00a0 I reclined my seat so that I was more hidden, but still could see.\u00a0 I became nervous because I now knew how cops dealt with raskols especially ones that carry guns.  There is no 'stop or I will shoot' in PNG.\u00a0 If you have a gun and obviously have the intent to use it, police don't attempt to safely wound you in the arm or whatever.\u00a0 You will get pumped full of lead, as simple as that.\u00a0 George told me a tale how ten years ago in this very spot, there were similar hold-ups happening.\u00a0 Armed police were deployed into buses that were becoming the victims.\u00a0 A few times buses went safely through without incident, but one particular time 16 unlucky raskols decided to hold-up a bus carrying the cops.\u00a0 Seven raskols were killed, four were wounded and the rest managed to get away.\u00a0 That's why I was nervous, would I become a witness to a massacre, or worse would I be in the crossfire.\u00a0 The upside of the events ten years before was that the raskols were shown a lesson and there were no incidents for about six years.  As we approached the top, we came across a number of vehicles parked on the side of the road - the same spot we flagged down the truck on the way to Hagen.\u00a0 There were a couple of buses, it seems they had been informed of raskol activity that had been happening not so long ago.\u00a0 Great I thought.\u00a0 The stopped drivers saw the cops on the back of our Ute and changed their initial signal for us to stop to a wave us through.\u00a0 Great again.  We timidly approached the top (well me at least), and saw there was no one about.\u00a0 No held-up buses and no raskols.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 The cops banged on the roof jumped off and ran around to see if they could spot anyone.\u00a0 One of them sighted someone fleeing across another hill, and fired off a burst of his M-16.\u00a0 If they weren't running they were now.\u00a0 We said goodbye to the cops and continued, with me at least thankful there was no incident.\u00a0 The only regret that I now have is that I did not get a photo of seven cops sitting in the back of our Ute, brandishing their arsenal.  At Kianantu I took over the driving, and we made it down to Lae 3-hours later, untouched.\u00a0 After a total of 10 hours of travel, I walked back into my home.\u00a0 It felt good to be home.  Looking back I can certainly say that it had been a trip that I will remember for a while.\u00a0 Though I am now looking forward to the next one with all the vagaries that come in PNG."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Mike and Amanda leave on Sunday. I'm elated. I wish I were going with them now, but it's a small matter. I'll be there soon enough. Billy and I are going to try and make the trip as quick as possible. Not with excessive speeding, but without excessive stops. I'm hoping we can make it in three long days. It's been done. Actually, I've done it.  I doubt there will be many more posts from Mike and Amanda for a couple days. They're running around frantically (and I mean that literally) trying to finish all the things on their chalkboard list. Among them were getting an oil change and getting rid of Mike's car. I called him this morning to tell him I got a mowhawk today and he told me he sold the car for $25 to a dealer in Hamburg. I thought it was worth at least $27.  So, to my best friends, I will say simply: May the wind always be upon your back, the sun always upon your face... and may you not spend all of my $1,000 for first, last, and security deposit.   Godspeed Mike & Amanda. Enjoy each other.   p.s. If you were reading closely, you might have noticed I said 'mowhawk'. Don't think I was kidding."], "gold_label": 0.0}

These are desperate times and I'll stop at nothing to have represenation for my craft.  What I'm saying is that I'm a whore.  Yours in Christ,  DJS\n\nText 2:It  Is  Discrimination (with a stunning surprise ending)  By Duf Fer  I have been meaning to respond to your post from a few days ago, Panda, and have not found time to type my thoughts (what with the Jackie Brown imbroglio and all).  Anyway, I wanted to say that it  is  discrimination in the workplace when you treat someone differently because of their marital/parental status.  I was talking to Hal about it, and these are my thoughts:  Being married (in and of itself) should not make a difference in how people are treated at work.  However, I feel I am treated differently (better) at work because I am married.  I think people take married folks more seriously, and I think our society tends to root for families (read married people).    People with kids are torn.  You usually have to leave by a set time (I get away with it because Mrs. Duf is extraordinarily supportive and has a job where she is done every day at the same time) and be with your youngins.  Heres whats different.  Everyone knows you have a child, and everyone knows it means that sometimes you will not be able to stay late or take that trip.  I should note that there is an expectation that fathers will have work as a slightly higher priority than home and will still go the extra mile.  The bread-winner expectation is still there.  I feel it a lot a work (a lot of folks I work with are childless  we have an amazingly, disproportionately high number of DINKs here).  When I take a half day because my daughter is sick, I don't expect anyone to take up my slack, but I do feel that some folks wonder why Mrs. Duf isn't doing it instead of me.  Single people without kids have a tougher time because people at work tend to assume that they have nothing else to do except burn the midnight oil.  That is a yucky assumption.   When I read your piece Panda, I was thinking about my situation at work.  There are two people who have my job title.  Me (married for 3 years with 1 child) and my counterpart (married for 25 years, 2 kids are grown and out of the house).  The easy assumption is that my counterpart can come in whenever she wants and leave whenever she wants.  I stroll in around nine (hey, Hal set the standard) and people know it is because I have to get my daughter up and dressed and to daycare (much more time consuming than you would think  I wake everyday at 6:00 and I cant get to work until 9:00 when all is said and done).  But her life is still full of obligations.  She moved to a new house, she broke her foot, and she has a sister up north in the middle of an awesome battle against cancer.  My whole point:  we need to move to place where we dont consider marital status (or parental status) in the workplace.  We should not assume that because someone is single and childless that work is the only thing that have to do.     Surprise ending:  Panda and I are in AGREEMENT!"], "gold_label": 1.0}

I certainly feel sorry for his family, friends, and loved ones; for Elliot Smith who must have been so fractured as to have done such a terrible and painful thing to himself; and for his artistic voice which I held in great esteem.  While I never saw him perform live, I was always in awe of his ability to write an engaging narrative and wonderful Beatles/Brian Wilson melodies. His solo albums started off with sparse arrangements - voice and guitar - but gradually he added in instruments until he was recording/playing with full bands, which is where his Beatles fascination came into full view.    While I was also engaged by his recordings, I think I will always remember him for the way his songs touched that part of your persona that emerges only on the really bad days when the world has got your back against the wall.  Some people described his music as depressing, however I would argue that it spoke lessons of defiance  that no matter how bad the thing holding you down is, you are better and smarter than it and eventually you will beat it.

First day is tomorrow.  :/\n\nText 2:So I wake up this morning when my brother leaves for work at 8:30 cuz I told him to wake me up.  But then I didn't feel like getting up so I went back to sleep.  I woke back up at around 9:30 and was just laying there.  Phone rings.  Tis Olivia. 'Get your lazy butt down here!' 'Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming...' 'You just woke up!' 'Hey, for your information, I woke up FIVE MINUTES ago.' Our conversation lasts a couple minutes more, and I tell her I will leave in 15 minutes.  But I leave in like 30, because it is of course not humanly possible to take a shower, get dressed, and dry as much hair as I have in 15 minutes. So i get ready and go to watch the tennis tryouts.  I do not know for why I do this, as it will just make me wish I was not leaving in August even more.  But nonetheless, I went.  And it was fun.  Allyn, Shawna, John, Kevinh, David, Melissa, Braittany, Nick, Nick, Taaha, Shaby....I am going to miss them all so much.  Kevinh is prolly the funniest guy I know.  He cracks me up sooo much.  Sigh.  Oh well.  I took Brittany home, and we decided to go to the movies sometime this week, if we can work it out with our work schedules.  Then I came home and went to eat lunch with Ashley (not drill team Ashley).  We got some chinese from Mr. Wok's.  But then she had to go to work.  So I came home and desperately searched for someone to go shopping with me.  Because I told myself yesterday...I said to myself, 'Self, you are going to go get some school shopping done tomorrow whether or not you have anyone else to go with.' But yeah that was a stupid idea.    A note about jeans:   THEY NEVER FIT like they are supposed to.  At Khols I try on these 13s that are wayyyyy too big for me so i am like ok, maybe i lost some weight, so i go down to the 11s...exact same brand and everything....one pair is bigger than the 13s I tried on and one pair is wayyy too small.  i am like, what the crap is this crap.  So I left Khols with just buying some shorts for 6 dollars.  Lessee then I went to the mall and that was pretty boring.  I looked around in a few stores that didn't have anything cheaper than $30.  My resolution this year is to not spend over $20 on a pair of jeans.  The clearance rack at American Eagle had cheap jeans.  Originally 50, marked down to 40, plus 50% off of the marked down price.  Most of them were stretch though, and I hate stretch, so I only ended up getting one pair.  They fit quite nicely.  Then I went to a couple of other stores and THEN heh...I went into The Buckle.  I had never been in there before because every time I was with someone, they'd just be like, 'Oh, they are really expensive.' and so we never went in there.  Well, I walk in there and this guy that works there comes up to me and is like, 'Hi!  How are you doing today?' and I am just like, 'Fine.'  This guy is super attractive, btw.  Way out of my league.  And then he was like, 'Looking for anything special?' and I was like, 'Nope, just looking around.' and he was like, 'Have you ever bought jeans here before?' and I was like, 'No.' and so he was like, 'Ok, I'll tell you a bit about our jeans.  We have Lucky brand.  (he looks at me) and these are generally around $80.  And we have CKY (I guess thats how you spell it) (he looks at me again).  And those are anywhere from $50-$60.'  I was thinking:  bastard!  What, do I look like I can't afford your crappy ass jeans?  You think your store is just 'too expensive' for me???  Well, screw you.   So, instead of raising my eyebrows in shock and saying something like, 'Heh, I dun think so.' I just nodded and looked like I was interested in buying something.  Heh.  What a big mistake.  So I was like, 'I'll just look around.' and make my way to the wall o jeans.  He follows.  'So, what size do you wear?'  I am just like, 'Eh, like an 11.'  Their jeans aren't sized like that, they actually have measurements so he found some that matched up and gave me like three pairs.  All the time asking me questions like, 'Do you like a big flare, a small flare, or maybe a boot cut?'  To which I would reply, 'Uhh...a regular flare?'  Then he pointed the way to the dressing room.  However, before I got in there, he was like, 'Now, the only condition is that when you try on a pair, you have to come out and let me see how they look on you.'  I was like, ahhh!  Is he hitting on me or am I imagining this??  So I was just like, 'Uhhh....let you see?' and he was all, 'Don't be shy.'  Ok, so I was thinkin, heck I am not going to parade around in front of this guy so he can tell me if he likes the jeans on me...except that the only freakin mirror was outside the supid dressing room!  So, I go in there and within seconds he has three more pairs of jeans thrown over the door and he is talking to me through the door.  I am so uncomfortable.  I mean, talking to a guy while you are half-naked and changing is just....weird.  So yeah, he ends up giving me like 7 more pairs before my visit is over.  Anyway, I come out the first time and he is like, 'Oh those look good, but are they too long?' and calls another of the workers over there and so they are both looking at my legs...jeans...whatever...and are like, 'Well, what are the measurements?  We can go one smaller.'  So the other guy is like 'Well, turn around, the measurements are on the back of the jeans.' and I am like are you kidding me!!!!  Luckily, I found the measurements on the front part of my jeans and read them to him.  hahahahaha.  I only tried on like two more pairs because I felt really bad that I was wasting all their time because there was no way I was ever going to buy their overpriced jeans.  He even got me a bunch of shirts to try on with the jeans!! I mean, seriously, it reminded me of shopping with my mom when I was a little kid and she would put more and more clothes over the door of my dressing room and be like, 'Oh these would be cute on you!!'  Right, so anyways, I finally left and brought the seven pairs out of the dressing room and was like, 'Umm...I think I will come back...Saturday....when I have more cash....' and he was all, 'Oh well for only 20 dollars you can put two pairs of jeans on layaway and pay for them over an extended period of blah blah blah blah...' and I was like, 'Well, the thing is...I am not sure that $50 is worth one pair of jeans.  (Major embarrassment for me right here, because he is just realizing that he wasted his selling skills on me).  He turned around to go do something, and I slipped out of the store before the situation became any more awkward.  I am not going back Saturday.  I hope to never return actually.  :)  Even if the guy was really good-looking.  Then I came home and my brother came in my room to use the phone.  If anyone ever wonders where I get my nerdness from, talk to him for like five minutes.  Phone convo. (Note: This Ryan is not the Ryan that I like)  'Hello, is Ryan there?' (long pause) 'Hey, Ryan, this is Matt.  You wanna go to Best Buy with me?' (long pause) 'For fun.  You know, just to hang out.' LOL....ahhh  second instance of nerdness. ::In car.

She works at one of our branches in Ohio, but was visiting her sister for a few days and wanted to make a few things. She printed a couple posters for her sister and wanted to place an order for a large oversized color poster for her parents' 27th anniversary.  Normally we don't do them while you wait, but since she was a fellow employee, my boss decided just to go ahead and print it. We didn't have any other jobs to work on anyway. It turned into a fiasco pretty quickly though, since the file wouldn't send to the printer for some reason. 3 hours and 4 computers later, we finally had a decent print. During which time, we all gave our stories about the worst customers. Suprisingly enough, people in Ohio are apparently just as crazy as Californians.  I told Laura I would visit her store when I fly home in a few weeks. I don't know if I'll actually be able to, but it's a nice thought. It was pleasant to have extra company for a few very dead hours.  After I left this morning, I decided it was finally time to go down to the DMV and get my driver's license. So I left work around 6:30, drove home to pick up my checkbook and change into some jeans, then drove to the Office in Burbank. I found it by accident a few weeks ago, while looking for a car wash. The other thing I haven't done since I got here.  The first time I saw it, there was a line out the door and around the corner. My strategy became an early attack. If the office opens at 8AM, I could definitely get there by 7 and beat the rush. Wishful thinking. I got there at 7 on the dot and there was already a line with 10 people.   It didn't seem that bad though. I've been to the Michigan DMV and sat for 3 hours before, just waiting to talk to someone. How long could 10 people possibly take? I'd printed the driver's manual at work, and sat against the wall to study for the test. All the rules seemed pretty much the same as Michigan - sans painted curbs. We don't have those. The rest seemed standard.  Finally, about 15 minutes to open, a guy with a pulley cart came outside and started asking people why they were there. He handed out forms from person to person, until another employee joined up. Finally, a woman asked me what I needed.  'How can we help you today?' she asked.  'Hi. I need to get my license,' I said, smiling as much as possible.  Without even a grin - 'First time in California?' 'Yes. First time.'  She stared at me for a second with her mouth open and asked if I had a passport or a birth certificate. I'd read nowhere on the website or in the manual that either was necessary, so I asked if my old driver's license was ok, and reached for my wallet. She just looked away for a second, mouth still hanging open, completely devoid of any brightness and repeated 'Birth certificate or passport.'  I suddenly realized the end of my long night was the beginning of her longer day. She also didn't seem to want to spend much more time discussing the subject, so she handed me a form and turned to the next person. The top read: 'Driver License OR Identification Card Application.'  I saw a passport application recently, and I remember it being less detailed than the 8 sections of text in front of my eyes. I suddenly felt like I was applying for citizenship to a foreign country. I guess it was silly to assume all I would need was an out of state license. Maybe they have problems here with immigration.   Getting a birth certificate will be fun, considering documents mailed to my address don't make it half the time. I have a feeling the landlord might have a deal worked out with the postman. I hate not being on the lease here. I have a worse feeling that a photocopy of my birth certificate won't suffice...  sigh   Defeated - against what seemed like ideal planning, I walked back to my car and drove past the entire line of people waiting - feeling slightly humiliated. I'd stood at the corner for an hour, so I'm sure a couple of them felt my dissapointment. I'm sure more than one person was there for the second time. Like the guy with a folding golf chair and cappucino or the teen with a CD player and science homework.  I have a feeling my next visit will be anything but speedy."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Did I miss it or something? Help someone . . .\n\nText 2:Liz Sucks but Doesnt Swallow  By Duf Fer   I have a dilemma:   A group of friends and I are planning to go to the Liz Phair show in Minneapolis on August 28th.  I bought a ticket at the oh so nice price of $15.  On my recent trip to Birmingham, I forgot to pack CD's, so I bought the new Liz Phair disc (and the new Annie Lennox disc) at the Atlanta airport (the prices were not so bad really).  Pause for a CD memory:   CD memory:   My preference is to buy only one CD at a time.  It gives me a chance to fully listen to the CD without the pressure of checking out two discs at once.  I almost never follow this rule, but I often try.  Every once in awhile, I will get two discs at once and they will both blow me away.  One example that comes to mind is that I bought Billy Bragg and Wilco's Mermaid Avenue and the Putamayo disc Memphis to Mali An African American Odyssey on the same trip - both are certified Duf' platinum.  Back to the dilemma:   The dilemma:   I hate the new Liz Phair CD.  Honestly, I have not had such a strong negative reaction to a disc since, well, ever.  It is absolutely horrible.  I like 'Extraordinary' well enough as a forgettable pop song (produced by The Matrix of Avril Levigne fame  why would an established artist like Liz Phair want to emulate Avril Levigne?), and Love/Hate conjures up the Liz of old, but the rest of the disc is borderline deplorable.  There are moments that are desperate like 'Favorite' and there are moments that are sick.  'H.W.C,' which stands for hot white cum 'give me your hot, white cum' is the easiest example (she plans to use it for healthy skin by the way).  Now, before you label Duf a prude, let me say that I have plenty of dirty discs.  No problem there.  In college, I had a copy of the Too Live Crew's uberdirty album Too Live is What We Are, and I dug it for a long time.  You said it yourself, you like it like I do ah memories.  Now I may seem like a sexist - how can I own a bunch of dirty discs and give Liz a hard time for being candid?  Well, its because I also own 'Exile in Guyville' and 'Whip Smart.' I even have 'whitechocolatespaceegg.' All three discs are quite candid and frank in sexual conversations, all are thick with smart music and some pop sensibility but mostly  all three discs are thick with clever lyrics .  Somehow, none of those discs are crass and vulgar.  I just don't believe that Liz feels this way.  I think she is adapting her style to sell records (and she has said as much).    The two things I like most in music are passion and honesty.  People ask me how I can love Vladimir Horowitz and Sonic Youth with equal devotion, it is because the one thing you cannot deny is that they are sincere and passionate.  They really feel what they are expressing.  It makes their art pure.  Its like going to a KoKo Taylor show.  You know that she is singing from her soul. She sings because she is a singer; she could not care less if singing made her a millionaire or the poorest woman in Chicago.  One the other hand, Liz Phair is trying to make some extra money by being dirty and applying formulas, and her impurity has corrupted the entire disc.  Its trash.  I will be at Cheapo before the sun sets.  Also, I'll take my ticket to the show and sell it to someone who would like to see her.  I ain't the one."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Well, okay, not strangers... acquaintances is more the appropriate term.   I'm a demonstrative person. I like hugging people, holding on to their arms, giving them a pat on the back. I only do this however to people close to me. So it really irritates me when people who I hardly consider close friends reach out and touch my tummy. I wanna say, 'Watch the hand! You're invading my personal space!'   Receiving a pat on the back from an acquaintance for a job well done is fine. But a pat on the tummy? All I do is freeze. Sometimes I inhale so they don't feel my love handles (LOL!). The truth is I get really annoyed. I mean, I don't do that to my pregnant friends. If I wanna feel their tummy, I ask for permission first.   I just had to let that out. Just because you're asking or concerned if your friend's pregnant, it doesn't give you the right to reach out and touch her tummy! Never forget the concept of personal space, man!

ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by McCombs, Kathryn and Moore, Dennis.  It reviews methods that educators can use to prevent disabled students from using illegal drugs.  From the ERIC Digest:   Youth with disabilities experience a substantially higher substance abuse risk than their nondisabled peers. In addition to the same risk factors for substance abuse, e.g., peer pressure, media enticements, and stress-as their counterparts in regular education, they also face many disability-specific factors for substance abuse, such as prescribed medications, chronic medical problems, social isolation, co-existing behavioral problems, and disenfranchisement. While educating youth with disabilities in inclusive settings exposes them to positive learning opportunities in the classroom, they also have more exposure to peer pressure for substance use, and at earlier ages. On the other hand, children in contained special education classrooms often have less socialization practice or skills, and may use substances in order to feel accepted by their peers. Compared with adolescents who have never been in classes for learning problems, a significantly greater proportion of students who have been in special education classes live in single-parent and nontraditional households, have a family member with an alcohol or other drug problem, have witnessed or experienced physical abuse, and report a history of sexual abuse and poor emotional health (Borowsky & Resnick, 1998). All of these contribute to identified risk factors for substance abuse, yet in a recent survey, more than half of special education teachers reported that they conduct prevention activities once a year or less; only 15% conducted such activities at least once a week (Morgan, Genaux, & Likins, 1994).\n\nText 2:urlLink Understanding and Preventing Teacher Burnout.

Archbishop Sean O'Malley announced the parish closings Tuesday, completing a process that began in December when he said the archdiocese would be forced to undergo a major downsizing.  He said the reduction was needed because of declining Mass attendance, a shortage of priests and the inability of the archdiocese to support struggling parishes -- many in older buildings in desperate need of repairs -- in the midst of a financial crisis caused in part by the abuse crisis.\n\nText 2:Note: I want to keep this at the top of my postings so that I can elicit as many comments/emails as possible. New postings may be below this one for that reason.    &nbsp;  I'm soliciting opinions, feelings, anger, whatever about the Eucharist that will be used in a book that will be entitled something like 'How to Get the Most Out of the Eucharist.' I want to make it 'real' so I'm putting it together from the ground up with all the feedback that I hear when I speak about the Mass to a wide variety of groups.  &nbsp;  So I think their are three problem areas, but I'm open to expanding the list based on the feedback that I get here:  &nbsp;     Feelings and Reality :  'I'm bored' 'I don't like the pastor (or fill in the blank)' 'I don't understand what's going on' 'The preaching (or again fill in the blank) sucks' 'I'm not being fed' 'I don't believe in it' 'I'm angry with the way things are done either correctly or incorrectly'    The Wandering Mind : ' I'm thinking about something else most of the time' 'I find it impossible to concentrate'    &nbsp;Real Abuses :  'We use words that aren't in the Missal' 'We shake hands at the beginning and in the middle' '(fill in the blank) 'We hold hands during the Our Father' 'The role of the priest and the laity is confused by the way the Eucharist is celebrated in our parish'    I would like to say with regard to #3 that sometimes people perceive and abuse where no real abuse is taking place, in defense of priests they sometime inherit a situation where certian things have been taking place in a parish and it is hard to stem the tide. I also think that many of the 'abuses' have crept into the liturgy because of the items in #1 and attempts to make the liturgy more exciting or relevant, both huge mistakes.&nbsp;Such&nbsp;errors&nbsp;reveal that one doesn't understand the liturgy enough to know that it is the most amazing, exciting and relevant thing we will ever do in this earthly life!

I earn money from them.  Nuff boutta BS.  The truth is, college is so sick, I love to hate it (which is all pure irony considering I don't really hate it.  Uh, never mind).

His fuel pump fuel tank is leaking, and I need to have the brakes checked out as well.  I believe the power steering thingie is leaking as well.  This car is just sucking up my money on stupid shit.  At least it runs well, and the mechanic said I will have no problems with it mechanically.  Whew!!  I drove the LeBaron today to pick up pizza and it got hot, in 50 degree weather.  Oh how I love my LeBaron...   One more week until I finally have my last allergy tests, and I can get some relief from my sneezing, crunchy-nosed existance.  I so much hate that I worked in Steubenville for 2 months, then was totally dismissed for refusing to be lied to and walked on.  I called JR today as I saw my old job (3 days a week) is still in the paper.  I told him I'd like to come back because I liked the job.  He told me he 'didn't think that was a good idea' and that he had a few people in mind for the position.  I then told him I wish I had known what a jackass he is prior to my agreeing to do him a huge favor by working in Steubenville.  Then I told him to kiss my ass, and I hung up.  Not exactly mature, but I do feel better now.  I'm sure if he was asked about that conversation he'd simply lie as he does about everything else.  I repeat, jackass.   One of our neighbors are totally getting evicted.  I've never seen someone get evicted before, so I'm all excited.  I know, the dumbest things amuse me.  I did find it to be quite amusing when another of our neighbors had both of their cars repo'd within 2 months of each other.  Teehee!  Honestly, I don't live in the ghetto, it's a very nice place.  My neighbors are just morons who'd rather party and buy grills than pay their bills.   Speaking of paying bills, Keith actually paid back that $50 ON TIME!!  I know, I almost crapped myself too.   I need to photograph my new shoes.  I have around 3 new pairs and both pairs of flip flops rock out.     Wolfie needs to get off of his ass and buy that Firechicken convertible I found for him.  The Trans Am is calling my name, but I do not need 4 cars.  Seriously now, my insurance is high enough on two 4 cylinder cars (one turbo) and a 6 cylinder car.  Like I need a car with the LT-1 engine, and over 300 horsepower.  OK, so I DO need a car like that, but my wallet doesn't.  I'm showing restraint and this is a good thing.   Fluffy the cat is a pimp G.   The Stark County Lincoln Highway Cruise-In is Saturday.  MotherNature better cooperate with us this year!!!

So I've designed a new template (yet again, all my own work, no templates or anything) and am currently in the process of transferring the content from the old site to the new. I quite like the new site design, I can see myself sticking with this one.  Since meeting Lisa via myvideochat.net I've learnt a lot about new web standards (such as XHTML and CSS design) and while I've not yet picked them all up - I've grabbed some - and am running like hell with them. It's good to learn something new. Especially as it's making my job easier. (Thank you Lisa).\n\nText 2:Good evening, I been knocked down so many times, counted out 6, 7, 8, 9.

Tune in after 10pm to 105.8 FM. It is the 16th of January, which means we are half way through the month, which means it's nearly February!  At this present moment in this thing we call 'time' I am extreamly annoyed with myself, I really don't understand what is going on. Teachers keep telling me that I need some help, and then they decide that I need to work harder and that I don't really need any help, so I have no idea what to do, and it's rather annoying.  Jackie, tell all, I do, and look what happens. It is perfectly okay, we arn't exactly going to take the mick or anything, and so what if somebody sends an e-mail? I know people talk about me for different reasons (mainly bad things) but so long as I don't hear it, I don't mind. If I where you, I would get it all out of your system and really go for it. My problem is I never have anybody to talk to, there are so many things I want to say, but I really don't want to bore people with it, but I really want somebody just to listen. I am trying to convince myself of this as well, but here is a theory of mine; You are born, and then you die, and anything in the middle is a bonus. So I am going to live as long as possible, and if I muck it up, oh well, I am hardly going to be regretting it when I am dead because I won't be able to think.  Are we all in touch with the news? We are sending the biggest ship in our Navy to join the rest of the guys in the Gulf. The thing that is really annoying me, a question that Charles Kennedy raised, if the USA go to war, but the UN don't - will the UK? I personaly believe that if the UN say we should go to war, then we should 'join in' and go along with it, otherwise we are going to be the misserable Brits who don't do anything. However, if the UN say 'no' to war, and the USA go to war, we should definatly not go with them. Without UN backing, they are making an offensive move as Iraq haven't exactly attacked the USA.  But we don't need to talk about rubbish such as war? We need to be happy and smily, even if we are in tears. I need to dream, and I have just remembered, I haven't answered Nicki's question about honeymoons. For my location, like I said, I really want to be somewhere different and unique. Away from anything else, just completely me, my wife, and nothing else. Perhaps a deserted island? Something with beatuiful scenery, next to a beach, blue waters. For the perfect wife? I am not fussed about looks and colours, blue or brown eyes, dark or light hair, I don't mind, I have the same preferences as most people, big clear eyes that you can just stare into for hours on end. They have to have a good sense of humor, enough to make me laugh, however beable to be completly serious at other moments. She has to like active sports so we can go to interesting places walking and things. I really want to do some back-packing somewhere, like in India. Anyway, I could go on for ages...  Life is rather dull, January is always like this, nobody can really be bothered to do anything. Once we get into February and half-term, people will start to pick up again, and then it's home free 'till Easter, then that's it, pretty scary.

If so, yes - there was a long build-up; I remember following it.  What interests me is if (a) the world community is responsible for the protection and preservation of specific nation's antiquities, and if so, then (b) how far does this responsibility go?  To public pronouncements?  To sanctions?  To the nation's border?  To physical intervention?  It seems that if it is true that we should have physically prevented the looting of the museums (which would have required wounding and killing many civilians on the building steps), then we should have sent special forces in to stop the destruction in Afghanistan.  What troubles me in a greater sense is that in all the debate about this situation and its implications, many of us are inspired to draw definite lines of principle without thinking just where those lines stop and start.  For example:  If we invaded Iraq to liberate the oppressed, why aren't we planning for the next operation elsewhere in the world?  There are plenty of targets.  If we should not have invaded Iraq because it was about oil, then would anyone have ever been able to stop daily rape, torture, and terror within its borders?  I hear a lot of absolutes, but not a whole lot of thinking.  We seem to prefer a world in bright, contrasting colors, drawn in broad, clear strokes, rather than the contradictory mess it actually is.  We seem to fight for easy definitions rather than face up to the unruly reality.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world is not in the clutches of conservatives, or liberals, or lobbyists, or lawyers; if it is trapped and pinned not by these, but by something completely different.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world -- if humanity -- has finally been overrun by idealists.\n\nText 2:'This issue marks 15 full years of News of the Weird.

Before you put this off as me just being a fruitcake, think about this: I go to work on one day and come home on another.   That being said, today's Wednesday.  The general plan of the day for today is for me to get some tires put on my car.  After that, we're going to the bank and FINALLY (after about six years of procrastination) getting Scott's name put on the checking account.  Don't ask.  It's a long story.  I also have to make a few phone calls for house stuff.  Tomorrow we have to go to the lawyer's and sign off the paperwork.  The buyers were around last night and everything is still looking like it's a go.  I just want it all to be done, already.  I'm really looking forward to the whole house-building process.  It's so much fun, and this time it will be even better than the first time we did it.  Scott's excited too, and he's already planning furniture and stuff he wants to build.  We are both really psyched to get out of Wilmington.  Choosing a property of the several we have on our list will probably be the most difficult decision we have left.  Between the two of us, we have the whole house basically planned out.  I've always had a huge problem with nursing uniforms.  They aren't made to fit me and the fabrics are too thin.  Additionally, I don't like straight skirts, and the skirts themselves are never the right length.  For about the last year or so I've been trying to find someone to make me some dresses.  I even bought some patterns, but I haven't gotten around to actually making anything (not to mention my sewing skills are a shade over mediocre at best.. I can make a nice apron, but a dress won't be nearly as good).  Anyway, I finally found a very nice lady who is going to make me some uniform dresses.  I have to buy them one at a time because I'm budgeting myself rather strictly these days, but I am looking forward to getting a few.  I so prefer to wear dresses anyway, and patients/families really do respond better to a nurse who looks more traditional.  If you'd like to see her website, it's  urlLink here .  Yes.  Remember I said I couldn't be stereotyped?  The humidity's dropped by about 35% in the last 36 hours.  Yesterday we had typical 'day after a hurricane' weather, with a huge drop in the humidity, blue skies, and a beautiful breeze.  The Atlantic is heating up, though, so it isn't nearly over yet.  I have a feeling we may see more than just a nudge from a storm this year.   urlLink\n\nText 2:This picture is from a lecture that was given at the all-night kirtan last Wednesday.       urlLink      urlLink ');'> postCount(' ');"], "gold_label": 0.0}

The pre-Panther version of OSX works well enough, but not zippy, on my two G3s.  Reluctant to advance further without G4 hardware.  But thanks for the tip.  Rarely is any technology ready for prime time in the first weeks of release.\n\nText 2:'The space program is bullshit.' - Don't hold back, tell us how you really feel!  ;)  Seriously though, is it the whole space program or just this latest decision/pronouncement you don't like?  We have and continue to enjoy the after effects of the initial Apollo missions with the spin off technologies.  I don't see that we will have the same boost as we got in the 60's from this, but that is the great thing about technology - you don't know about something useful until someone invents it.  '...the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed...' - What exactly makes someone unemployed?  Is my wife unemployed?  She has no paying job but also does not want one right now.  Is she included in those statistics?  What about the artist/actor who does not have a job because they are busy trying to get a part or find a patron?  They could at least respond to any of the fast food restaurants that always have 'Now Hiring' signs out front.  Are they included?  9 out of roughly 250 is 4%, which I think is lower than the rates I had heard (~6%), so it makes my wonder even more as to exactly how they come up with the numbers.  It just proves the saying that there are three types of information - lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Note that I am not saying that we don't have too much unemployment.  I would love for there to be 0%, but short of the government hiring anyone without a job to do something, I don't think the government has the responsibility or even power to do anything about it.  '...our economy has continuously gone downhill ...' - The economic downturn/recession/depression/dip/or whatever the hell you want to call it began noticeably in March of 2000 when the stock market went through its 'correction' (I hate that term, but that's what they call it).  The NASDAQ went from 5000 to 2000 in something like 6 weeks and the NYSE had a similar drop, taking down many peoples retirement and college education savings with it.  A friend of mine stupidly was holding the money he had made from the sale of his house in NASDAQ and watched it get reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount.  Let's see, I believe that in March of 2000, Governor Bush was trying to secure the Republican nomination for the White House.  And let's see, yeah I can see where President Bush was directly responsible for allowing the terrorist attacks that lead to the deaths of ~3,300 people, shaking our country to it's core, and causing an already weak economy to weaken further.  But the really bad news for the argument is that the economy has grown for the last two quarters and the highest rates in 20 years.  '...Bush stole the presidency...' - Sigh.  Miriam, help me out here.  How many times have I addressed this one in the last 3 years?  20?  I know that Eva was not here for them, so I will state my response again.  There are laws in place in every state that govern the way public elections are to be held.  They were followed in Florida, but Al Gore wanted to change them so that the ballots would be counted again (making three times if I remember correctly).  Bush appealed to the State Supreme Court, which upheld the decision to go ahead and recount.  Bush then appealed to the US Supreme Court, who finally voted 5-4 to stop the recounts and declare a winner based on the votes counted.  The Democrats cried foul and this was partisan politics.  If it had truly been partisan, the vote would have been 7-2, as that is the breakdown of R vs. D appointees.  What that showed to me was that the court was deeply divided, but made a ruling and it was carried out without the violence that probably would have occurred in other countries.  The Democrats keep bringing up the 500,000 more votes that Gore received.  If our system of elections was based on straight count, then that would be a valid point.  But, since the US Constitution clearly spells out the Electoral College process, it does not matter.  What the Democrats should be doing is trying to shore up support in the states where they were close, transferring the popular vote to electoral votes and possibly a White House win (shudder).  As a side note, one or two of the Florida newspapers went back after the fact and counted the ballots.  There was a slight change in the numbers, but Bush still won the state by some ridiculously close margin (around 200 votes).  '...(1)poorly thought out, and (2)expensive, (3)publicity stunt.' - (1) I don't think it is poorly thought out.  All that he has done is to set a target.  Was Kennedy's proclamation poorly thought out in 1961?  (2) Yes it will be  (3)  Probably so.  But then again, anytime a President announces something, it can probably be considered a publicity stunt or at the very least politically motivated (see the recent immigration announcement)  'He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs. '  - Would you rather he keep funding them and come up with the money from, say, Medicare?  Will any of those people, say working on the Space Shuttle, be able to transfer to the new programs?  I would hope so.  I found out with some dismay this weekend that Sean O'Keefe (NASA administrator) announced that the next HST maintenance mission has been scrubbed.  The current gyros have a 50% chance of failing in the next year and 75% within the next two years.  Once they go, Hubble will not be usable.  Additionally, the mission was going to boost it into a higher orbit.  Without this, it sounds like Hubble will reenter the atmosphere sometime in the next 2-4 years.  The replacement telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2008-2011.   Congratulations on the upcoming wedding."], "gold_label": 1.0}

This is a good summary of the learning theories taught by Herberg and Maslow.  From the site:  Among various behavioral theories long generally believed and embraced by American business are those of Frederick Herzberg and Abraham Maslow. Herzberg, a psychologist, proposed a theory about job factors that motivate employees. Maslow, a behavioral scientist and contemporary of Herzberg's, developed a theory about the rank and satisfaction of various human needs and how people pursue these needs. These theories are widely cited in the business literature.    In the education profession, however, researchers in the '80s raised questions about the applicability of Maslow's and Herzberg's theories to elementary and secondary school teachers: Do educators, in fact, fit the profiles of the average business employee? That is, do teachers (1) respond to the same motivators that Herzberg associated with employees in profit-making businesses and (2) have the same needs patterns as those uncovered by Maslow in his studies of business employees?    This digest first provides brief outlines of the Herzberg and Maslow theories. It then summarizes a study by members of the Tennessee Career Ladder Program (TCLP). This study found evidence that the teachers in the program do not match the behavior of people employed in business. Specifically, the findings disagree with Herzberg in relation to the importance of money as a motivator and, with Maslow in regard to the position of esteem in a person's hierarchy of needs.\n\nText 2:urlLink A New Framework for Teaching in the Cognitive Domain. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Michael Molenda.  It reviews the idea of the cognitive domain in teaching.  From the ERIC Digest:  For the past half century a central concern of instructional technologists has been not so much the production and use of instructional materials but rather the design of instructional systems-lessons, courses, and programs. This shift of emphasis occurred with the advent of the programmed instruction movement in the late 1950s when educators and instructional media specialists came to understand that the 'magic' of teaching machines was not in the hardware but in the pedagogical design of the software. As media specialists morphed into instructional technologists and became immersed in programmed-instruction lesson design they found themselves in league with instructional theorists, grappling with the issue of how to structure a lesson for maximum learning impact.    At mid-twentieth century, the dominant framework for lesson design-the programmed instruction format-was derived from efforts to apply operant conditioning to human learning. Cognitive psychology soon offered an alternative view, represented by Robert Gagne's Events of Instruction, which became the dominant framework through the end of the twentieth century. More recent developments suggest that a new conceptual framework, offered by M. David Merrill, may provide an even more comprehensive synthesis of instructional research and theory than the previous ones."], "gold_label": 1.0}

A recap for those who haven't read about  urlLink Sessions@Exun  or more specifically  urlLink PHP . The idea of Sessions@Exun was conceived so that interested people may learn a specific skill in computers from people who have already learnt that skill and are experienced in it. This helps because reading big, fat books is tedious and sometimes if the book is technical, then confusing as well. Teachers are always better than books anyway.  More specifically  PHP  ( P HP:  H ypertext  P reprocessor) is an HTML-embedded scripting language, which means that it is used for serving dynamic content on web pages, just like ASP. The only difference (usage-wise) between ASP and PHP is that ASP is a Microsoft product and needs a Windows Server to run on while PHP is Open Source and can run on any OS. And since Linux is being more widely deployed these days, it makes more sense to learn PHP if you're doing Server-Side Scripting. I am told that PHP is tougher than ASP, but since I have no knowledge of PHP (I'm counting on this Session myself), I can't say anything about that.   About  Mukul : Many people have asked me who Mukul is, so let me introduce him. Mukul is an Exun alumnus, currently studying at Iowa State University (US). He is here in Delhi for his summer break and has found time to give us an introduction to PHP, which he says is his mother tongue.  Please comment away people.

Shortly after his first birthday, Wilson moved to the community of Augusta, Georgia where he spent the early years of his life. The family moved again in 1870 to Columbia, South Carolina.   During his years in Columbus, Wilson settled down to serious educational study and in 1873, left home to attend Davidson College. He eventually transfered to the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, where he graduated in 1879. Wilson went on to earn a Ph.D from Johns Hopkins University in 1885. That same year, Wilson married Ellen Axson of Savanah, Georgia. The couple eventually had three daughters, Margaret, Jessie, and Eleanor.

Pretty easy by any standards.  Heh, Max Payne is such a badass :p  Mona Sax is such a hotty.  But yeah, the game owns, go play it, it's worth it just for the story.    That's all I really did today, play games, practice driving and did some homework, really uneventful, no interesting stories.  Oh wait. there is one.  I went to Shopper's World today to get some print cartridges, some bins, some clothes and a replacement toque.  As you can see, the picture in the below post has me wearing my favourite toque, it's all black with a simple Nike checkmark in the front.  It was the best toque ever, but then I lost it one day, and I was saddened :/  So, today, I went out in hopes of replacing my beloved toque.  Unfortunately, THERE WAS NO TOQUE IN SIGHT.  Those communists stopped producing my favourite toque and even worst the retarded salesperson made a sly remark at me.  What a jackass.  Because of that, I will never shop at Foot Locker again.  Ever.  YOU JUST LOST A VALUBLE CUSTOMER FAGMOTRONS.  So.. let me explain, why they lost such a valuble customer, such as myself.  I walked into the store, with an intent of browsing for my toque, but before I could even make it past the front shoe racks, some stupid lady in a referee getup asked how I was doing, whereupon I replied, with just fine and asked her how she was doing.  This was a horrible mistake as I let her ask me, 'Do you need any help?' and me, not being able to lie, said 'Yes, I'm looking for a black Nike toque'  She took me to her 'toque' section, which was quite sad really, it had like two toques and like 50 million fagetly looking crossbreed toque caps.  You know what i'm talking about, those new hats that seem to be so hip, which are between a cap and a toque.  Yeah, those are gay up the wazoo, no one likes them, go back to Italia you genos.  Anyway, i explained how i loved my toque so much and that I lost it and am in the process of replacing it, when she replied 'Good one there, buddy' in a condenscending matter.  Yep, I got quite mad and quickly left the store, in one of those, 'I'm not coming back here ever' struts.    I owned foot locker good.  or it owned me...  MEH!  That's all I got, later.\n\nText 2:This has been passed around the internet for a while now, and if you're not cool and haven't seen it yet, click  urlLink here .  Hiliarious!"], "gold_label": 1.0}

It's the month I do all those unpleasant, embarrassing yearly exam things.  Yesterday morning was the mammogram.  Just how flat can they make these things go, for Pete's sake?!?!?!  But, ya know, it's just one of those things you really have to do.  So, I did it and I'm really, really, really glad it's over for another year.    My baby girl has been sick most of the week, too.  Poor kid only made it back to school on Thursday and then couldn't finish yesterday or today - she was just too exhausted from coughing and being achy.  But she was only 1/2 an hour from managing the entire school day both days.  We knew she'd had it, though, because usually she stays after school to play with pals while we mom's all chat.  She was very willing to give that up and just come home and lay down for a little while.  Mostly, it's a cold that has aggravated her asthma.  But I give her a rest of half an hour and she's ready to go again.  In fact, tonight, she and Daddy are off to a Girl scouts sponsored Father/Daughter dance.  They looked so nice and she was so excited.  I think Daddy's going to enjoy it, too.  And Mom gets a nice, quiet evening alone.  But I miss them the whole time they are gone, too.  And worry if they aren't home when I think they should be.  Neurotric, I know.  Wish I could just be more calm about it all.  I actually had a lot to say when I first signed on here tonight, but I've had a bunch of interruptions, so I think I'll just stop and try again tomorrow.\n\nText 2:Well, I've done it again -- stayed up all night on a web project that is also, ostensibly, a writing project.  There's a hell of a lot on my mind, from a friend who was reportedly going to check herself in for depression, to the sudden news from my sister that she's considering going into the Navy.  And then the talk this afternoon with my dad about his move to Idaho (Idaho!), and how strange it is, on the surface, that I have such strong feelings about no longer having a pretext for going back to San Diego -- whereas I still feel entirely empty about the house I lived in with my mother for four years on Kauai (the longest I'd ever lived anywhere, at that point), which was airlifted by Hurricane Iniki and later, bulldozed.  My mother has acted like I'm crazy for reacting to the Idaho news as I have, but others -- including Annalisa, my sister whose new career ambitions have my mother flummoxed --  do  get it.    Whatever.  It will all be clear when it's all written down.  (Perhaps too clear.)   And, damn it, I forgot to email David Weinstock about his wonderful poem,  Gematriya .

The pet store was selling them for 5\u00a2 each. I thought that was odd since they were normally a couple thousand dollars each. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth.  I bought 200.  I like monkeys.  I took my 200 monkeys home.  I have a big car.  I let one of them drive. His name was Sigmund.  He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in their genitals.  I laughed.  Then they punched my genitals.  I stopped laughing.  I herded them into my apartment.  They didn't adapt very well to their new environment.  They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall.  Although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.  Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive: they all died.  No apparent reason.  They all just sort of dropped dead.  Kind odd like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later.  Damn cheap monkeys.  I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my apartment. On the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase.  It looked like I had 200 throw rugs.  I tried to flush one down the toilet.  It didn't work. It got stuck.  Then I had one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead, dry monkeys.  I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals.  That worked for a while.  That is until they began to decompose.  Then it started to smell real bad.  I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I didn't want to call the plumber.  I was embarrassed.  I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them.  Unfortunately, there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time, so I had to change them every 30 seconds.  I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't all go bad.  I tried burning them.  Little did I know my bed was flammable.  I had to extinguish the fire.  Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed.  The odor wasn't improving.  I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys or use the bathroom.  I severely beat one of my monkeys.  I felt better.  I tried throwing them way but the garbage man said that the city wasn't allowed to dispose of charred primates.  I told him that I had a wet one.  He couldn't take that one either.  I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.  I finally arrived at a solution.  I gave them out as Christmas gifts.  My friends didn't know quite what to say.  They pretended that they like them but I could tell they were lying.  Ingrates.  So I punched them in the genitals.  I like monkeys.\n\nText 2:On my drive home this evening I was listening to The Cure on my iPod using the iTrip, and I was thinking, dang, The Cure is a great band. The song happened to be 'Killing an Arab,' a classic of theirs, and definitely NOTHING to do with hating Arabs or anything--it's based on an event in the book 'The Stranger' by Albert Camus. Anyway, listening to The Cure made me think about a band that kind of made a stir earlier this year, who drew  a lot of comparisons to The Cure. The band was called Hot Hot Heat, and they had a song called 'Bandages' that was kind of in heavy rotation for a while on MTV and KROQ and whatnot. Well, I remember being underwhelmed by that song and by the band in general, and I've realized that I haven't heard a peep about them in a while.   It must suck to be the flavor of the month, don't you think?They broke out at about the same time Interpol (who, by the way, drew a lot of comparisons to Joy Divsion--from me, included) did, but you still hear about Interpol occasionally. Hot Hot Heat? Nada. I'm kind of glad they're gone, actually, because I didn't really like them, but I do feel sorry for them, now that the alt music world has a big hard-on for Franz Ferdinand these days. Who also was underwhelming, I thought. I bought their CD and it's OK but it didn't bowl me over right away. Maybe I'm just an old fogey who thinks the bands I grew up with are just better, but I'm not that impressed! There ARE new songs that I do like, however, most of them heard on Indie 103.1. I love 'Staring at the Sun' by Simple Kid, 'The Still in Love Song' by the Stills, 'Mass Destruction' by Faithless, and a song by The Streets that I don't know the title of."], "gold_label": 0.0}

So, I'm watching the superbowl, and I see like 3 or 4 ads from some group whose goal is apparently to make sure you never take another drag off another cigarette, ever. the ads featured people who had lost loved ones or had some various nasty diseases all because they smoked. There was also a commercial where n*sync showed up at some guy's house and thanked him for not letting his kids drink. I take issue with these 'Sopaboxers', these people who use every oppoutunity to climb on a soapbox, to force their opinions down your throat, who will spend millions of dollars to get a commercial on the superbowl to preach anti-smoking and anti-drinking ideals to a bunch of drunk people with a pack of smokes in their pockets. I have an idea, a solution for all these soapboxers that will make everyone happy -SHUT THE HELL UP! Easy, wasn't it? If you want to influence people, put a sign up in your yard, stand on a corner near the hospital with a sign, hold a conference or a meeting where you can show people what you want to show them. Holding up pictures of dead babies in front of the clinic is only going to offend - not influence - anyone. if someone is on their way to have an abortion, or on their way into the store to buy beer, or already drunk - you've lost them, they aren't going to listen to you - go somewhere else. Of course, if you are dedicated enough to your cause to go forth and try to 'Educate' (or 'force your opinions down the throats of') the people, you are dedicated enough to not listen to a word I'm saying. because I am not of your cause, I am in the wrong, I am only trying to sway you from the right and true cause which you are crusading for, blocking people's paths for, killing people for, being a callous ass for, annoying and offending everyone for.   In case you haven't noticed, I have very strong opinions about having your own opinions -  let me restate that - I encourage you to have your own opinions on everything, don't let other people tell you what you should think, and don't tell other people what you think they should think. If your opinion is the right one, other people will come to have the same opinion as you - all on their own. I don't wear my seatbelt. I don't wear it, not because 'it's uncomfortable' or 'it messes up my clothes' or anything like that. I don't wear it because I can't stand the fact that I am legally compelled to wear it - I am being forced to make myself safe. If it wasn't a law, I'd be fine with it, and I might wear it. I stop at stoplights, I use my turn signal, why not the seatbelt? Because those other things make *everyone* safe - those are things that are right, and that need to be done to ensure the safety of others on the road. The seatbelt, however, protects only me. Why should I have to be safe? If I want to 'live on the edge', it should be my right to do so.\n\nText 2:How about that - almost exactly a year between posts! Keen."], "gold_label": 1.0}

What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?    I like novels and admittedly, I read mostly fiction.  I tend to stay away from newspapers and magazines of substance because I like to stay pleasantly uninformed.  Turns out, I'm not missing much.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My favorite novel?  That's a tough one.  I guess I'll just list SOME of my favorite novels.  I really liked Stephen King's  'Misery.'   It was a bajillion times better than that pathetic movie they made with Kate Bates and Jim Caan.  The movie was Candyland in comparison.  (ooooh...big revelation, the book was better.)  I also like the book  'Filth'  by Irvine Welsh quite a bit.  Then again, I like just about everything that gadge writes.  This is a hard question to answer...it's kind of like asking me what my favorite movie is.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  It's too long to write, but it's  The Cremation of Sam McGee.   You can read it  urlLink here .  I've never been a big poetry buff, but the ones I really tend to like are ones with a story.  Call me a simpleton, but I'm a sucker for a clever tale...    4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  Either the Bible or Dianetics, though I probably never will.  I really want to see what all these religious kooks are making such a big fuss about.  Plus, I want to read about Scientology so I can make fun of it and not feel so guilty.   5. What are you currently reading?  Right now, I'm reading a children's novel by Cornelia Funke called  'The Thief Lord.'   It's pretty good.  Supposedly, she's like almost as popular as JK Rowling in other parts of the world.

It is about a weirdo of a little boy that was coming to the education program at my work. His name, which could be the best part here, is Gockberk. He is from Turkey. And, mind you, he is not a cute Gockberk. The kid has a freakishly huge head and he NEVER stops crying. One day, I was roped into holding him after he had been crying for maybe 30 minutes. I noticed that the poor Gock was dressed in a onesie (the baby underwear that snaps down below), corduroy pants, a heavy dress shirt, and a woolen vest in an 85 degree room. He was all sweaty and uncomfortable looking, so I took off his vest. He stopped crying almost immediately. Just when I was beginning to have some fondness for his large Turkish cranium, his mom came in the room and basically bitched me out in Turkish for removing the precious vest. Well! Poor Gocky had to wear the thing for the rest of the day and pretty much cried for the remainder of the day. None of the kids like him because he never shuts up and he is the only Turkish one in the group. After that, he only came back once and I think his mom requested that I not be allowed to watch him. I just like his name.   Also, there is this crazy show on the WB called  urlLink The BeastMaster . Matt and I were watching it this weekend when there was nothing else on tv. It made us laugh but it was really some Tarzan-esque type of show. Check out the site-- this guy is a real hottie!\n\nText 2:Last night I went to this club Kameleon with my neighbor, Amber, and some pals from  Sully's to dance dance dance to some fine 80's tunes (the new wave kind, not so much Starship).  Of course some of it sucked, but once the DJs got their groove, it was The Cure, Interpol, New Order, James, Blur etc. all the way.  Goodtimes....  Anyway, one of our convos was about how the Catholic Church had recently proclaimed that they will not distribute Communion to any parishoner who is involved with abortion practices(aka a doc who performs them, etc.).  Now is my church, just this past Sunday, our priest gave us a lecture about leaving early and coming late and then dropped the bomb: apparently some people in our church have not been eating their host at Communion and have been leaving it in the pews and song books instead.  Of course for a devout Catholic who believes that the host is actually the body of Christ, this is a tragedy.  As for me, I was just waiting for him to say 'The body of Christ does not belong in the pews or the song books, it needs to get in your belly!'.   Oh and btw, The Cure, Interpol, Mogwai and others will be touring this summer, according to the Cure's website.  Looks like Cincy, Chi-town, and Detroit are all on the list, but no Indy...."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Although he makes some valid points, I am not entirely convinced that just because we can't measure it or it explain it that it does not exist. Sure, there are some real looney toons out there, but you cannot ignore the repeated patterns of some of the strange things that people encounter around the world.  And I'm also reading Barry Glasner's  urlLink The Culture of Fear , which is a look at how the media plays-up rare occurrences to 'increase awareness' and fear, how certain organizations do not represent statistics properly, and how conservatives with money can sway people's opinions with labeling and exaggeration.

Anyway, she was quite cool and I ended up on duty with her at break time, guarding the main hall from little kiddies trying to vandalise anythign and everything. Turns out she doesn't like anyone else in our tutor group either, so I tink it's a safe bet that i'll be spending a lot of time with her in tutor activities. After lunch I had a geography lesson which was a bit boring but also quite bizarre- the teacher sat us down and explained the usual boring stuff, then said 'here's the book cupboard, here's some paper, do something with it' and we were all kind like, 'uh???!' but then she said she wanted us to write notes around the subject of coast lines, ready for our field work trip which is like 4 weeks time! argh! That's then going to be our coursework which has to be done by 5th Novemeber, so it's all getting quite scary already! I also made a sort of buddy in geography called Amy, we shared the books around and helped each other out by swapping notes! how sad am I? I'm jsut desperate to make friends I guess!

I heard about the Glenside Farmers Market and was excited to go and get some local fruits and veggies. Also, according to their flyer, there is a giant orange llama!   So I just got back. There were all of seven vendors, only one of which was selling produce. They only had a small variety of greens. The others sold plants (flowers, little trees, the like) and the remaining vendors sold baked goods or jewelry or soap. Some farmers they are!  And the llama?

I was like awesome!!! And then I decided to go to Taco Bell and I um, sort of ran over the curb a little bit when I was leaving.  I laughed at my self.  Then I came home, and I was like, 'Hey, I think I'll write in my blog!'  So now I am going to go.  Buh Bye.\n\nText 2:CHINA!!!      Hey everyone!  Well, I have now returned from my adventures through Shanghai and Beijing.  It was definitely quite a trip.  It is amazing how different China and Japan are and in many ways this trip enabled me to appreciate many aspects of Japan a lot more.  It also made me realize that over the past 9 1/2 months Japan has definitely come to feel like home.      On to China details...well, we landed in Shanghai after 3 hours on a plane and were quite excited but were immediately faced with the language barrier as we tried to make our way to our hotel. We then learned to always get a card from the hotel and have them write in Chinese characters where we wanted to go. We were then able to just hand it to a cab driver and we were on our way.  We accumulated quite a few cards!!! While in Shanghai we saw the Shanghai Acrobats (really impressive), went to an aquarium, did a day tour out of the city to view some gardens and an old town known as the Venice of China, toured the Bund Area (water front area), went to the Shanghai museum, to the Jade Buddha Temple, and pretty much just wandered around the city a bit.  At times it was quite frustrating as cabs wouldn't always stop for us, people at times could be quite pushy and rude, we were constantly being stared at in a quite uncomfortable way, and apparently spitting is a national sport. I pretty much decided that I wasn't going to let it get to me and was therefore able to accept it as being part of the China experience and not enable those things to prevent me from seeing all of the great things China and Chinese culture has to offer.      On to Beijing...well, we boarded an overnight train and arrived in Beijing 12 hours later.  We made our way to a hotel a lot more easily and were excited to begin our explorations of a new city.  While in Beijing we saw the Beijing Acrobats (incredible!!!), toured Tianenman Square, the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Summer Palace (huge and unbelievably beautiful...had the longest painted covered walkway in the world as well as a marble boat), and did a Hutong Tour which is a tour of one of the original Chinese neighborhoods and we were able to go into a tradition style house and meet and talk with the head of the household.  We obviously also made a trip to the Great Wall.  I can totally understand why the Great Wall is one of the 7 Wonders of the World.  We went to the site at Mutianyu and took a chair lift up the mountain.  We then walked along the great wall with China on one side and Mongolia on the other.  Elizabeth and I continually just stopped walking to take in our surroundings and to realize that we were in fact standing on the Great Wall!  It was incredible!!!  To return back to the bottom there was a metal track and we were able to Toboggan down. Also a lot of fun but the people who went down right before us were a bit slow so we were constantly having to slow down on the track.  All in all an amazing experience at the Great Wall!!!   While in China we of course sampled all sorts of Chinese food.  We had Sichuan, Peking Duck, Mongolian Hot Pot, Cantonese style, Mandarin style...basically a ton of Chinese food and I have now definitely had my fill for a little while.  Anyway, I wanted to give all of you a brief overview of my trip to China but if you are curious to know more just send me an email and I would be very excited and happy to share with you more of the details!!!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Okay, I thought I would be offended when I read about the CoS Primary (even though the current president is an incumbent with an intention to run for re-election, so unless a challenger arises, there is no official 'Republican Primary') but I really wasn't.  My opinions (and handy odds!) are thus:  George W. Bush : Please, Lord, not again. The man led us through September 11th. He did good. He led us into a war in Afghanistan, which didn't lead to serious problems. THE MAN NEEDS A FOUR-YEAR VACATION! After two wars (one that's a losing battle at this point ) he really needs to Get Out. Now. But I like his cabinet. Condolezza Rice kicks ass! Seriously, a viable female candidate if she desires to run. Might give Hillary a run for her money.  Odds 5:1    Bill Gates : Seriously? Can you imagine Bill Gates saying to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 'Commence bombing on select military sites.' That's just all kinds of wrong. The man can't design a good operating system, why would he be good as president?  Odds 50:1    Senator Palpatine : He's the model of a modern Republican. I regret to have said that as now Jonah will begin singing Pirates of Penzance now. But seriously, he is. He's got the geek vote And geeks a group that was essential in Bush's first election bid. Look for him to win a few primaries but peter out around Super Tuesday.  Odds 3:1    The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra : Perfect. Loud, Sarcastic, A little bit bitchy and concise. He's the ideal Republican candidate.  Odds 2:1   By the way, if a box of hair ran against John Kerry in the next primary, it would probably be more in tune with issues, speak more eloquently, and govern the country in a way that's fair to all, even more so than Kerry. But seriously, if you think America needs a president who can snowboard? Then vote for Kerry.  What else was I going to say? I don't know, that's your problem, I sleep now.

Coupled with highly sensitive to emotion, it can lead to many joys of completed projects, many frustrations of poorly done projects.  What is perfectionism?  I find that it is really the combination of its constituents: idealism and stubborness.  We who are perfectionist are very idealistic about the way something should be, and we are stubborn about that ideal.  This is a neutral trait;  it can lead us to do great, not mediocre, things, but it can lead us to be vessels of frustration for ourselves and those we impact.  What is the key to making the most of this character trait?  How does God use this trait while keeping us from attributing glory to ourselves?  Because ultimately, with all my perfectionism, I'm very easily distracted, so I tend to be a frustrated person more than a satisfied, joyful person.  Oh, to apply the Gospel in this situation. Ok, ok.\n\nText 2:Why were the Pharisees the way that we see them in the New Testament?  Why are evangelical Christians in America today generally derided and viewed as a bunch of hypocrites?  I believe the answer to the question is the following:  Christianity in America has become tainted with the 'serve-me' mentality of this culture and human nature and forgotten the message of Christ and the Gospel.  It looks at Christ's miracles and sees them as the reason why He came.  Ministries water down the message of the Gospel to say that it's only there to make you more successful, happier, fitter.  In other words, instead of aligning ourselves to the message of the Gospel, we have started to align the message to us.  Then, because of this false confidence that we 'know God' and will 'get into heaven', Christians start to have a condescending attitude around those not like them.  Preferences and convictions become absolutes, and if they see people with different preferences and convictions, they point fingers.  They see 'the lost' as projects and goals instead of fellow sinners in need of grace.  Oh, God, please, let there be a transformation in the visible church in America.  You are doing great works in many churches in our land... bringing people back to You, in recognizing the difference between absolute and unabsolute, in seeing the reality of sin but the greater reality of Your mercy... in seeing that we are to be ultimately for You, not vice versa.  Bring us back to the point of accountibility called the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that we may be more like Christ instead of trying to make Him more like us.  Open our eyes to see our faults as they are, and to love those we know around us as they are.  Transform us with Your message of grace and point us to You in a way that will not make us self-righteous, but even more humble."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I find it very difficult to hear God.  ....................................................  I grew up in smaller mega-churches, just on the cusp of the nondenominational mega-church movement. The demoninations I grew up in were splinters of splinter groups -- fundamentalist, dispensational, pietistic, non-glossolial, KJV only, bus-ministry-sunday-morning, AWANA clubs sponsoring, REVEREND [insert the name of the senior minister here on the church sign] churches. These were churches that would 'disfellowship' a 'sister church' because they believed in the mid-tribulational rapture of the church instead of the pre-tribulational rapture of the church. These were churches where missionaries mourned the 'cult-like presence of the charismatics' in the developing world countries they worked.   Do I need to clarify that I do not remain in these churches?   Did I *hear God* when I was in them? Probably I did, but to me it was always the voice that was speaking over and against the surrounding babble. The voice of God was the marginal, oppositional, secret sub-text, undermining the proto-text.  But since then...!  I have tried to be faithful, believing as I still do that God has called me to the divine pursuit, but I have found it very difficult to find a tradition / a community / a place to hear God.   Lynn and I have heard God in what's felt like waves and then we've wandered in what's felt like silent deserts for eons.  The last three years in Canton has felt, in general, more like a dessert. We visited 17 churches, tried to stay in three, had a wonderful homechurch experience that didn't work out.  When I mentioned to Lynn that people would be standing up in church on Palm Sunday to praise God, I thought I saw her eyes fill with disappointment. I read in her gaze -- what does that have to do with us? God is not talking to us these days. And while I wanted to have a different feeling. Those words reflected by deepest suspicions.  But this past Sunday our church invited the congregation to stand up and talk about God's presence in their lives. Harry (the minister) threatened that if no one stood up, Ebeneezer might just start in (Ebeneezer is a 3'x2' boulder awkwardly placed in the sanctuary alongside the --; a boulder that Harry hauled into the sanctuary ten years ago when he arrived as a marker of where God had brought the church then).  People stood up and told stories for the next hour and I cried quietly for the whole time.  The stories were about children with precarious physical conditions and horribly specific dietary needs, about losing a baby after two weeks, about losing a seventeen year old sister in the middle of a long unemployment spell, about feeling Grace while marking the fourth year of being widowed. People losing jobs, bumbling through vocations with surprising profit, finding shocking grace in small 'lowly' work, being healed from a fear of marriage.  These people were (I felt astonished) hearing God in their loss, hearing Vocation in the accidents of their work (!), finding truth in the unbearable sacrifices of the quotidian.  When I first read Sacred Journey, I felt the same quiet tears of relief. That *YES* God could speak to us through the unexpected. Through what was around us. Through our accidents and mistakes.   Everyone was calling out Hosannah on Palm Sunday. Jaelyn, my daughter kept using her palm branch to tickle the 23 year old woman in the row before us, who I do not know. The woman was crying, but laughed every time the branch brushed her. Jaelyn's eyes were delighted by everything. When the drums were pounded she raised the branch high and swayed it back and forth. This caused our eleven year old friends David and Michael to laugh.   For the first time in a long time I feel like I am MOVING. That I have a step to make. That my leg is already extended, and I cannot, on any count see where it will land, but I don't care. I want to go. I want to move.\n\nText 2:.......... limin ..........  my friend / student ryan writes about liminality and limin (one of my favorite topics) and asks in  urlLink today's blog , whether:     Does everyone always feel they are at an in-between stage?

People, boats, twinkling lights are all spread out before me. Voices, Arabic, French, German, occasionally English almost drown out the gentle shush shush of the sea. The boats make a complicated interplay of shadows and reflections. Bare masts stand tall like some secret semaphored message.     So many people. Families, small children, couples with their arms around each other, heads close as they whisper and laugh together. I wish that MJ was holding my hand. The sense of being an outsider, a ghost who barely disturbs the air by her presence, is very strong tonight. Yet I am content. To be alone is not something to be feared. Loneliness is not always painful. The air is pleasantly warm, the juice cold and fresh. I observe and store up pictures in my mind to recall on other days when Tunisia is merely a distant memory.     Tucked away in the corner of the marina I found an art gallery with an exhibition of works by Tunisian artists. One particular painting caught my attention and I kept coming back to it. A man, whom I took to be the gallery owner approached and if there was anything in the exhibition that spoke to me particularly. I pointed. He smiled. It was his painting, he was the artist! His English was heavily accented and not easy to understand, but still we spent the most wonderful hour discussing his work. I am thrilled by this unexpected gift of interesting conversation handed to me from no where. I wish I could afford to buy the painting, maybe one day.     There is so much I want to see and do and experience while I am here.  At the same time, I am content.  Content to simply be."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Some conversation is going on about rides scratched at Alton Towers, but for this blog it is more important to reflect upon the events of the last 2 B10!  When I last left off, we were off to the beach.  Upon arriving, we broke up into a couple of groups.  Some headed straight for the sand, while another group of us decided to see some fish up close and personal at the aquarium.  We got to see shark feeding time from a submerged transparent walkway in a rather large tank full of sharks, stingrays, and giant turtles.  After boing up on our natural sciences, the others I was with decided to do bumper cars, but I decided to take the rare opportunity to allow this land-locked resident of Switzerland with no closeby beach to walk along the Bournemouth coast and take in the the local scenery and beach babes!!!  We then all met up and took the train back, linking up with another group of spods who had chosen to forsake the beach wonders for the safer realms of a local pub.  It was time then to prepare for the big night out at Jazz Juice!  We first went to a couple of watering spots in Bournemouth to soak up some liquor and then made our way back to near the beach and into the nightclub.  JazzJuice was basically a 70s retro night.  We danced or sat on the edge of the dancefloor until about 2.00 am.  Then we grabbed taxis and headed back to consume a midnight snack before hitting the sack.  We also got to observe why it was not a good idea for a taxi company to ever dissapoint our meet host ...  After the spods finally awoke on Sunday morning, we went to a local establishment for some traditional English breakfasts.  The Sunday afternoon event was either bingo or the water park, depending on one's tastes.  Your blogger personally chose the waterpark choice, and despite the long ques, he was not disappointed with the miriad of slides and tube rides ...  It was then dinner at KFC (a treat for me as there are none in Switzerland) and then bowling, followed by some goes at the Dance Dance video game machine.  Then back to Matt's for another renedition of 'Fire Wire.'  Its now 2.30 am and time for some sleep!\n\nText 2:i agree with jimi and whoever doesn't is a fool.  aye!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

I'm looking again and I still can't believe it. Time, when you have nothing to do just drags, until your life just resembles a skid mark. Ladies...when you're bleedin', and all you want is a cigarette but can't be fucked going over and getting your papers and filters, and tobacco...what do you do? Hmm, I'm looking at my beautiful Sims CD, I remember the days when I used to play that game everyday, usually when I woke up, play a few hours while eating breakfast then go out just after Jerry Springer. It was a great time, but I got fat from sitting down too much and drinking shitloads of Milo. Actually I think I was severely depressed and had issues about daylight and regular human contact. Those were bitter times. I think I will throw the CD Case across the room now. No. I won't be doing that. I really hate not having a job, not having money, I went all fucking crazy coming down from MCK/MCX double fucking dose, I lost my fucking wallet at the same time which I can fucking assure you, was not fun. Gee, was calling the cops fun? Was freaking out, looking through garbage fun? The party was massive, there was around 100 plus people here in this house, 95% of which I did not know, and I stupidly leave my wallet near the computer. It's now gone, and I remember picking that wallet out with CB, I had dragged him all around Newtown and then finally dragged him all over George St, starting from Charlie's and finding one at a tobacconists. Damn it, it was such a beautiful leather wallet. CB has called me twice from work now, I told him I was bleeding and thus to LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE...but then I was all happy and shit that he called...and it's not his fault I'm emotionally erratic. I don't know...boyfriends can be weird. Okay, more than likely, I'm weird. I was coming down real hard last night, and I had a fight with Been, because of it. When two people are coming down and one doesn't KNOW that they are coming down, it's just fucking tense. I told her that it was just because we were chemically burnt out and she agreed. I mean it was just so stupid. But fucking hell, I don't want any more parties at my house, I don't want them AT ALL, they are simply just too much hassle. Damn my cigarette went out and the cat food is on fire. Be right back. I found a McDonald's apple pie in the fridge, it's been there for three days, when CB and Been were stoned and came back with all this free shit, I think it was around 4AM, five apple pies they scored for free, and they were dumped in the fridge. I feel ill now, I actually only eat the pies or the occasional stoned cheeseburger, and I have to be stoned to enjoy that shit. Stoned and sedated with Cat Stevens...You know, Been and Vicksen (her new nick...now...) said that they were going to call professional cleaners, but when? I mean come on, when? I know it's not going to happen and everyone will have to wait until I get well to clean this house up. Last Monday I had to go to an Interview for Coles Myers, for Liquorland, and it was a disaster. There were people from everywhere applying for the job and a lot of them; well they just looked like they were desperate to get it. One was an engineer, mid 40's who was made redundant earlier this year. Another one was applying for a manager position, he was from a cellar in Perth, another one was this kid named Adam who just graduated from High School and used to work at Aporto's in Newtown...and around 4 Asians who just needed a legal job. Fuck, it was just insanity, and then thankfully, I got a call from the manager at the Dendy, that independent cinema I applied to two weeks ago, and she wants to see me tomorrow at 3:30pm. Shit. I'm bleeding and have no anecdotes. Fuck, fuck, fuck. But cinema work, is what I know and love, just for its flexibility, and well its closer to home and it might give me more room and space AND money to be able to paint. Wish me luck. Please.

It must be strange for him, spending time with someone who's head of state even though they weren't elected, just because of who their family is.  The security crackdown here is unbelievable.  I read in yesterday's newspaper that 1 in 9 policemen, nationwide, is involved in the security operation surrounding Bush. Half the police in all of London, too, apparently.  If I weren't marching tomorrow, I think I'd carry out a few burglaries as far from George as possible.  Eva and I have been talking about ways of protesting Bush while making it difficult for the media to portray it as mindless 'anti-Americanism', which is an accusation Blair has made, predictably.  Any ideas?  Richard Dawkins said he wanted to see a burning American flag behind Bush in every shot, but Eva thinks this'll just look threatening to people in the US, and I can see her point.

We have thrown the gender switch,' said Christina Hoff Sommers, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of 'The War Against Boys.' 'What does it mean in the long run that we have females who are significantly more literate, significantly more educated than their male counterparts? It is likely to create a lot of social problems. This does not bode well for anyone.' and 'As a nation, we simply can't afford to have half of our population not developing the skill sets that we are going to need to go into the future,' said Susan L. Traiman, director of the group's education initiative  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38887-2002Jun24.html\n\nText 2:First, a little randomness. Probably the next few days will have little coherence to them { 'and this is different, how...?' saith the audience }, probably a bit here and there, and who knows, maybe even some poetry { as the audience begins to delete this web address }. But, hopefully it will be interesting. Before I forget, though - make sure to give a look at  urlLink this quiz , on the topic of 'What Kind of Elitist Are You?' I ended up getting the same elitist type as  urlLink the Teaching Assistant . Personally, I was hoping for 'old-school aristocrat,' but I don't think the quiz had such a category. Pity.  As another random note,  urlLink Bookslut  informs us that  urlLink Amazon.com  will be making the review process a little more stringent. Another pity. As Jessa  urlLink says , ' My only fear is that fewer junior high and high school students will be able to grace us with genius such as this: 'SUCK BIG BANANAS.... the book should never be read again, it has no poit to it , the book was poorley writen and everyone should burn the book if thay have a copy' '.  So, back to the first randomness, being a 'book and language snob' doesn't sound so bad after reading such insights.  But enough of that.  Now to something with a little of a point. I'm just about to go over some of the lectures for the last week of the summer session, and here we are dealing with the medievals. I must admit, I'm looking forward to it. While St. Augustine probably will always be the  primus inter pares  in my 'great thinkers' list, many of the medieval thinkers rank right up there. On the downside, there is too much of a tendency to look at the time period from the fall of the Western Roman Empire until the Renaissance (or Reformation, or the so-called Enlightenment) as a vast wasteland of superstition, pedantry, near-totalitarian papal rule, and general chaos. By doing so, nearly one thousand years of learning are lost, often addressing questions and issues better than the moderns have or do. On the upside (for me), my dissertation chair is a medieval scholar, and opened the student's eyes to a grand world.  So (and whether this is an upside or downside for the audience, I leave to the side), collected here is a short list of some medieval works/thinkers/secondary works that may be of interest to those wanting to jump into an exciting and unique intellectual  milieu .  --As I study politics, I figure I should start with some of the better selection lists. For sheer breadth, a place to start would be   urlLink From Irenaeus to Grotius: A Sourcebook in Christian Political Thought 100-1625  , by the O'Donovans (Oliver and Joan Lockwood). Along with the self-protection benefits of this tome (it's thick enough to withstand .357 caliber bullets) (don't ask how I know), it is exhaustive in terms of collecting as many thinkers as possible. But, with increased quantity, there is a tendency for decreased quality - while you can get a glimpse of what these thinkers were trying to get across, it remains just that, a glimpse. There are two works that are more focused on the medievals that will be of more use, one being Brian Tierney's   urlLink The Crisis of Church and State 1050-1300   [good for selections of texts from various leaders, papal, imperial, and other], and the other being Nederman & Forhan's   urlLink Readings in Medieval Political Theory 1100-1400   [focused more on the great thinkers of the time].  --Now to primary texts (or as best as one can come to them if you don't read Church Latin and can't swing by England or Italy for six months). No doubt the most famous of the medievals in the West would be St. Thomas Aquinas. The trick, of course, is that Thomas wrote somewhere in the neighborhood of eight million words during his short lifetime - where to begin, and what should be read first, being difficult. Just on the philosophical side, probably one should start with his  urlLink volumes    urlLink Summa   urlLink Contra   urlLink Gentiles   (five books - couldn't find part II of Book Three at Amazon, but I know it must be there). Here, Thomas shows how, by using Aristotelian science, one could come to some truths about God, creation, and so forth. This would be a good introduction to his style of thinking. Then, of course, if you have the resources, one should definitely look at his   urlLink Summa Theologiae  .  But, there were other thinkers than just Thomas. So, for a different look at the medieval mind through the eyes of a contemporary, start with this  urlLink introduction  to a group of texts from St. Bonaventure, the general of the Franciscan Order. His 'The Soul's Journey into God' is rather interesting. Unlike the Aristotle-inspired, Dominican Thomas, Bonaventure is more in line with the Augustinian (and neo-platonic) way of thinking. Makes for a nice comparison.  And there are other thinkers, as well. The list, naturally, is not exhaustive, but just points to some that might be interesting. So, for instance, there is John of Salisbury, a cleric in England, who wrote the   urlLink Policraticus  . Probably most famous for giving a (somewhat qualified) justification for tyrannicide, John also explicates a notion of the 'body politic,' using this metaphor (though possibly looking at it as more than a metaphor) to show the interconnections and linking together of a kingdom like that of a human body. Most interesting stuff - the version linked to is a good translation, but it should be noted that it is an extended selection, and not the whole of the text.  While most of us are familiar with Dante via   urlLink The Divine Comedy   (or at least   urlLink The Inferno  ) from earlier education, he also wrote some works of a more explicitly political bent. One that stands alone would be   urlLink Monarchy  , in which Dante makes the case for basically a world empire. Given the tensions between the Church and State throughout the Middle Ages, one came to expect the thinkers of the age to side with one or the other, the ecclesiastical or the political. Dante chose the political (for a variety of reasons). While Dante the poet is never far from sight, this work is much more a formally logical treatise than literature. For those interested in medieval politics, Dante, or both, certainly worth a read.  Another thinker taking the side of the political, and also a good read, would be Marsilius (Marsiglio) of Padua, and his work   urlLink Defensor Pacis  . Marsiglio tries something a little different in this text (different, at least, for the time) - he wants to explicate a theory of state and society which leaves to the side the question of revelation (dedicating the second half of the book, if memory serves, to explicating how things get screwed up when the spiritual institutions attempt to interfere with the business of the temporal). In terms of political theory, he is certainly a fellow to read, whether focused only on the Middle Ages or not.  Then there is the great mind of Nicholas of Cusa, and his   urlLink The Catholic Concordance  . This is a work to start with on Cusanus, but certainly not a place to stop. His own history is interesting - starting as a part of the concilliarist party (for which the  Concordance  was written), he then become a strong supporter of the papacy. While this work is more concerned with the idea of the Church, and also of representation (for which he gets a greater deal of attention now), he was responsible for writing on sundry other topics, including a rather good work on the possibility of toleration.  There are many many others, but that's a start.  --Then there are some secondary works which might be worth your while. Some works that either introduce or expand upon a particular thinker would include James McEvoy's introductory book on  urlLink Robert Grosseteste  (a bishop in England, among the earliest individuals at Oxford, and writer of various treatises, with excellent insight into light); Dennis Tamburello's (admittedly less rigorous) introduction to  urlLink St. Bernard of Clairvaux ; and finally a more in-depth inspection of Marsiglio of Padua in Nederman's   urlLink Community and Consent  .  A more general introduction to the Middle Ages, of an acceptable quality, would be Luscombe's   urlLink Medieval Thought   (part of a serious on Western philosophy). It's not terribly expensive, and does give the reader a good feel for some of the more major (and not so major) thinkers of the time.  There are other secondary sources that may also be of interest. In terms of religion, or more specifically heresy, Lambert's   urlLink Medieval Heresy   is a good place to start - it gives the reader a broad overview of the heresies that were about, their suspected origins, and the like. Most fascinating. A work on a more specific heresy that I read recently, and found rather well done, was that of David Burr on the  urlLink Spiritual Franciscans  (a movement that would involve, to various levels of directness, Marsiglio of Padua, William of Ockham, and various others).  On the more political side, immediately two works come to mind (thought many more are possible). One of interest would be Joseph Strayer's monograph   urlLink On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State  . While a short text (about 120 pages), Strayer does a wonderful job of showing the developments through the Middle Ages that would form the elements of later political forms. From another angle comes the (not nearly as short) work of Ernst Kantorowicz, the amazing   urlLink The King's Two Bodies  . This magisterial book looks at the connections of legal theory, political theory, and theology, in terms of symbols, logical patterns, and the like, to flesh out the medieval notion of the one (sooner-or-later to be dead) body of the king with the other (never-dying) body of the king. The author is, admittedly, very German - so, in other words, the prose is dry enough to make New Orleans into a dust bowl - making the book at times a hard read. But very much worth it.  I was about to list some more, but I just saw how much is already in this post. So, Medievalpalooza must end for today.  There will be a quiz next week, so start reading.

Just this morning I was griping to myself about the fact that blogging is now pretty much completely out of my normal life.  That is, I used to sit down to blog because I had something I wanted to say (most of the time), now I blog because I feel like I ought to and when I sit down to do so I then have to come up with something to say.  Which lately has been pretty much about Melissa being sick.  But lately my life has pretty much been about Melissa being sick.  Suffice it to say that I look forward to having blogging be a part of my normal life again.  Ok, bullet time:  - I just looked back over my recent posts and realized that although I have griped about Melissa being sick, I haven't really given an overall summary . . . not that you probably wanted one anyway.  Basically, though, here's the scoop:  Since the 14th of last month (that's Valentine's Day for those of you who, er, hadn't been reminded) she has been completely bed-ridden.  As in, the only thing that makes her leave the horizontal position is the call of nature.  Any other forays into vertical (or even semi-vertical, i.e. sitting) territory have been greeted with immediate vomiting.  She has been to the E.R. twice and they have been largely unhelpful -- although getting some IV fluid in never hurts.  Pretty much the current diagnosis is that she has really bad morning sickness combined with some flu bug or something else that is putting her over the edge.  Even when she's not actually throwing up she has such bad nausea that she is hardly coherent.  Earlier this week we seemed to have a bit of a break but the last two days have been back to more of the same.  She's now 10 weeks along -- 12 weeks is the end of the first trimester, when most women start feeling better.  But at this point two more weeks of this seems like an eternity -- and there's no guarantee that anything will change then.  Some women are literally unable to get out of bed for the whole 9 months.  (Footnote:  I don't know how their families survive.)  So I guess we're hoping that she  does  have the flu or something because that would mean that she will definitely feel better once she's kicked it.  -  urlLink Starbucks  will soon be nothing more than an entry in my resume.  I'm starting work for  urlLink CNF  on Monday.  I really don't know what to think yet -- time will certainly tell.  - I drove by  urlLink Krispy Kreme  this morning and thought, 'mmmmm . . . donut' (yes that was exactly the first thing that popped into my head when I saw the sign).  I decided I would go in and buy a donut.  One donut.  I walked in the door and was greeted by a smiling face who said, 'Welcome to Krispy Kreme -- would you like to try a fresh hot donut?'  As he said this he turned and pulled one of the conveyor belt and handed it to me.  As I ate my donut I wondered what to do -- I had just gotten my one donut.  I bought a dozen.\n\nText 2:Alright, before you read any further, go read  urlLink  this .  Go do it -- it's important.    Go read it because it's what I want to be when I grow up.  Really.  Ok, just in case you didn't or couldn't read it, that's a link to a job description of a guidance counselor position at a high school for MKs in Camaroon.  Wycliffe would like to have the position filled by fall of this year at the latest.  That's a little soon.  According to the Wycliffe guy who calls us every few months or so (and is awesome) Wycliffe has recently changed their limits for how much debt they'll take someone with.  A couple can now join Wycliffe with as much as $36,000 in debt . . . we've got more like $20,000 between us.    I'm kind of stumbling over my words here because there's lots of pieces to this that all need to be communicated but still won't add up to any of you what they add up to for us.  Here's the deal:  We have known for a long time that we wanted to go serve the Lord overseas somewhere.  Have we been 'called'?  I don't know.  What I do know is that we're willing and lots of other people aren't.  The other thing I know is that we're excited about the idea of it too.  But ever since Melissa and I met (and before that as individuals) we have wondered what capacity we would serve in -- lots of things sound appealing, but few really seemed to *fit*.  Plus there's been this whole debt issue -- we've got to get our debt paid off (or at least paid down some more) before we can even consider going anyway.    But this weekend we simultaneously find out that we could be going  right now  if we raised enough support to pay for our debt payments  and  we find a position that, as far as we can see, is just about the best fit possible.  I had never before thought about being a guidance counselor . . . just not the first thing on my mind, I guess . . . but the more I think about it the more sense it makes -- it seems to fit perfectly with who I am, how I interact with people, and what impact I would like to make.  Which is of course not to say that I want to do it forever, but it sure does sound great for the near future.  The position in Camaroon will (hopefully) be filled well before we're available, of course.  But it has given me a glimpse of vision again, of something to reach for again.    And we are moving forward again . . . maybe quicker than we yet realize."], "gold_label": 1.0}

(Well I can pretend right?) Anyways, here is a bit of an update on the adventures on my life.  Mouse Foetus Adventure: Well the mouse that I had attempted to rescue died. It didn't even make it through the day. It was sort of sad, but I am glad that I do not have to be taking care of it now. It is a lot of work! I went and bought all the food for it, like baby formula and such and then I had to feed it every 2 hours. So much work! I am totally glad that I am not parent! That is just a responsiblity that I do not need right now.  Jr. High: This week at camp is Jr. High (13-15 year olds) and to be honest it is my favourite age group because they try to be so cool and it usually backfires against them. And they are at the age where I can joke and be silly with them still. It's a lot of fun. The gorup of kids we have are an excellent group though. Lots of fun with them! We almost had to send one boy home and I am really glad we didn't. He is such a neat kid and really needs to be at camp because 'home' sucks, so I am so glad to be at camp getting to know kids and make a difference in their lives!  Monday Night: So a bunch of people have been praying for me to get a car, because as a full time student and a youth leader and living in a small city - public transit sucks and is time consuming. So on Monday during our staff bible study I asked the staff to pray all summer long that I would get a car because well I can't really afford to buy one and so God needed to just drop one on my lap.  So Monday after dinner I went for a run (cause I am trying to get in shape - laugh, it's okay). And as I am running back this car passes me and I thought to myself that the driver looked like my dad, but that wasn't our car. So I continue towards the camp and I see this car parked at the public beach and no one was around. I thought this was odd, but lots of people park and walk a trail that is nearby. So I continue to camp and come in the back  and join the kids at Vespers. My brother who is a camper this week informs me that my mom, dad and other brother are here to pick up my sister for her day off. So being the good daughter I am I went to go see my family and my dad says we need to talk so let's walk towards the beach. Now I am trying to figure out what he is going to talk about. So he tells me about his work and this lady who volunteers and how she thinks my dad is cool and does a good job. And so she had decided to give my dad her car because she is dying of cancer and cannot use it anymore. Which lead to my father giving it to me because I really needed one and my parents knew it would benefit me. So all I can say is that God is amazing! And WOW!! I am so overwhelmed! A car of my own!! It's a nice little sporty dodge neon, a 95 but it only has 60K on it and it is in good shape! It is going to be such a blessing to have that to do youth ministry come the fall! Woot!   The rest of the week: It has been busy, busy. I have been working 12hour days since Sunday, and yes that happens at camp. I haven't really gotten involved with the program because cooking and ordering have taken so much time!  But tonight I will be back in time for campfire so that is going to be fun! And Saturday is the Royal Rumble!! The last one for a while since the Jr. High program director is moving to PEI in Sept. She is soo awesome! She is 61 years old and has run our Jr. High program for the last 10 years! She doesn't look any older than 45 and is so neat! I hope that I am like her when I am 61!   So next week I am program directing an outdoors program for 10-12 olds and it is only 5 days instead of 7 which is good. I still need a female leader and a Bible Study leader, but I know God will provide so it's all good.   Well it is my day off and so I have a lot to do before I have to head back!          posted by Sanda |  urlLink 9:48 AM  urlLink  postCount('108929624358987533');    |  urlLink  postCountTB('108929624358987533');"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Does anyone have a guess when the last time Virginia voted for a Democrat was?  It's not as far off as you might think.  Answer at the bottom.   The first time after reconstruction that Virginia voted for a Republican was 1928 (Herbert Hoover).  It also the first time that a majority of the Confederate states did not vote Democratic.  60 years after the Civil War, they were still holding a grudge against the Republican party for ending slavery.  1964 - LBJ.\n\nText 2:Think of it as a family for a second.  My father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  They bicker and argue with each other quite a bit (at least they did when they were younger).  But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before.  That is the way it is here.  We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself.  Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off.  However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys.  It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.

I had forgotten how much that trip touched me.  On our way to Toronto, we stopped at the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes, I met Sister Marguerite, who I spoke with for almost half an hour speaking with, and when I left she gave me the special blessing of Our Lady to carry to the youth from all over the world who I would be meeting with, who she said were the Torch-bearers, Our Lady's soldiers of love.  When we got to Toronto, we met our hosts, whose house we would be living in for a week.  Our hosts names were Gerry and Kath.  They had moved to Toronto from England, and they were the most loving people I have ever met in my entire life.  Everything we could possibly have needed they had for us, which included leaving pices of chocolate on our bed every day.  The first night of World Youth Day 300,000 people gathered, and we had Mass together.  I have never felt such great faith in one place.  And I rather doubt I ever will.  It was amazing to hear the Our Father said in so many different languages at once, It truly was beautiful.   Finally the day came when I got to see the pope.  I think it is impossible to describe the aura that surrounds him, or what its like to hear him speak, despite his Parkinsons...  We slept outside with the whole community on the last night, and woke up in the morning to celebrate Mass with the Holy Father.  He blessed us all as we left. When it was time to leave Toronto, Gerry traced the sign of the cross on our foreheads, and kissed both our cheeks, yet another  blessing that had been placed on.  I truly am so blessed. I couldn't even begin to list the miracles that have occured in my life. Thank you.\n\nText 2:I love my blog.  Its a giant hunk of me!  I am very bored.  Goodnight."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I saw him on the television box at work.  I only got a small glimpse, though.  Munish was trying to show me what channel HBO was in case people called the front desk to ask.  I saw this man UP CLOSE not even 4 years ago.  Ayden, Mitch, Trast and I went to a Nader rally.  I made a sign with Nader's head on a Kermit the Frog body that said, 'It's so easy being green'.  Personally, I voted for Harry Brown, but I wanted to hear Michael Moore and Nader speak.  Nader looked like your average older man.  He's kind of ugly, but physically he seemed to be holding his own.  I'd go so far as to say he looked good.  If any of you have seen recent footage or pictures of Nader, you'll know that dude is looking haggard and only vaguely like himself.  It's terrible.  His entire face is gaunt, but sagging!  His nose looks like it's about to drop right off of his face.    The first (and obvious) thought I had was that perhaps aliens sucked the life out of him and are using his body.  The second is that the GOP got to him first.  They killed and zombified him and are using him to do their bidding.  Hey, it could be the Democrats.  What do we   really  know about Kerry?  Could he have evil powers?  Is Nader going to burst into the song, 'I've Got No Strings' at his next appearance?  Then it dawned on me!  Perhaps the  real  Nader is bound and gagged somewhere, maybe dead, maybe only barely hanging on to his life.  Perhaps some darker enemy is masquerading as Nader.  Look at the photos, I beg you!  Could this man be Sadaam?  You have to admit, there is some resemblance.  I am gathering evidence!  Check back here regularly.  I'll send a sign to all of those with me once I am ready to confront this poor look a like.

Sunlight has a big impact on my productivity and mood. Having sunlight enter your room in the morning really makes a big difference in getting your ass up out of bed at a respectable hour. Also it makes you feel less sluggish and energized. Note to self: make sure you have sunlight where you live next year!  Another couple of interesting things... well it looks like a certain someone will probably be going back to Nielsen, thus making my summer laboring quite awkward. Steff told me that the fact that I do think about 'burying the hatchet' means that I don't feel like I have closure over the situation (I'm paraphrasing and interpreting here). I think... that is kind of true. Anyway... I'm feeling more curious than worried at this juncture about a lot of things concerning this... simply because the office is going through a lot of changes anyway.  Also I talked to someone from my past as well. It's been almost 2.5 years since I last talked to her. It was whatever... kind of weird though... I mean, the last time I talked to her, Clinton was still the president.  This stuff isn't really weighing on my mind though... more like making me go... hmm?  Oh yea, I rented the Punkorama DVD via NetFlix. It actually isn't bad, but not great like the CDs. A decent mix of old and new videos (made better by being able to turn the subtitles on for lyrics). The extras are alright. I think the history of Epitaph thing would have been better with some old photos not cheesy cartoons of Fletcher starting fires and being surrounded by cops. Oh and there's Greg and Brett on a row boat in Germany in 1992. Greg looks so lame in his stripped tube socks and Cornell hockey t-shirt. If I run into him in a few days when I visit Cornell (finally!) I'm gonna make fun of him... even more so if his hair is still slicked back.  ***\n\nText 2:urlLink The National Coalition on Health Care and several bipartisan government representatives have been speaking out about rising health care costs and prescription drug prices.

(this only confirms my theory that short ppl have aggressive personalities to compensate for their size. if you are short, don't be offended. i am only telling it like i see it.) I also learned that every night after we go into the backyard to feed and play with our dogs, Teddy sits and turns his back to us while we get ready to go back in the house. and when i call his name, i can see that his eyes have become red and misty. am i hallucinating or are dogs capable of crying??  i am currently re-reading The Alchemist. mark my words, this is the most beautiful, most illuminating, most relatable book of all time. it is the one that i want to have cremated with me when i die. a background: this story is about a shepherd boy who travels from his homeland in spain to the egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the pyramids. he does not know what this treasure is, but is convinced that it is part of his Personal Legend. along the way he meets all these different characters who are also on their own quest. 'what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a meditation of the treasures found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our heart.'  some excerpts: 'What's the world's greatest lie?' the boy asked, completely surprised. 'It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.' (an old man the boy meets along the way)  But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.  When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he never dreamed of when he first made the decision.  The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because it's all written there.  ...people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.  It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them.  The problem is that they don't realize that they're walking a new road every day. They don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.  To realize one's Personal Legend is a person's only real obligation.       Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.      At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. when he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke--the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert.\n\nText 2:Hi\u2026.today was a quite a exciting day. Had com election. I tink it was lyk abit sucky coz I was kinda nervous.

What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   [PB, I loved your quote.  My grandmother used to say 'in order to really clean up, you have to make a mess.']  But the quote that best fits my outlook is '...isn't it worth missing whatever joy you might have dreamed, to wake in the night and find you and your beloved are holding hands in your sleep?'  Because, to me, it speaks to the need to find happiness in the real world and the everyday and in the bonds we all have with others, be they friends or lovers.   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   Nearing full implementation with a challenging project at work.  Close second:  last year around this time, I got an eagle on a long par five (three wood, four iron and 15 foot putt).   4. What about the past ten years?   No question:  becoming a father.   5.

I hope you had a wonderful holiday with family and friends. President Bush wishes you a Happy Easter too. Read his Easter greeting  urlLink here !  Ked and I kept it pretty low key today. We went to church, came home and had a light dinner together. Then we called our families and chatted with all of them for quite awhile. It was good to catch up with everyone and rub in how warm it was today! It was nice to just relax together at home this afternoon. Then this evening our friends Bobby and Susan came over for dinner. Ked and Bobby went out to play basketball and got rained out. We had a wonderful thunderstorm come through this evening. We had a great visit with them and just really enjoy doing life together with them. They've become great friends since we moved here.  Last night we went to my great Aunt Jean and Uncle Lowell's house for some pizza! We had a great time visiting with them. They will be heading back to Ohio this week. We've really enjoyed getting to know them while they were down and look forward to seeing them next winter! On our way home, Ked and I were commenting on how many people we've been able to see since we moved here. We've seen family just about every month since we moved. That's been a nice treat. There's a handful of relatives that vacation down here regularly that we will now see more often than when we lived up north! And of course our goal is to get as many people to relocate down here as possible!!!  Well, I'm tired. I think that's it for today. Maybe next week I'll get more creative again. I have some holiday thoughts I'd like to process with you and get your input on. Maybe tomorrow.\n\nText 2:Wow! What a fun day! I feel so much better after sleeping in today.

Then Ben, Jason, Shayna and I decided to go see Spiderman 2 since Jason and Shayna hadn't seen it yet. I saw it last week up in Traverse with Cession but I was more than willing to see it again! What a great movie! Then we came home for Mom's famous Sunday night pizza and we watched Ice Age.

Oh, in other big news tonight--- my younger brother Jason got engaged this morning!! He asked Shayna to marry him this morning at a park. They didn't tell us until tonight. I noticed her ring at lunch, and the thought crossed my mind that they might be engaged.

The intention (as described in my  urlLink www.mydemos.com  blog) is to have a separate environment where I can install fresh copies of every cool Microsoft development tool I can get my dirty hands on. My current home PC has had so many installs and uninstalls, that I would prefer to be working in a clean environment.  So I installed Virtual PC (Trial Edition). Two days later,  urlLink my hard drive crashed . It was no big deal, since Virtual PC was the only software installed on the entire drive. I got a new hard drive and thought I could just start over.  Of course, what was a bigger deal was reinstalling Virtual PC. The installed program refused to install it a second time, instead attempting to uninstall it. Since the program directory is gone, the uninstall fails. Can't install. Can't uninstall. Great. Solution? Go into the Windows registry and manually delete all references to Virtual PC. Once I did that, it installed.  Next challenge was installing an operating system into the new virtual space. It took me hours (no kidding) to figure out how to get Windows XP Professional to install there. Think of it like this. There is NO OS. Nothing but a blank C: drive. So I get a DOS boot floppy disk. But wait, DOS doesn't recognize the CD-ROM. OK, I get a DOS boot disk that recognizes the CD-ROM, but it doesn't recognize the C: drive. Perhaps C: is formatted NTFS, so I get a boot disk that recognizes NTFS. No dice, it's formatted FAT32. So I get another boot disk that recognizes both the CDROM and FAT32. Great, now the SETUP.EXE for the Windows XP CD won't run - 'can't be run in DOS mode'. Geez, Windows XP!!! What the HECK do you want from me?  Now I finally got past that issue, and it is taking HOURS for Windows XP to install. Copying files... I'm just about ready to give up. Something is wrong.  So the first surprise of this experience is that it's taken me 24 hours to get from installing Virtual PC to the 'Copying Files' part of Windows XP setup."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I'm not asking why you hate George Bush, but why should I consider voting for Kerry?  I have not seen many people excited about voting for him.  I have seen plenty of people seething with hatred toward a man who has led us through a recession, terrorist attack, and massive corporate scandals, to the point that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates to 'cool down the economy' (on a side note, I never have understood that reasoning).  I know plenty of people who hate him because he says what he believes and he does (or trys to do) what he says.  I asked Ben that question and got the very honest answer that he really wasn't voting for Kerry but against Bush.  I am probably in the same boat, on the opposite side.  I am a conservative.  I am for small government.  I believe that people are the answer to problems, not government.  I am probably more Libertarian than Republican, but until the Libertarians get off the 'legalize pot' argument as their primary campaign issue, I'll have to settle for the Republicans.  Don't misuderstand me, I think pot should be legalized and regualted, but they make a major PR gaff by making that their primary issue.  George Bush has disappointed me in many ways.  He has introduced some radically liberal, big government, social programs that I disagree with.  But, he has many more of my values than John Kerry.  In fact, I think that I only share one value with John Kerry - we both like living/breathing (as versus being dead).  Add to that the fact the he will not make a stand on an issue (i.e. waffling back and forth), then I have no respect for him at all.

Students can 'grade' their professors on several scales including looks, course ease, helpfulness, and clarity.  It is really popular and there are tons of ratings on the site.  This endeavor has also gotten a lot of press in the last several years.  While this may prove useful to some, the ratings are fraught with peril.  Generally, only students who are unhappy with a professor will take the time to submit a rating.  (Any one who teaches will always get a few of these...) Further, many students confuse how easy a class is and how well they do in it with quality.  They don't care if they learned anything.  There criteria for a good professor is 1.  did I have to work hard and 2. did I get an A.  I think this site could be beneficial to professors.  If you are teaching, go ahead and grade yourself.   HARD.  Write that the course is a lot of work and that you only got a B-.  Do this a dozen times with different writing styles.  Also, do it at different times from different computers so it is harder for the RateMyProfessors people to figure out the same person is doing the rating.  If you are lucky, the lazy students looking for an easy course will see your fake ratings and avoid your course! That will make life easier for you.

Walker and it was presented at the Library and Information Association of South Africa annual conference, 1999.  From the site:  In the beginning was: the library talk and tour;. the a-v programme with exciting music; the computer demo of the OPAC; the library instructional leaflet; the colour-coded DIY leaflet tour of the library; the tape-guided DIY tour. We have had Readers Advisers, BI (bibliographic instruction), User Education, Reference or Information Skills, Information Literacy.  Underpinning all of these activities and programmes has been implicit the bottom line of understanding the structure and operation of libraries \u2013 all libraries. The catalogue, the call or shelf number, the subject index, the differentiated and specialised material formats and locations and services, we assumed were almost self evident, certainly in the broad perspective. What we were really saying was that we took for granted that our users expectations and experience more or less matched the structures we have been building and elaborating for decades.  With few exceptions, students entering university have never confronted such complex information resources, in print, audio-visual and electronic formats. They may be basically computer literate but are unlikely to have an extensive understanding of the purpose and possibilities of a computerised library system of catalogues, call numbers, databases and the Internet. Being able to use an ATM is not, as suggested from time to time, an adequate preparation for using electronic resources, not even in the 'one stop shop' approach. The extremely basic level at which students are introduced to the library\u2019s facilities comes as a shock to many professional librarians and academics, and it has even been suggested that this may be insulting. But our users, or would-be users, do not very often have the knowledge, experience or expectations we think they do and what we see in SA, though an acute case, is common to much of the rest of the library providing world. As organised religion has done to retain dwindling congregations, so we have gone through many exercises to increase 'user friendliness' and perhaps it is true to suggest that user friendliness has become subconsciously synonymous with democratic access, the antithesis of the 'elitist' LIS systems of the old regime. Perhaps the greatest challenge to us in opening the world of information access to those previously excluded, is to steer this narrow course between the Scylla of assuming very little understanding and the Charybdis of information overkill.   This paper describes and questions the starting point of some of our practical attempts to enable the student to launch himself into the exploration of the information universe he may scarcely know exists. Since preparing the abstract on which this paper was to be presented, I have encountered in a small academic discussion group some further questioning of a seemingly 'directionist' and 'mechanistic' approach \u2013 one might call it utilitarian - that epitomises most user education in higher education libraries."], "gold_label": 1.0}

who is steven carell?). it was just thin. i got a little irritated during the jack black cameo, not so much about the cruelty to animals, which i actually -- surprisingly -- laughed at, but because the woman behind us brought three ten-year-olds to the movie, all of which started to cry at that point. after the movie, there was more racquetball and some swimming, then a pizza arrived, and afterward the boy left. and then i worked this josh groban bs, and now i'll probably go to bed. lame. the best part is, i get to skip work on  monday . i might get a manicure before attending the first ever bimonthly Girls Poker Night, where all the attendees dress up like celebrities. i'm going as jlo, so i'm thinking a manicure and a big fake diamond are a must.  p.s. here is something i don't understand: street vendors selling purses. are they stolen purses?

If you could pick out qualities and piece them together to create your soul mate, what qualities would she posess?    Intelligence, conversability, and humor... are qualities that I dig. I could never be with someone who I thought was dumb, couldn't handle conversations, and joke around. In terms of soul mate? I'd like to believe that there is such a thing, and if there is such a thing... she would be herself and not someone I create from my imagination. Expectations can be a great source of disappointment.    2. If you could be extremely wealthy for the rest of your life, and never have to worry about money ever again, but it meant you'd have to give up the life you were living now (i.e. change where you live, where you go to school, your family and friends), would you?    No. To a certain extent, I know what it's like to pick up and move far away from my friends and family to a totally unfamiliar environment. Indeed the money would keep me from being bored as I am here in Binghamton, but I owe so much to those close to me. (Correction... I haven't been that bored lately... tonight breaks with the recent trend)    3. If you could spend one day with one person from the past (someone dead), the present (someone alive now) and the future (someone who is not alive yet, i.e. future children, 90th president), who would you chose and why?    I'd chose one of my friends, because it's a sure thing that it'll be a good time. I'd probably want to hang with Brandon, Andy, George, Esther, or Melissa.     4. If you found out that you only had one month to live, how would you spend those 30 days? What would you do differently?    I would go to a lot of concerts, and museums... to understand my own humanity. I would spend time with the people I care about and tell them how important they are to me.    5.

Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.

Meat:  its murder, yos.  I also cannot stomach the coconut.  I wont eat it.  Period.  Coconut flavor I like, the coconut itself, I cannot abide.  Add artificial vanilla or any syrup besides real maple syrup.  Also, I need real whipped cream, not Cool Whip.  Thanks.    3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   I would say Brittany Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Julia Roberts.  Let me hasten to add that I dont think they are homely, I just dont get why everyone goes coo coo for cocoa puffs over them.      4.

I like going out to interesting and different films and concerts, but I can never ever find anybody that wants to go. It can get a little frustrating. I don't mind spending time by myself, but sometimes it really gets to me. And I don't want to slum it and just do regular things, every time I do it feels like I'm selling out. Sometimes I feel like an elitist. I hope that's not true of me, it's not who I want to be. I think I need to take a long, hard look at that. So I have two tickets to the David Byrne concert tomorrow night and, so far, only myself going. I can't even begin to tell you how many times this has happened. It sucks because now the concert is looming over my head instead of being something that I'm anticipating and something that should be fun.   'Last night ... I ... fell asleep watching  Black Narcissus . Uneventful but par for the course.'  Last night was pretty regular. I went home and read a few articles in the Weekly Standard then made some dinner (which is going better than usual). Then I was wandering around Barnes & Noble not really knowing what to look for. I walked around for about 20 minutes and didn't get anything. I went home and fell asleep watching  Black Narcissus . Uneventful but par for the course.

That was one of the finest works of television drama I have ever seen.

The only bad point was the character of 'Soon Lee', since the actress that portrayed her did it with a Japanese accent.  Understandable, since Americans then (or now) wouldn't be able to tell the difference, but it was a little annoying as is.  As for the actress, she was Keiko from Star Trek Enterprise/Deep Space Nine, wife of character Miles O'Brian, and she was in the Joy Luck Club.  Today was another low point in my life.  Just one of those really hard days to get through.  MASH was a good escape, but it wasn't that much of one because many of the themes reminded me of what things have stormed my consciousness of late: nervous breakdowns, transitions, failure, close friendships, saying goodbye, etc.  Just one more day.

He cannot bust a move (see photo, above:  nuff said about Duf).  He is not a vegetarian, a unitarian or uber-liberal.  He went to a private university and not the best land grant University in the world.  He drives an American car and talks to his parents more than once a month.  He has had a colonoscopy.  He has never had a one night stand with buxom twins, nor has he won an award for BMX trick riding.   Anyway, I was walking down the hall with HB, and on my way back to my desk Jan says to me, she says:  'You two are a lot a like.'  That, my friends is superficial thinking at its shallowest.

After checking in to a dive hotel (with three small beds, no air and a faulty circuit breaker that killed all but one light), we headed out looking for people from ASA that my friend knew. First we went to Papas and Beer, a famous club that you might have seen bumper stickers for. We met no one there, so we headed to the Rocking Taco, where we found a large group of ASA members. After some drinks and mingling, we headed back to Papas and Beer which now was packed with partiers. After some food and more drinks, we headed back to the hotel where we didn't sleep much due to music from the hotel bar, which finally stopped around 3 AM.

I felt like I was going crazy. I apparently have a  need  to be able to check my email, etc... on a regular basis. I can finally admit it....i am addicted.

During my little  urlLink Ebay  phase, I was so hooked I would set a timer to make sure I was online when an auction was about to expire.  It's funny, because I honestly don't know if I can imagine my life right now without constant access to the net. Life without the net. You would honestly think that I've had the internet forever. The truth is the internet has only been in my life and the lives of many others for the last 7 - 8 years. However, we've all become so dependent on it that you would never actually know that. I don't even make long distance calls anymore, I talk to my fam overseas through Msn Messenger or icq or just plain ole email. Who mails a letter in this day and age?? If I have to send a document, I scan it...attach it...and click send.....  Sad but true, the blackout this past summer showed me how dependent the world has become on technology. We've forgotten how to do simple tasks without the assistance of a computer or some other sort of technology. I remember trying to call a few of my friends to make sure they were doing okay during the blackout and couldn't get in touch with them. When I finally contacted them once power had been restored, they shamefully admitted that they only had cordless/portable phones in their home and all of these phones couldn't work without electricity.   I also remember going for a walk with my mom and stopping at a neighbor's' house and telling them how we had drank tea and made soup. They couldn't understand how we had done that when we didn't have electricity and were so astonished when we let them know that we had just put a pan on the barbecue and boiled water the old fashioned way. My neighbor (and this ain't no lie) told me that she had thought of that but wasn't totally sure how to heat up the water that way!!!!!!!!!!  ...are we out of touch??? I can admit that to some extent I am...I can not imagine my life without the internet, my cell phone, a car, and other luxuries. However, I'm confident that if they were all stripped away tomorrow, I could and would survive. Unfortunately, there are a large group of people who definitely would have a difficult time living without all of our technological luxuries.   ...rotating...

'Films like 'The Chronicles of Riddick' gather about them cadres of fans who obsess about every smallest detail, but somehow I don't think 'Riddick' will make as many converts as 'The Matrix.' In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on 'an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life.' I observed that 'LOTR' fans should 'get a life.' I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe 'LOTR' has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on 'Riddick,' in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate.'"], "gold_label": 1.0}

The easy-to-reproduce syptom was that I could send veryshort mail (where the message all fit into one TCP packet) but could not send longer messages. Using tcpdump, I couldsee that the second packet of the message was simply not going through. When I switched to Ethernet, it worked fine.And, after I fixed my Airport, that worked fine. I hope no one followed my earlier message about using the WAP11. If so, I apologize. I'll leave in my previous note about using WEP passwords from OS X with non-Airport base stations.]] You will find a horrible gotcha in OS X that is unrelated to theLinksys box. In the Network system pref, to enter an ASCII passwordfor a non-Airport base station, you have to surround it withquotation marks even though you don't use them for Airportbase stations.

(is that the movie?)  it was pretty cool...it's nice to see a change!  =)  so, today, andy and i were supposed to buy a few frames for our house @ ikea.  at the end, we decided not to---$ave money!  we met up with andy's friend's at chili's for dinner before our movie--(matrix) started.  well, if you ask me, i'm not a big fan of the matrix.  actually, i've never watched matrix 1, 2, or 3.  but i still decided to go just to go out with the gang.  so, andy and joey decided to go to the car to put our left over food away while we already go to the theater.  so, we wait for awhile.  and finally they get there.  they took awhile because they ran into a few friends--melinda and ronald.  we're also close friends with them and didn't even know they were going out to a movie.  they were gonna watch love actually.  apparently, ronald didn't really wanna watch love actually and would rather watch the matrix.  so, what do ya know?  ronald and i just swapped ticket stubs.  ross and mary also joined us!  that movie was really good!  go watch it!  hehe.  by the time we got out of watching love actually, andy and ronald have been waiting for about 45 minutes!  poor babies.  they were actually kinda disappointed in the matrix...but do i care?  hehe.    there seems to be a lot of events for tomorrow!!  in the morning, my mom wants me and andy to take her to LA.  since i'll be there, i wanted to just check out if they have any nice shoes for the wedding that's coming up.  after that, we gotta go to a birthday party for my nephew.  after that, there's another party for my auntie and uncle (a retirement party and a birthday party), and now, we just got a message on our machine saying it's andy's little neice's birthday and they're having a surprise birthday party!  i don't know how old she'll be (5 years old?) but it's so cute to just imagine having a surprise party for a little girl!  hehe.  i hope we can pack all this in for tomorrow.  oh yeah, i also want to go to pala.  =)\n\nText 2:I'm back from my busy weekend! =)   Saturday:  On Saturday morning, my brother called telling us that they're in the hospital & asked if we can get there soon because Mel was already dilated at 9 sonometers (usually 10 sonometers is when birth occurs). So, I had to get ready really fast.  Andy was walking Coach so that kind of held us back.  Luckily, I had everything that I needed to take (baby's clothes, gifts, camera, etc.) ready the night before so all we had to do was take a shower, get ready, and leave!  On our way to the hospital, I called Grace because her son was having a party and I was supposed to be there early to help out.  I just told her that I probably wont make it but that I'll try! When we got to the hospital, my parents, Justin, Kayla, & their parents, and Mel's mom and brother were already there! My cousin ended up staying in the delivery room to help out since she's a nurse that delivers babies!  From what I hear, Mel was so thankful to have her there because she just helped make things easier.  Otherwise, she probably would've killed my brother.  Hehe.  So, they had a baby girl.  Mel said she honestly thought she was having a boy! They named her Maya. She was born at 10:44am weighing 6 lbs 12 oz. and is 20 inches.  Mel asked if I wanted to hold her, so I did.  I was kind of scared at first but I did hold her.  I held her a few times and I was playing with my mom because I wouldn't give Maya to her.  Hehe.    Anyway, we decided to leave the hospital to give the new parents some rest. We had to run some errands for my brother and after that, we decided to go to Gavin's birthday party! It was cool to hang out with my friends.  Poor Gavin was sick so he didn't look happy.  There was a clown that looked so creapy and had a bad accent.  She was talking to the kids and at times, it seemed like they weren't paying attention! The clown even asked, 'Hey, do you hear me?' Haha. It was funny.  She did a bad job with painting faces and making those balloon animals.  I don't know how they ended up with that clown!  Oh well. =) We pretty much stayed there until they were putting the tables away.  Grace's dad gave me so much cake...supposedly for me and my dad!  (my dad and Grace's dad are friends too). The party had a sports theme....and it was pretty much LAKER'd out! So, Grace gave me a few purple and yellow balloons to bring to the hospital! =)    After the party, we went to the store to buy some flowers and one of those 'it's a girl' mylar balloons.  We went back to the hospital to drop it off but they didn't let us take in the purple/yellow balloons because they were latex! Oh well.    Sunday:  We stopped by the hospital (again) for about 30 minutes. We dropped off those miniature hershey chocolates because I made a 'birth announcement' label for the candies! Apparently, it was a big hit because the grandparents are asking me to make more. After our short visit, we headed over to BJ's in Cerritos for Andy's cousins' graduation party! That place was pretty cool! It was huge! So, we stayed there for a while.  After that, I think we went to the hospital again.  We try to stay there in 30 minute increments because if you're there for    Monday: Maya's first day at home  We went over to Rod and Mel's house in Long Beach because some people were coming over and my dad was going to have a barbecue. We hung out there for a while.  I was feeling so bad for Melani and Maya. The baby was crying a lot and the grandmas were just trying to tell Melani what to do....things that she's not supposed to do. So, when cousin Maria (the nurse who delivers babies) came over, my brother was telling her to reinforce some of the things she should and shouldn't do. But did that work? NO! It's like the grandmas don't like to hear anything! Oh well. Poor Melani. If I were in Melani's position, I would probably be crying. Anyway, I helped clean everything up so we can all leave and let the new family get their rest. And that was that!"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Eat them with a lot of butter and your favorite jelly (I like strawberry), or with gravy, or creamed chipped beef, or whatever.  2 cups of flour a tablespoon baking powder  a teaspoon salt  a tablespoon sugar  about 1/3 cup shortening (maybe slightly more) about a cup of milk (maybe slightly less)       In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. A slotted spoon works fine.  Stir in the shortening, a little at a time, until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Don't be anal, but if you find any big lumps of shortening, squish them in better.  Gradually stir in milk until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. You might not need the whole cup, so try to make an executive decision.  At this point, the dough gets pretty hard to stir and you'll briefly wonder whether this shit is really worth it. It is.  Put the dough onto a floured surface (like, the countertop, dude) and work it LIGHTLY a couple of times with your hands so that the lump of dough seems to generally stay together. You need to learn, fucker, that kneading does not a tender biscuit make, so don't overdo it. It won't be completely smooth, but will be floury and sort of unkempt-looking. Get over it.    Pat or roll the dough out to approximately 1 inch thick.  Two or three rolls with the pin will get you where you want to go. This isn't rocket science. Cut biscuits out of the dough with a large cutter - at least 2' to 3' (bigger is always better, as you well know) or any large glass/plastic tumbler dipped in flour. Repeat until all dough is used. The more you work the dough, the less fluffy your biscuits will be, so the ones you cut at the end after re-rolling the dough a few times may not rise as high or be as fluffy as the first few. Do your best. They'll still taste good.  Brush off any excess flour and place biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet.   Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the oven that you preheated to 425 F or until they look golden brown enough for you. This is enough dough for six ex-large biscuits, if you do it right."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Very much so.\n\nText 2:Sounds like the faculty lounge not only just got computer hookups, but also recently got cable.  The folks around this place are rediculously excited because they can watch soap operas all day.  Fun for about an hour, and then you must find something else to do.  Don't tell the English teacher that, because she may actually bite your head off.  I saw her do this to someone yesterday.  Yeah, so I promised an update on Wednesday, but the whole thing about the parents being gone for meetings was just a mistake on their part--as in, they didn't actually have meetings, but merely misread their stupid calendar.  Chances are that the next update from home might be extraordinarily late at night, or on the 21st or 22nd of the month because I  know  they'll be out of town one of those two nights.  Anyway, back to work stories.  There aren't many, because at the present time, my job is about as boring as can be.  Study Hall is excruciatingly uneventful (I'm also in the process of waiting for the students to get in here and sit down for an hour and a half of bored time).  Seriously, when we were in high school, we at least made study hall interesting.  We'd come up with elaborate plans to figure out how the hell to get out of the building without the study hall teacher noticing we were gone for an hour.  I was good at it.  A trustworthy face helps this effort.  Shit, all these students would have to do is put forth a good effort and I'd let them run around.  I could care less.  This particular study hall this afternoon is 8 seniors who have already got all the credits to graduate, not to mention they've been taking remote courses from a college nearby, so really, all they do in study hall is....study.  What's wrong with them?  Maybe they're just feeling me out for a while to see how I work (the stone-face tends to keep the kids on their toes, which I guess isn't a terrible thing) and how far I'll let them go before I reel them back in.  The fact that I nearly napped their first day in my presence should be an indication for them, but my guess is that the last person in my position was a bit more uptight than I am.  I've never met her, so maybe she was.  I have yet to be included on the gossip circuit from the faculty lounge, so I don't know much of anything about anyone around here at the moment.  As for the PE portion of my schedule, the designated unit we're on right now (as determined by the head fitness guy--he has a title.  He shouldn't) is basketball.  Three of the 15 kids in one of my sections are actually coordinated enough to dribble the ball.  The other section is mostly athletes (which makes me exceptionally happy--less teaching, more doing) so it's easier to just jump right into things.  I had the athletes this morning (they have the schedule set up this way for some reason--if they were smart, they'd put the athletes in the late class, because then they don't have to worry about changing before practice, and they also don't have to worry about missing tests for days that they have to leave early).  There's 9 kids in that class, so they need a spare to fill out a 5-on-5 game, so I get to play.  Which is great.  Gives me something to do.  The other section doesn't allow for much more than me pointing to give them an idea of how to do things, so there is less participation on my part.  Hopefully once track season gets started I'll be more excited about work, but a week into it, I'm getting bored already.  At least once practices start, I can spend the downtime (and there's a shitload of downtime) to figure out drills for each person on the team.  I'm already aware of a shining spot on the team (it's a fairly new program for the school, so the development has been slow), but I also was made aware that this girl's mother is the coach of everything (including the head coach of the track team), so I'll have to watch myself to not step on toes.  This coach woman doesn't teach at the school, and I'm not even certain she's aware that I was hired.  I've encountered this woman in the past.  She was an assistant volleyball coach when I was in middle school.  She didn't like me then, and I can't imagine her thoughts have changed all that much.  I guess we'll see.  I should go make sure everyone is present and accounted for (they are, I can see they're all here).  Maybe I'll run to the library and find something to read."], "gold_label": 0.0}

ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Walz, Garry R. and Jeanne C. Bleuer.  It looks at scientific research as it relates to counseling.  From the ERIC Digest:  A core component of many new educational programs funded under Bush administration's No Child Be Left Behind Act of 2001 is that they be based on scientifically based research. Further emphasizing the important role that this type of research will play in future U.S. Department of Education priorities has been the establishment of the What Works Clearinghouse. Under the leadership of Dr. Grover Whitehurst, this new clearinghouse will '...establish standards for research and then determine...which studies meet those standards' (Taub, 2002).    Like others in the educational community, counselors and counseling researchers welcome the opportunity to empirically test the validity of their practices and then, just as important, demonstrate that what they do makes a positive difference in students' lives. But they also have many concerns about the practical feasibility of implementing scientifically based studies. The purpose of this Digest is to provide an overview of the characteristics of scientifically based research, compare it to other types of research, and address some of the challenges and issues that are particularly relevant to conducting scientifically based studies of counseling interventions. To accomplish this, the authors have included selected portions of the ERIC/CASS publication, Research in Counseling & Therapy (Loesch & Vacc, 1997).\n\nText 2:urlLink Ambientes de lenguaje y alfabetizacion en programas preescolares.

Not only was this going to be an important networking experience, but I was also going to be inducted onto the board of directorsso I had to be on my best behavior.  However, theres one detail Im leaving out here  the event involved  wine tasting .  I was doomed.  I started drinking a nice white wineand it was going down way too easy.  I was greeting people as they came inDont worry though  I wasnt using my Country Bar technique.  No one was getting his/her chest strokedbut I was getting pretty chatty, especially when I met some people who could potentially get me a job.  I met a guy who worked in Orbitzs marketing department and talked to him for a while.  More wine was tasted.  I then talked to the Dean for a while, but at that point I remember telling myself Panda, keep your shit together.  Just smile and nod.  Dont say anything stupid.  By the time the wine class was supposed to start, everyone was lit.  The poor lady who was supposed to teach us about all the wines hated us.  We were all talking (very loudly) during her entire presentation.  (Mental note: at the next event dont let the attendees DRINK before the presentation.)  We had more wine, and more wine, and well, you get the idea.  The event ended at 8pm, but of course that was  way too early  for me to go homeso I suggested to my friends (at that point, EVERYONE was my friend) that we stay and buy some more drinks.  The Orbitz guy and I were pretty tight by then.  I thought I was definitely going to get a job offer from thisuntil I realized he just wanted to get into my pants.  Do you want to go out sometime?  I think youre really cute.  Wait, I thought I was networking.  Instead, me talking to him was mistaken for flirting.  The good news is that within only a few days Ive found potential job prospects (at Target and Orbitz), but the bad news is I have to date these guys first.  Fuck me.  I shared a cab with the Orbitz guy (would you believe he lives down the street from me  in IANs buildingJesus) and right when I got into my place he called.  I could tell you were into me at the eventblah, blah, blah.  Sorry, friend.  All I wanted was your business card.\n\nText 2:Pandyland will be 1 year old on August 16th.

Just when I think people can't suck any more than they do, they go and surprise me.  Now that may be an unfair generalization, and I'm trying to rid myself of those, but at this point, when 3 people in your life don't suck and everyone else does, I think the generalization is fair.  I found something out tonight.  Fifth or Sixth hand.  From someone I detest.  If she didn't have proof, I wouldn't have believed it to be true, but there it was.  Concrete, incriminating, blood-boiling proof.  Proof that another person (and another group of people that are associated with this person) are just no longer worth my time.  The fact that the incident in question (at least the proof I have) is more than two months old is even more bothersome.   This person had the nerve to say to me very recently that we never talk anymore.  Well, at the time it was because I felt like I was out of the loop and didn't feel connected to her anymore because she never made it seem that anything I said was even the least bit important.  She also NEVER initiated a conversation.  It's not my job to start a conversation with everyone all the time.  It seemed like she had a new group of people to talk to and I was disposable.  That and I didn't tell her what she wanted to hear all the time.  I find this quality in people to be patronizing, and I refuse to be a part of it.   Well, now I have more reason to not talk to her anymore.  She had the nerve (or maybe it's cowardice, I don't know) to talk about me behind my back, and even used the term 'stupid' more than once.  Now, that's fine, go ahead and call me stupid.  I'll be the first to admit that I do dumb things.  It's part of being human.  But the reason she called me stupid?  Because of something I said on this here site that SHE and other people misinterpreted.  Now, these other people misinterpreted most likely because they choose to see me as this evil person who spends all of her time hating every little thing they do and trash talking them every hour of the day.  Except, you see, I have a life (and you've read about bits and pieces of it here).  Now, I have no idea how or why she missinterpreted this entry, but she did.  Fine.  No, that's fine.  It is.  But the fact that she didn't bother asking me about it is what pisses me off.  In no way did the entry say anything about her at all (and that wasn't the part that was messed up in translation), but she chose to take these other people's word that what I did was wrong.   Now, listen, I've said some not-so-tactful things, and I'm the first to admit that when I'm enraged enough, I post first, think later.  Look at most of the shit I've written in August alone.  This was not one of those instances.  This was a simple case of her not bothering to get clarification.   It's not my fault that the other people misinterpreted.  It's not my fault that she agreed with them.  It's also not my fault that she chose to let other people know her interpretation of my thoughts and they formed an image of me that isn't accurate or fair to me.    It does explain a few things, though.  The fact that I had reason to be paranoid when everyone assured me I didn't.  Looks like I'm not crazy after all.  Okay, I probably am, but this no longer gives solid evidence supporting it.   I just want people to remember this.  Remember that when you go talking shit about me behind my back, realize that somehow I always find out.  It always gets back around to me.  Always.  I'm not saying that you have to stop talking shit about me (and I'm certainly not going to stop talking shit about other people that piss me off), but just be more careful in who you're talking to.  Maybe you can't trust them.  I have a hard time trusting anyone right now.  Now, I would assume, there is someone else out there having some trust issues as well.  Welcome.

For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.  So it was with the most wonderful sense of irony and wonderment at how Life can sometimes work out that I found myself yesterday driving a candy apple red Camero convertable down the Nimitz Highway toward my hotel on Waikiki Beach on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.  If someone has a place to post them, I'll send pictures of Pearl Harbor when I go.  Happy New Year to all.   P.S.

(fyi, if the universe was a result of random events, cosmologists has calculated that there would be a 1 in 10^120 (10 to the power 120) chance that the universe came about.)   The Evil Argument:  'Look at the amount of evil polluting our World today, If there is a God out there, I'm sure he would stop all of this..............so, There really is no God........'   (btw, some words I use may be abit too technical, go to www.dictionary.com . If there are any words in which you do not understand.)  Ok, now that we have established what is the Design and Evil argument, I'll start my essay.   Two opposing camps caught in a philosophical deadlock. That is basically the case for Theists and Atheists today. Ideologically on polar opposites, the \u201cchampions\u201d of their ideologies, the most formidable weapons used, just like David and Goliath, with an outcome yet to be decided, is the design argument and evil argument respectively.   The design argument is by far the strongest, most logical and arguably the simplest argument for the existence of a God. Cosmologically speaking, the very presence of life on this Earth, if it was a result of random reactions and events, as affirmed by certain atheists, it would be near impossible (I never believe in such a thing as total impossibility) to justify the sustenance and existence of life on this very universe and planet throughout the course of history. To bring it closer to out planet, examples such as the nitrogen, water cycle as well as the many eco-systems in our planet today, showcases a near perfect design of our Earth.  However, along comes Goliath, the evil argument, that is. Just when David thought he has defeated the Philistines, Goliath crept into his tent and challenged him to a duel. In my opinion, the evil argument, has been the most hotly debated between both camps, due to its almost entirely philosophical nature, without any reference to science whatsoever, as compared to the design argument. Due to the philosophical nature of this argument, it is never difficult to come up with a counter-argument, any counter argument. But the thing is whether that particular counter-argument is logical, coherent and conclusive. Below is a common counter-argument used by theists, used by Christians especially, I\u2019ll refute that\u2026\u2026\u2026. (I\u2019ll defect for a little while).  \u201cGod gave us free will, he did not make us into robots who obey every single command he gives us, God does not want the human race to be like that, and thus, with free will, evil would start to creep in. Besides, the same gravity which keeps us on our feet, is gravity which causes people to fall to their deaths\u2026\u2026..\u201d  What do I think of this particular counter-argument? A Total contradiction to the design argument, in my opinion, say we assume God to be perfect (don\u2019t ask me what if He\u2019s not, its tiring enough to formulate a hypothesis based on this one assumption alone, maybe I\u2019ll come to that some other time\u2026\u2026..). Say God has perfect wisdom and intelligence, as shown in the intricate and expert design of our universe and planet. I do not think that God, in all his (generally speaking) omniscience would have any problem designing free will which would not let the problem of evil exist, and neither would he have any problem designing a type of gravity which would keep us glued to this Earth but yet prevent us from falling to our death. Moreover, the design argument has already shown the existence of such a God.  Now, what will be my counter-argument then? It can be summarized into \u201cwhat really is good, what really is evil?\u201d The essence of my counter-argument is that good and evil has to exist hand in hand and good and evil mainly exists hand in hand. This is a counter-argument used mainly by theist philosophers without any specific religious affiliations whatsoever.  Firstly, every quantity is relative. Before the nature of its magnitude can be determined (e.g. Long, short, big, small), there has to be a yardstick, a point of reference, in which it has to be measured. Take one week for example, a quantity of time, we can never brand it as a long or short period of time, unless we measure it against something. 1 week for the completion of a building? 1 week for your toenails to grow 1 cm? 1 week for light to travel 5 kilometers? Only when we measure a quantity against a yardstick, can we say \u201cwhoa, that\u2019s fast\u2026\u2026\u201d or \u201cwah lau eh\u2026\u2026..why so slow sia\u2026?\u201dWell, in the context of the evil argument, the yardstick for evil is good, and for good, it is evil. Still unconvinced? Read on\u2026\u2026  Imagine you\u2019re in your kitchen and there on your kitchen table sits a bowl of sugar. (btw, this sugar analogy is borrowed from Nietzsche\u2019s good friend, who was also a philosopher when Nietzsche was in his 20s, can\u2019t remember his name though\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.). This sugar is only sweet when it touches the tip of your tongue, and sends a signal to your brain saying \u201csweet\u201d. But take that you\u2019re a person with a sweet tooth. Will you be saying \u201cmeh\u2026\u2026..lousy sugar\u2026\u2026it\u2019s not even sweet!\u201d But take it you\u2019re born a diabetic who has eaten everything bitter, sour, spicy but never sweet, would be saying \u201cwonderful! I\u2019ve not tasted anything so sweet in my entire life!\u201d In this analogy, what is the yardstick in which to measure sweetness? In the sweet tooth\u2019s case, it is his constant exposure and experience with all things sweet. As for the diabetic, his yardstick is the bitterness and sourness he has tasted in this entire life. From here, we can see that the same sugar with supposedly the same sweetness, can be both sweet and bland at the same time.  The same goes for the evil argument. 1 act can be either called \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cevil\u201d or \u201cmeh\u2026.nothing special\u2026.\u201d. Depending on the yardstick in which it is measured. Take the act of helping up someone who has fell down, it may be a good deed no doubt.  But say, someone who has fell down on the pavement in a park and you helped him up, and compare this to you helping someone up in a time of war, with enemy soldiers hot on your heels\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.which one of the following acts has more \u201cgood\u201d in it? Indeed, evil is amplified in an atmosphere of good and good is amplified in the atmosphere of evil.  In my opinion, there are no absolutes in life, good and evil is simply a matter of perception. What we define as good and evil, we measure it with a yardstick, a yardstick of social norms, our upbringing and/or our religion. There is never such a thing as true objectivity as reflected in sociology and the study of social sciences. We never look at any one issue with our naked eyes. We look at it through the lenses of our society, religion etc. which invariably distorts the image. Good and evil is a point marker in a very big field, this point marker is ever-changing, what is evil today may not be evil 2000 years down the road and vice versa.  Which leads to my belief in yin and yang, what constitutes yin and yang of course, is variable. But to put it in the most general definition, yin and yang represents the co-existence of both positivism and negativity, and from this co-existence exists perfection. And you can say that I\u2019m somewhat a dualist, where this argument is concerned. The thing that I have with certain Christian beliefs is that sometimes, it focuses too much on the positive side. Where feelings is concerned, sadness and happiness have to co-exist, excessive sadness makes you suicidal, depressed, but excessive happiness makes you apathetic to people who are sad, and sometimes, cocky.  Sadness is perhaps the greatest inspiration for the best music and poetry ever composed. Feelings which we view as negative do have a positive impact on our life if applied the right way and released in the right manner. Many reforms, political, social, religious or otherwise, would not have taken place, if their founders were not angry with the current state of events. Anger, a negative emotion, has been harnessed and channeled to bring about positive changes and reforms to make the society in which we know of today.  In conclusion, I admit, my counter-argument is neither conclusive nor was it even meant to conclusive in the first place. But I hope someone can get a fresh perspective from this particular essay, and hopefully this can contribute in some way into a logical and conclusive counter-argument.

Other themes discussed in the articles include research, collaboration, the use of tutorials, tours, distance learning, active learning, problem-based learning, and the role of accreditation bodies.\n\nText 2:I have a new pet...&nbsp; I swear, my house must be the Open House for animals.&nbsp; I had JUST stepped out of my shower Sunday morning when something caught my eye... well, of course I didn't have my glasses on, so I was freaked for a minute until I got my fake eyes on... lo &amp; behold... a Gecko!&nbsp; He's a baby... about an inch from head to end of tail.&nbsp; He's soooo cute!&nbsp; So, today, I went to the pet store, got him a new home, bought him some crickets &amp; he's now living in the land of luxury.&nbsp; I fed him a cricket...

If U2 reproduced their 'Boy' sound over and over, it would get tedious after 20 years.  Radiohead has changed and evolved over the years too.  'Pablo Honey' sounds different from 'Hail to the Theif,' but you recognize both as Radiohead.  What Liz did is change  genres .  She went from alt rock to pop.  That is a huge change.  She went from the company of Patti Smith and PJ Harvey (artists) to the company of Avril Levigne and Christina Aguilera (marketers).  She has dumbed her lyrics down to the point that I don't even recognize her (compare the lyrics of F*** and Run from Exile in Guyville (with their capacity to surprise and educate) to the banal lyrics of H.W.C. (nothing but smut) on this new piece of trash CD and you will see what I mean.  Change is inevitable.  Degradation could be avoided.  If the hiatus left her with nothing to say, better to fall silent; I'm all for single mom's providing for their illegitimate children, but I also hate to see an artist become a marketer and Liz Phair used to be about something besides making money.\n\nText 2:urlLink     Ok, I'm easily amused, I'll admit that.  But I have this fondness for words, really odd words.  My favorite is ostentatious, though I'm not even sure I spelled it right.

Ok, ok.  Next is G.  Gargantuam.  Have you seen the size of Jeff Stryker's gargantuam member?  If not you should check it out, he has an action figure now (I'm not kidding).  Oh man a Q.  Hmm, let's see.  Damn, I need a dictionary. Quinessential.  A quinessential part of any betrayed woman's day should be throwing sharp (darts are good) instruments at a photo of 'the other woman'.  H is next.  Oooh Oooh I know.  If throwing sharp instruments at the before mentioned photo evolves into mailing slightly aerated speciman to the other woman, it may be considered harrassment.  H is for Harrassment.  I got an O!!  How lucky is that.  Of course it would be ostentatious of me to state (no matter how true) that I simply ooze luck and ability, and made it happen.  Wainscotting.  Never mind.  After a brief discussion my husband and I can't elaborate on wainscotting other than to say we think it's a type of trim.  Of course by saying that I guessed I used it in a sentence, huh?    It's that ability..hehe  ok, next!!  P, P is for polyamorous.  Do you know what that means? If not, don't try it.  Being in a polyamorous relationship can cause major headaches when one woman falls in love with her boyfriend's wife's boyfriend.    Ok, last is L!

I am out of cash at PokerStars but I do have quite a few FPPs (Frequent Player Points) there. I entered a satellite to their World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP).  This was a limit tourney with 290 entrants and 9 advancing to the super-satellite.  Each level is 15 mins long and we started with T1500. In Levels 1 & 2, I only saw the flop 4 times, two of those in the BB, and I folded on the flop every time.  Level 3 (50/100) brings me AQo in the BB, by the time the action gets back to me, the betting is capped so I fold. Don't know if that was really the right move, but felt that it was still early in the tourney and that I could pick a better spot.  Turns out that I would have missed every street and the pot winner had pocket kings, flopping a set and turning quads. One player called all the way with 98s.  Not alot of play for me up to this point, but Level 4 (100/200) brings me some action. My first hand, I get 66 UTG. I call the $100 BB but when it comes back around it's $190 to me with two players all-in. The flop comes 6AA giving me a full house. Of course I bet out, get one caller (plus the 2 all-ins) and the turn brings a 3. I bet, the caller folds. I'm screaming 'No pair, no pair!' but you know what comes: a 3 on the river!! My FH loses to one of the all-ins holding AJo. I win a $200 side pot and I'm down to T850. Crap. I win a couple of small pots and am at T1045 when 88 show up in middle position. There's a raise and RR when it gets to me and I call bringing a RR behind me. Shit.  I call. 4 of us take the flop which brings a sweet 8T8!! Quads, baby!! The four of us cap the flop and see a K come on the turn. Again everyone sees the river card with 2 of us all-in. A third spade comes. At the showdown, two players were holding AK, one rivered their flush and I smacked them all with quads. A pot of T4330 is pushed my way and I'm out of the hole!! I fold my way thru the rest of this level.  Played only one hand in Level 5 (150/300) picking up T675 with 66 UTG. At the break I sit with T4930 which puts me 21 out of 155. Level 6 is very uneventful. I pay to see the flop a few times then folding.  Level 7 (300/600)I finally get a premium hand. AA and I end up going all-in. They hold up for a nice T6767 win. My tight image allowed me to pick up a couple of small pots of T1200 and I'm over T8000.  Not getting any hands I think I start to get impatient and try to buy a couple of pots at Level 8(400/800) but wasn't successful and am bleeding off some of my chips. I drop nearly my whole stack when I call the BB with KTc and see a flop 37T. There's a bet, I raise and get 2 callers. Turn pairs the 3 and I bet out and again get 2 callers. The river is an 8, there's a bet, I call and am raised. Shit! I know I'm beat but there is too much money for me to fold, I call the extra T800 and get shown two pair, tens and eights. I had it until the river! The worst feeling. I'm hurting with only T467 left.  I win a couple of pots putting me up to T4203 when I go stupid!!!!   I raise to T800 UTG with 33(?!?!) One caller and the flop brings 6KT (ALL CLUBS/HIGH CARDS MOJO!!!) I bet, am RAISED and I call(?!?!) Turn: he bets, I call. River: he bets, I'm all-in. Showdown: Mojo702: shows [3s 3h] (a pair of Threes)           kyocera: shows [9c 7c] (a flush, King high)  All she wrote. I finished 38th of 290. Respectable but a stupid way to go out.

It was such a dampener for the moment... it's also Jimmy's birthday, you know?  We stopped by Grey's Papaya to pick up some hot dogs (mustard and sauerkraut yum!), and had some interesting conversations about ministries... about the issue of authority, and how all of the problems in church history always stem from the issue of authority:  who has it?  Where is it?  Problems arise when leaders try to assume too much authority over the members of the church, instead of directing them to the Scriptures.  Well, I can go more into that, but I don't remember enough to explain... but it definitely makes sense, if you think about it.  After we slept, I drove back home the next morning.  I rested a little, then tried to go to my roommates' church's picnic, got lost, and had to go back home because I was getting picked up for the Steven Curtis Chapman concert in Philly.  We met up with some people, got cheesesteaks @ Tony Luke's (2nd best in city, supposedly... I thought it was realllly good), and went to the concert.  It was in Temple University's Gymnasium... I met up with the Hopkins crew.  So awesome.  Jane Park had also come from Chicago; she had a ticket to come to NY this weekend, so she spent time with Brian.  They both came, and that was a pleasant surprise.  The concert was just incredible, I'll write more later. Too tired right now.

Essentially, the Bible says to find your joy in worshipping God.  I think this is radically different than any worldly philosophy, because in one form or another most pretty much say, find your joy in worshipping yourself, others, or any element of the universe.  Acetic routines point to ourselves as the source of our joy, at the end, because they say, 'You will  earn  your joy by living up to this standard.'  Humanistic ideals say to find your joy in loving others, which sounds good to some degree, because it comes close to the realization that we only find real joy in praising and loving something outside of us.  However, if you look at the big picture, the Bible says that we are to be for the praise of His glorious grace.  Where the humanistic ideals say to find your joy in loving others, God has made it known to us that the only way we can truly be joyous is to love Him with everything that we are made of.  This concept is distinctly different because the focus of our love is not on fallible, finite beings, it is on an infallible, infinite Being.  He sent His Son as a measure of love instead of wrath, so that we can find our utmost joy in giving all credit to Him.  I've learned this in my mind in the past, and it sounds great.  However, the trouble started when I tried to apply this by looking to myself again, and trying to force myself believe it with my life.  As a result, I have delved into deceiving, self-centered standards that have only resulted in frustration and depression.  On the outside, one might try to say, 'Oh, it's because the Gospel is wrong,'  but I realize that it was me that was wrong in the way I immediately misunderstood the Gospel, and looked to myself.  God has been teaching me more and more these days that life isn't under my control.  Proverbs 3:5-6 has become more clear to me:  I can't lean on my understanding of reality to even know and enjoy God, let alone get by in this world.  Loving God is another thing that I receive from Him, from asking, from trusting in Him with all my heart, from acknowledging Him in all my ways.  How liberating it is to find that the God most High is establishing your own love affair with Him; the pressure isn't on you!\n\nText 2:Q: Why is it harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God, than for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle?  A:  His heart is divided among his many possessions and distractions.  True heaven would be to love the Lord our God with all of our hearts, souls, and minds beyond all time.  But how could this promise be attractive to a person who has everything he or she wants here?  Christ's camel/needle illustration seems to be more profound than I realized; the needle eye has room for one single desire, while trying to fit a camel matches trying to fit exponentially larger amounts of desire for so many things.  Can we strip our periphery desires to say that God is truly our only one?  Can we have the strength to fast from God's blessings to be satisfied by knowing God alone?  If it hypothetically came down to it, would we rather pleasure in gourmet food, TV, movies, music, sex, alcohol, cars, romance, relationships and games than pleasuring in communion with God?  Do we really love God?  It's genius, it really is, that God made Himself imperceptible save for the written memories transmitted through the Bible.  Man would fall in love with the unthinkably glorious image transmitted through our eyes and ears and confuse it for truly loving God Himself.  It's like trying to get a dog to love you by giving him food; does he really love you as its master, or simply because your image means food delight for him?  Because God can't be perceived by our five senses, to obey and emotionally connect with Him Unseen, to trust the words of Someone imperceptible would mean there's a true love for God Himself.  It's a test of real love, isn't it?"], "gold_label": 1.0}

He walks like a gay man.  Not there's anything wrong with gay men, my best friend is gay (Hi Turtle!), but I figured since he's a 'man of god' and it's supposed to be a sin to be gay, he'd try to make sure he didn't 'appear gay'-whatever that is.  Ate at Rally's last night because 3 separate KFC's in the Akron/Cuyahoga Falls area were out of the 3 strip meals.  Fuckers.   Have to work tomorrow, goody.

It shall be fun.\n\nText 2:Brandi and I are still in the process of moving.&nbsp; When we first secured the new place it sounded like the transition period would be over a weekend, which would have made this a much smoother process.&nbsp; Doing it over the course of a work week isn't that big of a deal, but it does slow everything down.&nbsp; Spending over ten hours per day in getting ready for, going to, being at, and coming from work really gets in the way.&nbsp; That and my propensity to postpone work for PlayStation, of course.&nbsp; Also, Brandi works into the evenings, so we haven't been able to work together on it much since Sunday.   Still, we shouldn't have any trouble getting finished on time.&nbsp; Yesterday and today were and are big days in the process.&nbsp; For one thing, I unhooked, packed up, and moved my PlayStation yesterday, so I can't 'waste' time on it until the TV is moved.&nbsp; I also moved a fair amount of other stuff, and then Brandi and I went through and pulled a lot of clothes I can't/don't wear.&nbsp; She'll be taking those items to Goodwill at some point today.   Today the couch is being moved, and hopefully the television as well.&nbsp; I feel like a dumbass for having a moving company come to take my couch from the middle of the building to the end, but I didn't want to mess with it at all.&nbsp; It's a big couch, and it was a real pain to get it into the place.&nbsp; I'll gladly put it into the hands of the professionals.&nbsp; I think they'll probably move the TV as well, but it's not a problem if they don't get to it for some reason.&nbsp; The TV I have is big and awkward, but it would be easy enough to move with a hand from Brandi.&nbsp; After today the only thing that should be left in the old apartment is one computer, which I'm leaving there for the time being because&nbsp;we won't have internet access in the new place until Saturday.&nbsp; For that matter, I'm not thrilled about moving the television before then, but the only thing I've been watching cable TV for is Reds games, and they haven't been much fun to watch lately.&nbsp; If I miss a few it's no big deal, and this way I can hook up my PlayStation and get back to business as usual.  I didn't get quite as much done yesterday as I would have liked, but I did okay.&nbsp; I got a late start.&nbsp; Brandi called before I left work to ask a favor.&nbsp; She was teaching a yoga class&nbsp;in the&nbsp;evening but hadn't brought any music for it.&nbsp; This led me to Circuit City in search of a generic classical music CD.&nbsp; I found one in fairly short order, but no trip to Circuit City--even one with a specific purpose--is complete without a little browsing.&nbsp; This is usually dangerous, and yesterday was no exception.&nbsp; I left there with the CD I came for, and also with three DVDs:&nbsp;  Batman ,  Forrest Gump , and  South Park:&nbsp; Bigger, Longer, and Uncut  (my DVD page will be updated later today to reflect these additions to my collection).  At any rate, by the time I took that CD to Brandi at her place of employment, I ended up getting home about an hour later than usual.&nbsp; I did spend some quality time with my PlayStation at that point, and then put the Reds game on TV while I moved stuff.&nbsp; I got the living room pretty much emptied out and some other important items moved.&nbsp; I was still working when Brandi got home.  When she got home (close to 10:00 p.m.) we started talking about some stuff we'd like to do or have, and we ended up making a trip to Wal-Mart.&nbsp; We bought a DVD shelf and a new microwave (my old, enormous&nbsp;microwave will be making a one-way trip to Goodwill this afternoon).&nbsp; We had a late dinner when we got back, and then I built the shelf.&nbsp; I was hammering away at it near midnight, and that's one of the things I love about living in a college town--you can generally get away with stuff like that.  Then came the purge of my closet, during which I amused Brandi by trying on clothes which no longer fit.&nbsp; Those clothes are also making the one-way trip to Goodwill today, and I say good riddance to them.  I plan on moving just about everything that's left this evening after I get home from work.&nbsp; Hopefully then I can stop talking about this 'moving experience' and get back to whatever it is I normally ramble about."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I ate before starting this... but anyway... I got home from UCLA and the Herrick library. It's been a long day. I had stats at 9:30 AM, then stats lab, then a meeting with my professor for 192w. Then after going to the bank and getting gas, I went up to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Herrick library in Beverly Hills.  I can't believe someone checked out the  Blockade  script. I did manage to get some research done there. It was kind of cool there.

Let me just preface with this statement:  science takes a lot of intelligence, perserverance, and creativity.  It is very hard to do, let alone do well.  Science is not just a collection of facts and figures, but as well it is a highly developed construct of ideals and philosophies to plausibly understand how the world works.  So I'm not dissing science, or scientists (seeing as I'm studying to be one myself).  It saddens me, though, that the general public seems to view science and the scientists of the present day in the same way that people in the past viewed magicians and religious figureheads.  I get that notion from the way people generally reason that science is about 'cold and hard facts', that 'reason is above belief', etc. etc.  Because it takes a certain type of intellect to understand and do well in science, people view those who do it well as the end-all authorities on their subjects.  What they, and scientists fail to understand, is that science is still nothing more than a highly developed construct of ideals and philosophies created by man.  Albeit powerful, they are still merely what they are: descriptions and predictions and representations of reality, not reality itself.  When you boil everything down, you'll find that everything starts with assumptions.  To believe these assumptions to be comprehensive and true takes a bit of FAITH, and henceforth comes a main point:  every person cannot be 'fully rational' to the tee, because there is always a point where you can only have faith to say something is real.  Man can only manipulate and create images of reality; man cannot create reality itself.  And herein lies a really interesting truth, that we who are made in the image of God can only create images and manipulations.  Anyhow, so there you have it.

This ERIC Digest is by Jennifer Beller.  It reviews how sports can help to buold character.  From the ERIC Digest:  Sportsmanship and the development of positive character have long been explicit goals of school sports. A strong belief exists that sport programs have the power to promote the development of '...sportsmanlike behaviors, ethical decision-making skills, and a total curriculum for moral character development' (Stoll, 1995, p. 335) and provide a social environment to acquire personal and social values and behaviors contributing to good character and good citizenship (Arnold, 1984; Sage, 1998). The arena of sport can provide one of 'the greatest opportunities for a student to learn honesty, integrity... and ethical behavior' or it can provide 'one of the greatest opportunities in school for a youngster to learn how to be dishonest...or how to be hypocritical' (Sabock, 1985, p. 271). Little empirical research exists supporting that mere participation in and of itself leads to the development of moral character. In fact, the opposite appears true, that sport participation may be more likely to negatively affect moral character (Bredemeier, 1984; Priest, Krause, & Beach, 1999; Stoll & Beller, 2000). Whether positive or negative, '[s]ports have immense power to shape consciousness, values, and beliefs of athletes and to pass on selected aspects of the dominant culture' (Sage, 1998, p. 264). This digest discusses the formal and informal processes of moral character development, in light of the types of programs that have shown to improve moral character, sportsmanship, and fair play."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Now, before you gun nuts start wigging out and bemoaning the 2nd amendment, realize that this petition is not directly calling for the BAN of firearms.  Mainly, its concerns the 3 following issues:  1 Renew and strengthen the Assault Weapons Ban.  The NRA wants to put military style rapid-fire assault weapons that have been banned for ten years back on the street. We must tell Washington no way is this going to happen. The Assault Weapons Ban must be renewed and strengthened.     2 Keep the courthouse door open for victims of gun crimes.  The NRA wants to slam the courthouse door shut on victims of gun crimes by granting immunity for Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and other gun dealers. Bull's Eye armed the D.C. snipers and also sold guns used in 52 other crimes. If this happens, the families of victims of the DC snipers will have their suits against Bull's Eye thrown out of court. The dealer walks away scot-free.     3 Defend the Brady Bill - Repeal the Tiahrt Amendment.  Caving to NRA pressure, Congress recently passed a bill that will destroy records of all allowed firearm sales within 24 hours instead of the current 90-day law. It will also block the ATF from requiring gun dealers like Bull's Eye Shooter Supply (the dealer who armed the DC Snipers) to take regular inventories of their firearms.     Gun Violence is a uniquely American crisis that must be stopped.  The NRA are little more than a group of racist, redneck, ignorant hate-mongers hell-bent on arming themselves to the teeth in preparation for the 'invasion' of the blackies, commies, terrorists, vampires, martians or....whatever other ridiculous and completely non-existent threat they can come up with.

Basically, figured I'd get this out of my system now, before moving on to other things.  First, the joys of academic politics.  Give a quick glance at the following article (http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110004806) (yes, you will have to cut and paste, because I am a luddite....more on that later) from John Miller.  At least within the realm of political science (and even moreso in some of the humanities fields), those of us somewhat to the right ('Whataya mean 'somewhat,' Franco?' says the disembodied soul of Che Guiverra) do tend to find our professions to be somewhat alien realms.  It makes conferences fun: saying 'I supported the Iraq War' somehow changes in the air, so when your fellow professional hears it, the words are 'I sacrifice cute little kittens to the demonic forces of Lucifer-and-Cheney.'  The 'otherness' of it is bizarre, but keeps things interesting.  One other bit of venom on politics, that came to mind during one of my last bleem-hunts on yahoo some time ago.  On the various issues discussed, they had a pretty strong view of what was right.  And therefore, it was Constitutional.  Apparently, the mystical magical constitution promises all good things, so whatever one thinks is 'right' must be a Constitutional right.  This never ceases to amaze me.  If this is true, obviously we don't talk about the Constitution's origins correctly - you get the idea that it was a bunch of fellows conferencing with one other for stability's sake.  But, no, rather, it should be thus: 'And lo, down from the heights of clouded Mount Vernon came Madison, carrying upon his arms the two tablets, one called 'Constitution' and the other 'Bill of Rights.'  And Madison said to the people, 'Verily I say unto you, the Autonomy thy Self has written these tablets, and through these tablets all blessings be upon you.'  And the people rejoiced, and there was much cheering.'  The Constitution is not Sacred Scripture.  It is not the Bible, the Torah, the Koran....heck, it's not even the Rights of Man.  It is a social compact with disparate influences.  Not every good thing is covered.  Not every bad thing is covered either.  Something could be wonderful, and not protected.  Something could be dreadful, and not unconstitutional.  Hopefully, if the Constitution can be desacralized at some point, discussion about 'Constitutional' and 'Unconstitutional' can be more reasonable.  (Whew).  Okay, I feel better now.  On to other things.\n\nText 2:Well, it's been a couple days.  I promise I'm not slacking off.  My computer is having some....issues.  You see, its memory keeps filling up on the hard drive.

But every once in a while, I get this: 'Listen, I've been working on my paper comparing Plato and Aristotle, and I've got about three pages, and I've answered the question.  What should I do?'

Sure I got an ice cream treat and air conditioning but..Steve Martin?? He doesn't have the sperm capacity to father 12 children..there is a medical reason why he's got white hair...(he's been grey/white since the late 70's, there is something in his body that is keeping him from ageing past 50. I believe he is really 187 years old) When me and Been walked out we realised that it had been raining...so our sheets are wet. Yeah, what a fucking catastrophe! But you know...sleeping on a bare matress in sticky gross weather..with someone who is a grumpyguts (you know CB...what a grumpyguts..) it's just a living hell.  Hmm... I need to see a doctor, my body is throwing out everything toxic and it's not pretty. One cigarette today and perhaps I'll have one much later but there is no rush. CB is sick and not smoking (or so he says) and so is Been. Is this a health kick? A lot of people have been going on some crazy health kick..it's insane. Why is that?

Now, Eddie has been to Panama City, so he knows, but Panama City isn't exactly biker friendly.  That didn't stop me.  I rode on dirt roads beneath powerlines, along highway 98, and across back streets of Callaway, Parker, Springfield, Panama City, and Cedar Grove.  At one point, in the woods, I came to a 3 foot deep cut in the dirt road that would be impossible to ride across.  I had already ridden 5 miles down the soggy road and had no intentions of turning back.  So, regrettabley and very carefully, I threw my mountain bike across the six foot trough of water and lept after it.  It worked!  yeah!  Guys, it was a great feeling.  50 degrees today, overcast, and just a slight breeze.  Great great day to spend riding around.  Just wanted you know that Mungo's biking days are begining again!!

Poor leadership - they promote people too fast in many instances,and they promote guys who are the 'well rounded' vice the reallycapable (see my entry below).2.  The extraneous BS - there are a thousand and one requirements youhave imposed on you that detract from your actual job and duties. Goes back, in part, to the 'well rounded' concept, but much of it isjust standard military BS that has grown unchecked over the years. Take training, for example; one problem is that quantity is emphasizedover quality, and the quantity grows everytime someone up the chainsees what they perceive as a need or deficiency.  The result...theaverage submarine engineering department sailor attends 5-6 hours aweek of classroom-style training, this to do a job he spent 2 yearslearning in schools and another year doing under instruction on theship to qualify.  This is classroom training outside ofOJT/drills/practical learning.  And the administration of thesetraining programs takes the LPO and Division Officer a significant  amount of time each week.  This is at sea or inport.Then there is the cleaning - still under extraneous, because (again)of the amount.  We once calculated in an average week at sea that mostguys do 12-14 hours of cleaning (9-10 watches in a week with a 3section rotation, doing cleaning for one hour after each watch, plus a3-4 hour all-hands field day each week...and this doesn't include thetime you are supposed to dedicate on-watch to cleaning, which in myexperience was directed to be about 1/2 to 3/4 of a 6 hour watch).Throw in drills (1-3 a week in port, three to five drill periods withmultiple drills each at sea, more if an inspection is near) and youare looking at about 25-30 hours a week that is spent not doing yourprimary job...instead, it's training, cleaning, and drilling.Now, those things are necessary...but believe me, the amount of timededicated to them (which includes, in addition to the numbers above,more time for those who have to prepare the training, or the drills)is out of whack when you consider that, at least in port, there isusually a good 30 hours a week of solid in-rate work to be done(maintenance, testing, repair, ordering parts,scheduling/administrating the maintenance, etc.).  So, on aconservative estimate you spend, in port, 3 hours a week drilling, 5hours training, and 10 hours cleaning (an hour a day, plus a threehour field day, plus two more in a 'responsive' sense, at a minimum)and you have taken up 18 hours of the nominal 40 hour workweek.  Thisdoesn't include watchstanding (which eats up about 4-6 hours of theworkday every third day for all your sailors), the time spent ingoing/coming to/from all this training, and the time gettingout/putting away the cleaning gear and reinstalling the stuff you pullup to clean under.  Rough figure is about 20 hours a week doing stuffthat isn't addressing your workload.So when does the work get done...when do guys study for advancement(which the ship's training does woefully little to prepare you for, inmost cases)...when does the general military stuff (counseling, evals,preparing awards, PT, quarters, mentoring) get done?It doesn't, in a lot of cases.  Well, the work does (often rushed,done after hours when guys really want to be home, and thus doneshoddily).  The rest...well, it gets shoved to the wayside until it isneglected so long that it becomes a crisis.Oh, on top of all that...to make rate these days you have to be 'wellrounded', remember (see below).  So you have to have your collateralduties, your out-of-field qualifications, all that stuff.  When do youdo that?  Well, many spend significant amounts of their off-duty timedoing it (and if you aren't there in the 'off' hours you are deridedand considered a slacker), many others do it when they are supposed tobe working, thus foisting off their work on someone who never gets theopportunity to be 'well rounded'...as he's doing the work!3.  Taking care of our sailors isn't important anymore - sure, thereis lip service paid and plenty of programs out there, but commandsdon't  really  support people who need help.  Trust me, I've seenthis happen often enough to believe now that this is the norm ratherthan the exception.4.  The 'buddy system' - it's not just for overseas liberty.  This,sadly, has been around for as long as we've had a Navy, and I'm surewe aren't unique...but favoritism on the part of (or being dislikedby) one's seniors usually makes all the difference in yoursuccess...not your ability.  Same idea goes if you are in any kind oftrouble...if you are connected, you are safe.  If not (or if you arenot liked) you are screwed.  If you rock the boat and try to do theright thing (which often isn't the expedient route the ship/CO wants)you often are the target, and the scapegoat when a head needs to roll. (I've seen this firsthand on several occasions, as well).5.  Organization - or lack thereof.  For all our instructions, memos,policies, procedures, checklists and the like the Navy often is run ona crisis management 'chicken with it's head cut off' mentality.  Theamount of administrivia for nearly everything makes even the simplestof tasks (say ordering and replacing a light bulb) a chore that takes5 times longer than it would in your house...and kills two or threetrees for the paperwork in the process.6.  The 'forest for the trees' - meaning we often can't see it.  Inthe Navy, the 'big picture' is so often lost we have a term:  LOBP('loss of big picture'...alternately 'LOBF' for 'loss of big flick'). Sadly, the leadership gets caught up in this the worst...they who aresupposed to guide us through the forest get bogged down in climbingevery tree.7.  Job satisfaction - this is, of course, a personal issue for mostconcerned.  But I hear/see/personally experience the lack of jobsatisfaction all to much.  Innovation is becoming more and more rarein the era of 'if it's not in the book, it can't be done' mentality. There seems to be no real reward, and much of what we do is done outof 'it's always been this way' mentality or for no good or discernablereason.  How much satisfaction can one get from a job that no one(even the chiefs or senior leadership) knows the reason for, and thathas no clear purpose or need to be accomplished.That is, of course, my opinion...others may not agree.  But it's manyof these things (especially in regards to my last submarine and myobservations at my current command) that have driven me to the pointof deciding that I'm getting out.  The pay and more importantly thenature of the job aren't good enough anymore to put up withshortcomings that keep growing and piling on themselves.\n\nText 2:hey         im in such a great mood lately.  and yes there are reasons which i have yet to have the desire to disclose but i will later.  lets just say things are going really really well and im happy...            except hello dolly.  i hate it...i feel so pointless there....like seriously if i died no one would be like oh we cant do the show now. but w/e...im not doing the musical next year...i want to stage manage cuz i think thatll be fun.  or at least something new and interesting.  so ya...thatll be fun...            well thats about it...so ill bbl"], "gold_label": 0.0}

We stayed in Flagstaff Sat. night at this great hotel where you get FREE DRINKS from 5:30-7:30, free massages, and free breakfast the next am (Embassy Suites...and yes it is a national thing, we asked!).

I alternately wanted to be either an artist or a nun.  No kidding.    Some days I would make drawings, create little picture books, and doodle endlessly with the idea that one day I would use my god-given talent to create great works of art.  Other days I would drape a towel over my hair and, instead of pretending it was long flowing locks, would imagine myself in a nuns habit.  I wondered how I would look as one of gods servants.  I wasnt even Catholic.  Of course, it never occurred to me that I could possibly do both  be an artist and a servant.  Some people figured that out and created great works of art devoted to their faith and religion.  I guess it just wasnt meant for me.  These days, I dont paint or draw.  Although I've got plenty of servitude going on while I'm raising my children.  And believe me, there are plenty of days when I achieve sainthood, simply by not killing them during those more trying times.

She donned a new outfit - black skirt, white blouse with sparkly brooch; she did up her hair, put on a little lip gloss and selected an evening bag.  Topped off with my black wrap, she looked as if she'd always gone to the Opera.  She sat perched on the edge of her seat for many scenes, my opera glasses at the end of nose, peering alternately at the stage and the English translations.  I was so proud of her, and so glad that I was able to expose her to something that I think is just wonderful.  She agreed with me; it is something wonderful and she said she really liked it.   She's already selected at least two operas from next season that she would like to see.  Ah, my little diva is growing up.  Diva out."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I'm up trying to make a vocab test for the kids that I tutor, but after staring at the screen for a while I realize that my creativity is shot at the moment.  I have to write another entry, there's too much going on in my mind.  It's been over an year since my heart finally imploded.  It was the culmination of so many things that had happened up until that point, and it took one final event to push me over to the edge.  Needless to say, it's already been a year, and I'm still trying to heal.  How could I let everything get to me?  I gave into all the temptations to be lazy, to quit even attempting to go at it in life, but all that come out of it was burnout and dropping out of graduate school.  Here I am, a prideful, selfish, lazy young man that lost his way.  I've tried to get myself back on track, but the track's blown apart, and there's no Superman to fill in the hole and let the train run safely.  Or is there?  Most of my peers are well on their ways to becoming lawyers and doctors, entering the workforce, and fighting through grad school.  They are the culmination of their parents' dreams; all the pressure, all the expectations have begun to come into fruition as they build their personal strongholds in society.  But me?  I washed out.  I've been tutoring have trained to teach Kaplan SAT classes in order to sustain myself as I try to come to grips with myself as a person, as I search for my desire and calling in life.  Statements ring in my head:   Remember the Creator the days of your youth; the conclusion, when all has been heard, is to fear God and keep His commandments, this applies to every person;  Love the Lord Your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.   God, I've tried to run away from these statements with my actions, but He won't let them die in my mind.  How does my calling come into place?  How do I follow these statements?  Every day I awake, and go through the daily routine of 'what has to be done.'  During these times, I'm conscious of God, talking to Him, thinking about Him.  But is that it?  Is that it?  Why am I still so lost, so confused, so unsatisfied with myself, and therefore finding reasons to be unsatisfied with everything around me?  Why do I have such a hard time pursuing Jesus?  I think of  urlLink John 15 .  Why still the disconnect?  I can't help escape this feeling that I'm never where I should be.  This sensation has filled me all of my life, but never has it hit so hard until the past couple of years.   Is this it?  Am I destined to constantly daydream but never dream hard and pursue accordingly?  Is that all I'll ever be?  Am I destined to be constantly enslaved by the current distraction that takes my fancy?\n\nText 2:urlLink http://www.betterlucktomorrow.com/   For you folks in New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco, check it out early April.

Didn't get near what I wanted to get done on this trip--had planned on heading downtown to see a few buds but couldn't get the time to get away at all.  A few friends made the trek up to our place, though, which was cool.  It's nice to see friends you've known for 10-20 years after being away for a while.  One guy that came up here was a friend of a sister of a friend who is marrying (as soon as he gets the familial blessing) a Korean, so my wife and I gave him the 411 on Koreans and ways to do things.  (More on that when I get back to Seoul, and have more time.)  Got to go now.\n\nText 2:Last night I saw  urlLink Silmido . Man, it reminded me of The Dirty Dozen. The (true) story is: the North sent a platoon (31 men) of commandos to Seoul in January 1968 to kill then-president/dictator Park Chung Hee (he was later assassinated by a cabinet member in 1979). Their plan was thwarted, but the South wanted revenge so they set up an ultra-secret crack team of 31 (always have copy, it seems) of their own. But, they didn't recruit from the general infantry or even the armed forces at all. The members of Unit 684, as it was called, were criminals on death row who (they found out afterwards) were already known as dead to the world and, thus, would not be missed if they failed (or if they succeeded).   The 31 went through extensive and brutal training on Silmido (Silmi Island) but 31 real special forces members plus a commander. For 2 years they prepared themselves physically and mentally to 'slit the throat of Kim Il-Sung' (the leader of NK at the time, and father of the current dictator, Kim Il-Jung). The time to leave and complete their mission came and they set out to Pyongyang...but at the last moment it was cancelled. The Minister of Intelligence had changed and relations had thawed between the two Koreas (I wonder what catastrophe would have befallen this place if they had succeeded). With no reason to be, Unit 684 was to be terminated.   The story goes on a ways from there, and everyone knows it..which may have been the point of the South Korean government. Imagine if a foreign power (and hated enemy) sent a team to kill President Bush or John Major...how could they just let it go. But, as in this case, how could they let it happen? This sacrificing of deathrow inmates makes sense from a political point of view. The South got to show that they were ready, willing and able to go after Kim Il-Sung, but, in the end, it would have probably put the Peninsula back in to a brutal and devastating war.    urlLink     Silmido and The Dirty Dozen: the true story is more unreal than fiction.

Flower  is taken from Liz Phair's 'Exile in Guyville.'  I'll also include the lyrics to  'H.W.C'  from her self-titled and much bally-hooed self-titled effort.   Flower    Everytime I see your face I get all wet between my legs Everytime you pass me by, I heave a sigh of pain  Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste I want to fuck you like a dog I'll take you home and make you like it Everything you ever wanted Everything you ever thought of Is everything I'll do to you I'll fuck you and your minions, too Your face reminds me of a flower Kind of like you're underwater Hair's too long and in your eyes Your lips a perfect 'suck me' size You act like you're fourteen years old Everything you say is so obnoxious, funny, true and mean I want to be your blowjob queen You're probably shy and introspective That's not part of my objective I just want your fresh, young jimmy Turning, slamming, ramming in me Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste I want to fuck you like a dog I'll take you home and make you like it Everything you ever wanted Everything you ever thought of Is everything I'll do to you I'll fuck you till your dick is blue  Everytime   And now, for your comparison pleasure, here are the lyrics for  'H.W.C.'    H.W.C.    Give it to me, don't give it away Don't think about what the others say My skins getting clear, my hairs so bright All you do is fuck me every day and night  You're my secret beauty routine Na, na, na, na, what my body has seen I am lookin' good and I'm feeling nice Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum  I'm gonna pull you back down between the sheets Everything is fresher when the day is sweet In the morning light when you're already on the phone  Face it, one of these days Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray It's the fountain of youth It's the meaning of life So hot, so sweet, so wet my appetite  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum  Face it, one of these days Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray It's the fountain of youth It's the meaning of life Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Your hot white cum.   Personally, I think the lyrics in 'Flower' are a bit more carnal and smutty than the lyrics of 'H.W.C.'  I'd be hard pressed to find someone who disagrees with me.  So she says 'cum' a couple times.  No big deal.  My two cents:  I can't and won't limit myself to the music (books & movies) I enjoy solely by their artistic merit.  I can't.  I had a friend growing up (and I'm not making parallel comparisons, please don't think that's my intent) who did that to the point where it bordered on ridiculous.  If a CD he purchased sold more than 10,000 copies, it was immediately brought to Cheapo (where they don't give you much for CDs.  Might I suggest BookSmart or Half-Price Books?).  The reason being?  He didn't want his collection tainted with music that was considered popular or loved by the masses.  He has over 1,000 CDs in his collection and you'd be lucky to find 50 that you recognize.  Like Panda, I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion.  There's no point in it.  You either dig something, or you don't.  For me, I like Liz Phair's new album.  Do I love it?  No, but I don't hate it either.  To me, it doesn't seem like she's thrown all of her old tricks away to completely sell out.  Not at all.  Yeah, she's trying to reach a new audience and there's always that risk of alienating your old fans.  I read somewhere that she recorded a few albums between this one and 'whitechocolatespaceegg' that she absolutely hated and scrapped completely, never to see the light of day.  I'm sorry, but I like me some variety.  If you were to go through my CD collection, bookshelves, and wall of DVDs I think you'd see a pretty broad cross-section of titles.  I can't overly concern myself with what is too commercial, too popular or what lacks artistic merit.  It's too limiting for me.  I like really shitty movies and I like ones that are though-provoking and make the hair on my arms stand up.  Same goes with music.  I can't concern myself with who produced what track and what their motivations were for doing so.  If Liz wanted The Matrix to produce a couple of tracks to give her sound a more wide appeal, then so be it.  I could care less that he produced Avril Lavigne's album.  So what?  That seems to be a foothold for most of the critics of Liz's new album.  Well, does that mean I should hate one of my favorite groups N.E.R.D. because the people in the group produced Justin Timberlake's album or a song or two for Britney Spears?  Nope.  Okay...this became a rant without me wanting it to be, but let me close with saying that I'm not absolutely in love with the new Liz Phair CD, but I like it well enough that I'm looking forward to seeing her perform again with some friends.  I've read plenty of reviews of her album and none of them (save for People magazine) have been favorable.  The bottom line is: it's not art and I don't think it's pretending to be.  It's just a different direction for an artist that people were expecting more (of the same) from."], "gold_label": 1.0}
