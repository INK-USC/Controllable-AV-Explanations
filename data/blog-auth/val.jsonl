I am, yet again, miserable. But, this time, it wasn't the usual suspects that have caused my discontent. I've questioned my life quite a bit, today. Lots has happened, and, the only thing that has changed is  now, its something different that's making me miserable. I was very prepared to leave, the clincher was that I was not allowed to do so. I will not bite my tongue! I am still ready to go at any moment. Whether or not I will be any happier is unknown to me. James told me I could stay with him, but, I doubt I can handle that. Despite how often he says he loves and respects me, I know what he is, and what he does. And, even though I am aware of these facts, I find it easier to deny that they take place as long as I do not have to witness it. Call it silly; call it what you will, but, its far easier then facing what I know. All I desire is serenity.\n\nText 2:When you bitch and moan and generally turn into a vegetable, a potato of dullness, you star to panic. Fuck man if I keep going into this self indulged hellhole, I will become everything I despise, so please let me find the strength to stop it and actually just relax and be ...fucking sane. Just Sane. Urgh, when you suddenly have to look into yourself from so much head-butting, you think, you'll be much more wiser, but in reality the hurt is physically apparent and self inducing, therefore it's just you, you, you, you. Get over it. But as Zaida once said, if we weren't self conscious we wouldn't be able to grow as people, remember that. There has to be a fine line between knowing when you're fucking up and thinking that you're a precious fucking sunbeam. Do I need to spell it out? Well okay, if you know you're fucking up, you realise you have limits, when you think you are a victim and are truly a pearl of a girl then thats when you go mad. No-one changes when they think they are special and unique and can do no wrong.So I went today and brought an UAC guide, I went through the courses and found some I liked, because I had to go to The Guy who Suddenly was 19s house I didn't actually sit down and write down my plan of attack and stuff, didn't do outlines and do the whole Pro and Cons thing, I want to do the whole design computer course, I want to be able to do animation and communication studies. Wow, Wow. Let's slow down? I can't you know, I just can't. This is it you know, my finger rising up above my brain, I'm jumping in and I'm going to do this and so what? 3-4 years of extensive art making, contacts to be made, Melbourne to visit, a novel to write. I'm just so sick of letting things slide between my fingers, don't you feel that? That just by being indifferent you are just perpetuating the problem, so to be able to be happy you have to just try it. So fuck it, Im going to try it. Cool, yeah?Damn I'm craving chocolate. I'm afraid to say it but today mainly consisted of Anaconda snakes, stolen sips of Coke post mix, some twisties and a cheeseburger. I watched Out Cold and actually fell in love with  urlLink  Zach Galifianakis  , but for a brief second. The movie truly sucked, if it hadnt been for his performance I would've walked out, well I did walk out, I went to go get my Mango Smoothie. Phil loved it and I was pretty much bemused by it all, the Cigarette Boy walked by and I didnt say hi because every time I see him I think about those evil thoughts I have of him and I go nuts. I have to just lay low about the whole thing, its getting too obvious.  *Sigh* and double sigh. I learnt nothing about the world today and you know what?

Like,  really  strange. Every keyboard or mouse event seems to generate a very, very quiet click from inside the machine; moving your finger around the trackpad sounds like a geiger counter.  It's not the audio system -- turning the speaker off doesn't stop it happening. I don't think it's software-related, either (certainly my iBook didn't make these noises, and neither does the desktop G4 in the next room). It doesn't  sound like the drive seeking. It  might  be some  kind of electrical interference directly tweaking  the speakers, but I don't particularly want to start opening up the laptop and snipping wires to find out. Anyone got any ideas? It's driving me nuts -- I get paranoid when computers do things I can't explain ...   Update : I found other Powerbook owners complaining of the same thing at  Powerbook Zone , so it's not just my imagination.

When I started this blog, I really didn't want it to become political. I should have known myself better. I apologize to all of you for my rantings and ravings...I promise they won't be frequent. My polite Southern upbringing taught me to discuss politics and religion with caution...because inevitably you will offend. I hope what I'm about to write doesn't offend anyone. They're just my opinions, and since I can be pretty stupid about trivial issues, I hardly think I have a monopoly on cosmic Truth. But let me tell you about myself.  As early as 1990, as a middle schooler, I began listening and adoring Rush Limbaugh. If you're a conservative Republican, I've walked in your shoes. I've made your arguments. I've marched on state capitols for your causes, I've written letters to newspapers, and I've designed 'principled' t-shirts touting your slogans. In 1997, I served as the Vice President of the College Republicans of Arkansas. I've sat in the living room of the governor's mansion in Arkansas with current GOP Gov. Mike Huckabee. I've told my share of Clinton jokes. I am (still, oddly) a huge fan of Ronald Reagan.  But over the past 4-5 years, I've been slowly rethinking (refining?) my views. See, if you're as hard-core and as young as I was, watching history and seeing facts (not blind ideology) can be quite a bummer.  It's easy to announce to your fellow high school classmates in 1993 that Clinton's tax hike will crush the economy and ruin the middle class...until you see that the balanced budget it created lowered interest rates and expanded the financial markets that provided the biggest economic expansion in history.  It's easy to trash welfare and say it's not the government's responsibility to help the poor, but when you hear Republican politicians tell you racist and sexist jokes over dinner and hear good Christian people say it's not the federal gov't's responsibility...or state gov't's...or local gov't's...or the Church's...and then don't do anything themselves...you gotta wonder if they really care that much at all.  It's easy to vote Republican because you believe in protecting the rights of the unborn...but then when the Republican party you help elect controls the White House, both houses of Congress, a majority on the Supreme Court, a majority of governorships...and doesn't ONCE attempt to rollback Roe V. Wade, can you take them seriously any longer? It's in their platform, and has been since 1984. Why aren't they doing anything? If you vote Republican because you want to end abortion, has it worked? Will you still vote for them because of this issue? Why? Why has the abortion rate in this country risen in the past 4 years while it declined during the Clinton presidency? Did your pro-life vote work? Will your future 'pro-life' vote work?  It's easy to argue that insuring those without health insurance would be too expensive and disastrous for health care in our country, but then when you turn 21 and you're booted off your parents insurance plan, you realize there are some pretty significant holes in our country's health care system. I look back at my fully-insured, smug, carefree 15-year-old self arguing there was nothing flawed with our current system - and I laugh because I can't cry.  It's easy to argue against an assault-weapons ban because you're a staunch defender of the 2nd amendment, but then when a democrat president bans them and crime drops in this country...and the nation's liberty doesn't shrivel because of it...maybe those folks at the NRA and GOP look a little nutty.  It's easy to be a Republican and argue that democrats want to tax-and-spend, but when you see a Democrat balance the federal budget - a feat not accomplished by a Republican president since Eisenhower - it makes you rethink things. And when a president with a huge budget surplus and a robust economy leaves the country to a GOP president who creates a huge deficit and cripples the economy, it makes you feel betrayed for all those years you worked your heart out for a common-sense government.  It's easy to be a flag-waving, anthem-singing, patriotic Republican...until you realize that all the things you cherish so deeply in your country...free time with family (granted by those pesky unions who wanted a 40-hour work week), equality (voting rights for all), an expansive middle class, freedom to worship your God, a beautiful environment, civil rights, economic protection for the elderly, public education...ALL these things were advocated by liberals and opposed by conservatives. All of them. If you're a hard-core Republican and you love your country (which most of you do), have you ever thought about what your country would look like if your party had unbridled power for our 228 years of history? How can you be so myopic?  It's easy to argue that a president of the opposing party should be impeached for telling a lie to the American people regarding his sexual habits...but tell me...how hard is it to look the other way when the president of YOUR party lies to the American people and gets us in a war that kills over 900 soldiers and countless innocent Iraqi citizens?  Isn't a lie a lie?  That's what I learned in church.  Look, folks...I'm not a democrat. Far from it. I'm not telling you to go vote for Kerry (even if I do think he made a fairly compelling speech last night). I'm just saying this...as I get older, I find myself becoming less political. I read 'Mere Discipleship' by Lee Camp over 6 months ago, and I can honestly say it really changed my way of thinking. I may not even vote in this election (I live in California...will my vote matter?) There are plenty...plenty...of things in the democratic party I don't like, either. I too thought Clinton was a creep for what he did. But he can't come back to elected office; further, John Kerry ain't Bill Clinton.  My conscience won't let me rest until I fully confront what I believe is the Republican party's desire to woo (manipulate?) Christian people with empty promises. Folks, I've walked in those shoes. I've seen the manipulation. I've held the coats while the metaphorical Stephens were stoned. I've even cast a few stones myself.  And I've moved on.    ps. What can I say? Click  urlLink here .

Add to this the fact that not everyone comments about you to your face, and you're left with a pretty odd feeling. Not you -- me. Of course I'm talking about me!  In the past couple of days, I've been given many half-compliments that really don't seem to describe me at all. As you read my stories, keep in mind that these are things people 'accused' me of in attempting to say something 'nice.' Today really topped it all.   Early in the day, a customer has a problem. He wants to talk to a manager. I tell him precisely what the manager will tell him, but he says 'you're too nice for me to argue with.' My manager, who is not nice, got into a little argument with him. All either of them wanted to do today was argue.  One of the guys I work with called me bubbly. He says I'm always happy. Granted, I am happy, but I have never been called bubbly and can't understand my general love of life being mistaken for stupid effervescence. Speaking of  the smile , one customer I kept waiting for a very long time commented to Dave about me smiling (while on the phone resolving another issue). This made me feel good, until Dave then said to the man, 'yeah, she's great -- always has a grin on.' Grin makes me think sheepish or evil. Neither of which, I hope, describes me.  One last note. This is really what started the whole entry, about an intended compliment that would be a compliment if the person stopped a few sentences shorter. One customer told me I am very pretty. Thank you, I said. Then he said, 'with all that hair and those big teeth...' Yikes. Way to call out a freak."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I watched  Episode II  and  Spiderman . Both were in my opinion extremely good movies. As for my brother's statement about  Spiderman  being better? That's arguable. To me both movies were so incredibly different that it's hard to compare. True both are familiar, science-fiction / action films; however, they serve different purposes. It's clear that  Episode II  is part of a larger series of movies. There's a lot of linking and tying in of plot and characters of what will be all 6 movies. That means there's a lot of stuff going on. Actually after watching it twice, I picked up on a lot of the linking stuff. It's almost overwhelming how much they pack in.  Spiderman  is one movie with a straighforward single plot. In a way I liked how  Episode II  kept me thinking and tying things together. However, I liked how  Spiderman  was just a great simple movie, that only briefly focused on how there could be sequel. Visually,  Episode II  was better; however, sometimes it did seem too much. I dunno... if it was a competition, I'd give it a tie.  Anyway... after the movies, Jon and I had some Del Taco and then I dropped him off. I pretty much went home and slept for 4 hours. Talk about a lazy ass eh? Well I did manage to catch 2nd hour of the finale of X-files, do my Soc Sci 3a stuff and get up to 10 pages done of my history paper. That's 66% done! Woohoo.  Things to do for tomorrow:  Go to class.  Turn in my Soc Sci 3a assignment  Get my insurance thing stamped.  Use my $25 gift certificate at Quicksilver... I'll probably get some shorts or something.

I'm glad to hear that MoM went so well; I would've loved to have gone. And I want to thank you guys for saying I didn't have to-- that means you are first-class, stand-up guys.  Oh, dear. Okay. This is all I have to say about the youth group situation, and then I hope it's all done. The idea that religion isn't important to us, or whatever, probably came from my post, although that's not what I meant to imply at all. It's just that I went to Sunday School for eight years. I've been confirmed. And I've been in groups where you just learn the seven sacraments over and over, but then I've also been in groups where everybody knows the sacraments and we get to talk about more personal aspects of faith. So Marten, Thomas, and Michael convinced me to come to youth group and I thought, okay, these are people I would be happy to do that with. I feel really bad for contributing to the breakdown of the larger group. I felt horrible when Patty pointed it out, I felt horrible when Jonah pointed it out. And I do appreciate that you guys have to keep going there and have to find some way to make it work. The point of my earlier post was more to make a suggestion than to complain, but if it rubbed people the wrong way, I'm sorry. Really. I know you're all wonderful people, and I'm sure Patty and the rest of the people in the group are as well. I'm done talking now.  On a lighter note, Lookit! I learned how to change the thingy!  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!\n\nText 2:I had an interview today.  Not really what I expected.  I was ready to go in there and answer all sorts of questions about my work experience and all that, but she just told me about the job, asked me what I like to do when I am not working, and asked me if I had any questions.  It seems like a cool job.  Doesn't pay much, of course, but I guess I need to start somewhere.    I didn't sleep well last night....again.  I put in a movie, but I just wasn't tired.  So then I played some Free Cell, and I still wasn't tired.  Then I woke up at 3:30, and I did that count.  If I fall asleep now, I can still get 4 hours of sleep.  My alarm went off and I really did not want to get up.  It's so cold in the morning.  I just wanted to stay under the blankets.  But I feel good now.  It's nice to get up early and get things done.  I went to my interview, and then forced myself to go to the grocery store.  I didn't know where to go considering every place is on strike, so I went to damn Foods Co.  First of all, I always get a bunk cart, and I put a case of bottled water in it, and that threw everything off.  I could barely push the damn thing once I got my water and soda in it.  Yeah I said 'soda'.  So I was going to get some meat.  Some chicken and hamburger.  But I never end up buying it.  I hate buying meat.  I don't know why either.  So I get all my stuff, and I wanted some cottage cheese.  I look at the date on it, and it says, 'sell by dec 14'.....um hello, it's the friggin 18th.  So I decided that was the last time I go there.  I'll cross the damn picket lines if it means I can get fresh cottage cheese.  And the other day when Scott bought some cheese, it was moldy already.  So the old cottage cheese is the last straw.  And I forgot half the stuff I needed.    Being here alone is getting easier by the day.  I thought for sure I was going to lose it, but I think I am ok.  I talked to some friends last night, and that definitely helps.  I talked to my mom, and she seems to be doing better.  I told her I would be home soon to visit....I don't know how soon, but I will get there.  So anyway, I am going home to eat lunch."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I really don't like being a cardiac nurse.  That said, I'm going to work on a transfer.  Yes, I know it's only a couple of months.  But why be miserable for a couple of months if I don't want to be?  Beyond all that, I never wanted to be a coordinator.  I am going to talk to the HR people in the very near future and see what I can work out.    I'm getting cold feet about the whole moving to Hillsborough thing.  Don't ask me why, because I don't have an answer for you.  Maybe being away from Scott.  I've never lived on my own before, and even though I'd be living with people, I'd be ' by myself' for the first time since I lived in NJ (which, by the way, was the worst eighteen months of my life).  I can come up with a million reasons why it isn't a good idea for me to go, but on the other hand, I really love the idea of being able to go to the temple more than once a month.  I don't know.  I have to just leave things in Krishna's hands.  I had written to Gurudeva asking if it would be all right for me to worship Laddu Gopal.  This is Krishna as a baby, and He is just adorable.  It's something I've wanted to do for a long time now, but Gurudeva said no, so I can't.  I'm disappointed, but just like anything, a disciple has to be obedient to the spiritual master.  This all comes with trusting and following.  Sometimes it's not the easiest thing in the world, but nothing really good is easy, is it?  One thing he stressed was giving heart and soul to the holy names, so I am going to make a concerted effort to really improve the quality of my japa.  Since I know you'll be interested to know how I do on my diet, I will be posting as I lose weight.  And then someday when I'm quite lovely and thin I will post some before and after pictures.  But for the time being, I'll just be letting you know how much I lose.  I don't plan on having my cholesterol checked anytime soon as the last time I had it done it was 160.  That's all part of being a vegetarian.  But hopefully, I'll be able to report some substantial weight loss in the coming weeks.  Beyond that, I'm just pretty tired, so I think I'll be going to bed.  Of course, I had some fantastic and profound thoughts I was going to write about, but in all the hysteria at work last night (once again, shortstaffed, four nurses because they took one away from us)I forgot it.  Someday I'd like to work in a job where there's enough staff.  Although, on the bright side, I suppose, all this running and sweating is going to help me lose weight faster.

So Im just going to concede that everyone has their own tastes, and leave it at that.  Im crabby today.  As most of you know, I volunteer each month for 3 lousy hours.  For those who dont know, in this time, I help prepare a meal for the less fortunate, aka our friends in the alcoholic/schizophrenic homeless community.  About every 4 months or so, I take a turn and plan the meal.  Meaning, I figure out what to cook for dinner for about 125 men, go to the grocery store and purchase said food items on a budget of about $100 (I am reimbursed for the expense), and bring this meal to a place where I prepare it with about 5 other volunteers.  Its a pain to do, but as I said before, I only do it a few times each year.  So on Sunday I went to the Cub foods that I hate (the one in Edina) and picked up 20 boxes of pasta, 20 jars of meat sauce, several pounds of cheese, a few pounds of carrots (even drug addicts need their Vitamin D, yo) and a huge box of Oreos (drug addicts especially like the Oreos).  Granted, its not gourmet, but you try keeping things imaginative at less than $1/head.  I get the usual stares from people in the store  what?  A girl cant stock up???  pay up, and leave.  Shopping isnt the big headache in this process, folks.  Its the hauling.  As you can guess, the items above are heavy.  And Im one girl.  So after shopping, I load the items in my car.  And then I realize that 20 jars of pasta sauce will likely freeze in my trunk.  And the carrots and cheese probably wont do so hot, either.  So I leave the pasta in the trunk and haul everything else up to my apartment.  Bags are ripped, multiple trips made, but the job finally gets done.  The fridge is full, and Ive got a few bags of sauce to navigate, but its only for a day or two, so no big deal.  This is no worse than the time I had 30 pounds of ground beef bleed all over my refrigerator, but thats a story for another time.  Today I get an email from someone else in the group (who, for the record, I adore) saying she purchased the meal for tonight, so I write back and say, gee, thats great, but I already did that too.    Several of us back-and-forth-ed over what should we do?, and it looks like Im going to have to haul everything over there, and still end up hauling much of it back to be stored by yours truly for a month, at which time I can haul it over there again.  So Im irritated.\n\nText 2:Here she is - my niece. Finally got to meet her tonight. I know in the  pictures, she does look a bit odd, but she is in truth one of the  prettiest babies I've ever seen. She has a full head of dark hair and  incredibly long toes.             So far, I've seen her perform the following acts:      *Crying   *Hicupping   *Sneezing   *Vomiting up mucus      The bottom two are due to the need for newborns to clear out their respiratory system. Nice.             Jo is doing well. She looked tired and pale, but seems to have taken to being a mother easily.      I got mocked for being broody. Why? Because I picked Felicity up when she was crying! What was I meant to do, leave her?             A quick question for tech minded people - I need a cheap or free movie  editor. I have a movie of her squirming about and hicupping and was  going to put it on line, but I think 4Mb for 15sec of 'action' is a bit  much."], "gold_label": 0.0}

We've been laying in bed watching 'Crossing Over'. Now I usually think that this show is a total joke, but I dunno the more I watch it the more I think that it is real. But anyways, Brandon couldn't come over last night ): But I know that I just have to try and understand with him moving and all, that he's not gonna be able to do something for a while until he's all unpacked. It's been 3 weeks and one day today between us...he asked me out on October 27th. It's funny how we've been together for so little time, yet we have so many inside jokes and memories, it feels as if we've known each other for ever. Me and Brandon I'd have to say are a perfect match, it's weird cause I always knew that there was that one person out there made just for me. But, I never knew that I would find him this quickly. It's the best feeling in the world to be with Brandon and I hope it never ends...\n\nText 2:Today was pretty good...kinda boring, but I wasn't sick today. English was easy, just listening to people read 'House on Mango Street'.  In Oral Interpretation we did some congress debate while there was a sub. Chem we looked at elements and how they look when they explode. O ha and in chem Mark Ortega got escorted outta the room by none other than our friendly security, Tony. Don't know what he did, but he won't tell anyone. Spanish I took a test, and did hw...from other classes. P.E. I taught Jessika and Natalie all of our dance, we're getting pretty good. At lunch I bought the whole cafeteria so Alissa, Lindsey, Jen, and I could eat. Sociology I took notes while Dillon Rhosdahl was falling asleep. And in Geometry we had a fire drill, took a quiz, and talked. After school I went to tutor, almost falling asleep on her, but now, here I am talking to you people. But anyways last night I was talking with Brandon as usual and he tells me that he's going to be joining the wrestling team to keep in shape for football. Now, for those of you who don't know much about wrestling, guys have to wear spandex one-piece-jumpers. Wow is this going to be fun or what?! Now this means that he's going to be gone after school at practice ): More time for me to sit here and think about him, waiting for him to call around 6. But, sometimes I can go see him at his meets and kick ass so it's all good! Today I experienced a sad notation, Jessika Spiteri does not have any clue who Tupac is. Now, seriously, how could someone not know about Tupac? He's one of the best, and if even THE best rapper who ever lived. Well, this shows you people how sad living in Danville can be. Now, don't get me wrong, I LUV Danville, it's just that sometimes it gets to be too big of a bubble. So anyways I better start my chem hw...yea that's right, chemistry in the 9th grade, crazy huh? My mom doesn't think so, so of course I can't think so either. But, it's not that hard, I mean I have Shotwell. Anyone with Shotwell should have no lower that a C; do your hw, if even, and you're set. Yea, so I'll be writing back soon...maybe in an hour."], "gold_label": 1.0}

As you know, I don't watch much tv.  The thought of Scooby Doo was sort of inviting, and so I headed to Boomerang, only to be disappointed by the sudden appearance of Scrappy Doo, which was the worst thing ever to happy to Shag and Scoob.  I mean, who thought of that obnoxious little rat?  Anyway, I started flipping through, and I came across PBS and an entirely bizarre psychedelic type show with five little fat Kewpie dolls in cowl neck sweaters that bounced around (rather in a cute kind of way, but very surreal).  I couldn't come up with any kind of plot or educational value whatsoever, but after about the first five minutes I was positively mesmerised.  It was kind of scary.  Kind of makes you realise why they call it 'programming', you know?  Anyway, all this show needed was a good bit of illegal substances to go with it.  I could not for the life of me figure it out.  Finally I discovered that this weirdness is named 'Boohbah' (I thought at first it was some kind of weird Japanese word) and that it's some kind of distant cousin to the original TV surrealists, the Teletubbies.  Here's the official word from the official website:  ABOUT BOOHBAH   Boohbah is an exciting new programme for children, with a format that fosters both creative thinking and creative movement. Boohbah is entirely designed to encourage physical action on the part of its young viewers. It deliberately combines infectious magical movement, for children to imitate, with inset stories for them to predict outcomes.   The design of the show - visually and otherwise, draws upon early concepts in science, maths and art and combines these with \u2018televisual magic\u2019 to create a uniquely funny television experience.   The Boohbahs, five magical atoms of power, light and fun travel in their Boohball around the world, from child to child. Fifteen countries are visited throughout the changing title sequence.   The Boohbahs represent the imaginative power and light which allows children to control the screen action by the use of the magic word \u201cBoohbah\u201d, and send presents into an imaginary Storyworld for the Storypeople - Grandmamma, Grandpappa, Mrs Lady, Mr Man, Brother and Sister, Auntie and Little Dog Fido to play with and make a story in partnership with them. We hear the children intervening in the screen action by the sound of their blowing and their use of the word \u201cBoohbah\u201d. This motivates the action and moves the story along. Only Little Dog Fido is not wholly in their control! Children are totally engaged and have a lot of fun guessing which Storyperson will appear and what will happen next.   I don't think you ought to let your kid watch this stuff.  There's just something not right about it.  You watch it yourself and see.  It's just a little too bizarre and not relatable to anything in actual experience.  I don't know what kind of child psychiatrist consults for them, but as far as I'm concerned, this show is purely an excuse for an addict to get high.  I mean I know this sounds a bit harsh, after all, it's just a children's show.  You watch it and see how your eyes glaze over.  Do you really want your kid hopping around squeaking nonsense words?

Just when you thought it was the politically correct thing to do as a white male, to blame racism for the ongoing struggles of blacks in America, Bill Cosby upsets the apple cart and says there's no excuse.   During Thursday's speech, Cosby said his detractors were not facing the facts about poor black communities and were just trying to cover up what he called their 'dirty laundry.'   'Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it's cursing and calling each other n----r as they're walking up and down the street,' he said.   Cosby continued railing about the state of black youth in America. 'They think they're hip,' he said. 'They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere.'   To African-American men, Cosby ranted, 'Stop beating up your women because you can't find a job.'   He complained about rap music: 'When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'n----r this' and 'n----r that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car--those children hear that. And I am telling you when you put the CD on and then you get up and dance to it What are you saying to your children?'   And he also ripped into sitcoms targeting African-American audiences: 'Comedians coming on TV [saying,] 'I am so ugly, you are ugly, yuck, yuck.' That's all minstrel show stuff. I am tired of it.'   'I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is'...and I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk,' Cosby said in May. 'And then I heard the father talk...Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth.'   On Thursday, Cosby further elaborated his thoughts on the subject, saying once again that white people aren't to blame for teen pregnancy and high-school dropout rates.   'For me there is a time...when we have to turn the mirror around,' he said. 'Because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us. And it keeps a person frozen in their seat, it keeps you frozen in your hole you're sitting in.'    Easier said than done coming from a very wealthy man?  I don't know.  Does he minimize the very real impact of ongoing racism and socioeconomic inequality clearly held in place by a dominant white power structure?  Could be.  Does what he say have value?  No doubt.  It is not 'Uncle Tom' to take a hard look at how racism and inequality become internalized by the oppressed, to examine how this internalization often manifests as irrational, sometimes self-destructive behavior and cultural trends.    It took guts for Cosby to take this stance and I'm glad Jesse Jackson is supporting him.\n\nText 2:So guys, if,   IF   we do not have school tomorrow, Please do not deign  it neccessary to call me and tell me we  don't have school.

Today was a pretty damn nice day after all! Sun actually came out and allowed a good 25 miles of biking before it started to rain for about 5 minutes. Luckily I was pulling up to my apartment just as the rain started. So that gave me some time to eat a little something-something and check the newsgroups online to see if there was anything good. The rain kicked off and I snagged my fishing pole and tackle box to head on down to the river for a few hours of fishing time. I had much better luck going out all earlier-like today than I usually do getting out so late after work. I pulled in around 12 fish although most of them were really small, but I had 3 nice size buggers. This side of the river was full of people fishing, too. I'm guessing these guys were sitting by their windows at home all weekend with a tear slowly falling from their eye until they finally saw the sun come out today. Now I actually don't know what to do for the rest of the evening. It's cooling off too much to go back out, getting kinda dark for going on another bike ride. I should have rented  urlLink Bubba Ho-tep  tonight, but I think I'll get that for tomorrow night (Domino's 2 for 1 night = movie night). I think I'll just end up playing some Hordes of the Underdark for a while and go to bed early. Maybe stuff my face with some food later, too. Yeah. Food sounds really good right now.  And for whatever reason I have  urlLink Sarah Polley  in the head lately  (see previous post bitching about wanting Dawn of the Dead to finally come out on DVD) .

First off, let's get the familial explanations out of the way, so I can proceed without running around in circles trying to explain exactly how everyone is or is not related.  Frankie Vanover, the deceased, is not actually my grandmother, but I've called her 'Grandma' all my life.  Her daughters are Billie and Louise, who are known to me as Aunt Bill and Aunt Lou.  Aunt Bill is married to my Uncle Mike, who is my dad's brother, so she actually is my aunt.  Aunt Lou, being her sister, is not technically a relation, since the connection is by marriage.  However, Aunt Bill is the one who took care of me when I was younger while my parents were at work, and she and Aunt Lou are very close, so I spent a lot of time with both of them.  Aunt Lou and her husband (Uncle Clarence) have a daughter (Rachel) who is a just a few years older than I am, and we grew up together.  The point I'm trying to get across is this:  technically, I'm not related to Aunt Lou, Uncle Clarence, and/or Rachel, but they are all  family , in the more important sense of the word.  Also, Uncle Mike and Aunt Bill have a son named Mike, who also has a son named Mike.  For clarity's sake, although he isn't nearly as crazy as he used to be, the middle Mike will henceforth be referred to by his old nickname, 'Crazy Mike,' and his son Mike, who is only a few years younger than me and is a close friend as well as an actual blood relative, will just be known as Mike.  Now that we're all clear on that (sure we are), a story.  A couple of years ago, my mom and I went with Aunt Bill and Aunt Lou to go visit Grandma at the nursing home.  She had Alzheimer's disease, and it had been a while since I had seen her.  They told me she probably wouldn't recognize me, as she often didn't recognize people, even the people she saw frequently.  So we went in and walked into her room, and she got a big smile on her face and said, 'Well, there's Jon!'  Being around that side of the family as much as I was when I was younger, I was one of her favorites.  Spending so much time with Rachel, who actually was her granddaughter, I was like one of the grandchildren.  In fact, I found out yesterday that I was actually counted among the grandchildren.  That made me feel pretty good.  At any rate, I took the day off from work and drove down to Troy for the funeral.  I'm really glad I did.  I wanted to be there for my family, and I could tell it meant a lot to them that I made it.  We get together only rarely, and it was good to see a lot of people I hadn't seen in a long time.  It just sucks that someone had to die for it to happen.  I make it into Troy only infrequently now, so I don't see Aunt Bill and Uncle Mike or Aunt Lou and Uncle Clarence and Rachel nearly as much as I used to.  Crazy Mike lives in Pennsylvania now, I think, so I definitely don't see him very often.  Also present was my cousin Dave (another son of Uncle Mike and Aunt Bill), who lives in the area but is mostly MIA.  These guys are quite a bit older than I am, and because of the age difference, this was the first time I can recall that I could sit down and talk to them and actually relate to them.  Rachel, Mike, and I used to play Atari games with Dave years ago, but that wasn't quite the same.  Another person I saw for the first time in quite a while was Rachel's cousin Tonia.  Tonia and I are exactly one week apart in age (she being the older), and as she was also around fairly often when we were younger, we were always teased about having crushes on each other.  I can't speak for Tonia (although I do think it was true at one point or another), but as for myself, I think enough time has passed now that I feel comfortable admitting that it was true through junior high and into the early part of high school.  Nothing ever came of it, but we were close friends while we were in high school.  I hadn't seen her since Rachel got married a few years ago, and now she's married and pregnant.  I'm glad I could be there for everyone, and I did enjoy seeing them, despite the circumstances.  Being with everyone brought back a lot of good memories of my youth, and the time I spent with Uncle Mike and Aunt Bill, and with Uncle Clarence, Aunt Lou, and Rachel, often with Mike and Tonia.  It's really amazing to think back on times like that and think about how much stuff has changed, and how much has stayed the same.  At one point I saw Crazy Mike and Dave exchange a private joke, and just look at each other and laugh, and it reminded me so much of how it is now between me, Rachel, and Mike.  We don't see each other often, but we shared so much growing up and have so many common experiences that even now we can just exchange glances and private jokes and be right back on the same wavelength.  It all made me feel really lucky for the circumstances that allowed me to be so close to these people and consider them family even when they aren't all blood relations.  Blood is overrated.  It's shared experiences and love that makes a real family, and nothing else.  All of these people have meant so much to my life, and I'm grateful for that.  I didn't always feel lucky as a kid, but that's the nature of youth.  Now that I can look back on it I realize how great it was to be surrounded by such wonderful people.  Being there, surrounded by these people and memories for my childhood, I spent a good portion of the afternoon just cruising the streets of Troy, visiting old haunts and revisiting old times.

It's the June holidays and I'm kind of taking a little time off from my beloved blog. But anyway if there's anyone reading, today will be all about the French Open final between two wonderful players; Coria and Gaudio!  Well with all the drama and theatrics, it was absolutely impossible for me to keep away from this topic. First was the loss of a set to love by a frozen Gaudio. I kept my hopes alive of Gaudio winning, but after it reached 5-1 in the second set I thought it would be all over. But a spark can be re-lit in the presence of oxygen, I thought, and remembered how he climbed up from a 5-1 in the second against Nalbandian. For a moment that seemed to be the case, as he went up 5-3, but then he lost the set.  My Dad was saying that Gaudio did not deserve to be there, did not even deserve the challenge. My dear daddy, I thought to myself, ' In an unfair world it matters not that you deserve to be there, but that you are there!' The crowd was all behind Gaudio, and he climbed back up a set 6-4. Coria had strained a muscle, and was experiencing cramps. Huge drama it was when he was reduced to a snail's pace and lost a set!  In the final set both men were exhausted and Coria seemed to have recovered from his cramp. But anyway with crucial breaks at almost every turn, tension was high, the crowd was restless and the cheering could only be stopped by hitting a serve. All the rest was bullcrap tennis and really is not worth mentioning. Gaudio won in the end, after all his nervous laughter and his funny antics.  With all the drama and the theatrics, I believe that if I were on court that day I would win.

Some background - my sleeping patterns suck.  Sometimes, I will wake up really late on a weekend, and my only hope of normalizing my schedule is be spending all night awake.  This happened the past Sunday into Monday, and early in the morning I decided to hit IHOP for some coffee.  I was planning on just reading some  De Trinitate , but a group of undergrads next to me was deeply involved in political conversation (which perked up my ears).  I could also tell their politics were a weeeee bit different than mine (I was glad to be informed that all Republicans are racist sexists....all this time, I didn't realize I was a mysoginist racialist.  Who knew?).  They got on the topic of gay marriage, and I found myself getting involved.  Soon after, a rather rude associate of theirs came up.  That's when things got interesting.  I was mostly speaking to a fellow named Mark, a rather intelligent-seeming fellow, atheist, liberal, and aspiring musician.  Later on in the evening, we got into a wonderful chat about mind-body dualism.  But the main fellow was a Jordanian (the rude guy), apparently a student (couldn't tell if grad or undergrad) in one of the sciences (I believe).  He was more than willing to tell me 'the truth' about the world, as Americans are apparently terribly uninformed.  I should have known - after all, Jordan is so well-known for its freedom of dissent and open political system....oh, wait.  You remember those scenes of some happy Iraqis, when the US troops came in?  Turns out, they weren't Iraqis - just Moroccans shipped in by the US for PR purposes.  Also, apparently for Arabs, the Saddam system was good.  I asked whether any system that involves random execution and wives being raped would be prefered by anyone, in which case he said the Arabs are different.  Whether the Shites would agree they are  that  different, I wonder.  Then said that all those horror stories were made up AND are actually being perpetrated on the ground by the US right now.  It gets better.  Naturally, of course, this comes back to oil, and to Zionism.  To oil - he gave the usual rendition of the Iraq-war-was-for-Cheney's-oil-buddies argument, which has always confused me.  We are talking about a dreadfully Machiavellian plot, filled with intrigue to satisfy the most base urges.  As doing something like that would be impeachable (if not executable as treason), one would think that it should be under wraps.  Instead, everyone from Senator Kennedy to all raving lunatics with an IP addresses have caught the kabbal red-handed.  You would think the CEOs would plan this better.  But then, there's Zionism, the dread Jewish plot.  Apparently, Israel has the US 'by the balls,' in the phrase of the Jordanian.  Never did find out how (perhaps the Jews have just entrenched themselves in the government, you know, when they're not busy poisoning wells or sacrificing children and all that).  But, it is for the best, as apparently the US has unprecedented control of the world - I was told that we could order India to march through China (with the ChiComs' consent) to take out North Korea.  Or, just fake another 9/11, this time in China, to get them to see the light.  Why do I present all this?  Because this guy didn't seem like your typical anti-Semite conspiracy theory nut, as the stereotype goes.  He was educated.  He was well-traveled.  And yet, he spoke like someone who wears tinfoil on his head to keep the government from reading his mind.  And, if in some regions of the world, the educated talk like this, what about the uneducated?  I read today that apparently, a few years back,  Mein Kampf  made #6 for best-sellers in Palestine.  God help us if that demonic text is coming back into fashion, and if that is part and parcel of educated discourse over there.  I doesn't have to be that way.  Perhaps some regions would be better served reading the peaeceful works of someone like Gulen (a Turkish Muslim who really has pushed for the idea of 'Islam = Peace').  We can hope they will.  But, after the Jordanian left, I asked Mark if I had guessed right, and that our mutual chatting partner was a conspiratorialist.  He said yes, but that he tended to see conspiracies around as well.  Perhaps conspiracies serve for the educated what superstition served for the uneducated centuries ago - bringing order to chaos, no matter how ridiculous it sounds.\n\nText 2:Reception was well.  As one friend of mine used to say, 'the wine flowed like....well, wine.'  Conversation, as always, was a bit odd.  I think a group of us spent about twenty minutes in debate regarding which James Bond films were the best (it started over an argument about Sean Connery vs. Roger Moore).  But one thing was clear - best Bond girl?  Diana Rigg - Bond's wife in the tragically-ended 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service.'  Also, the guy who played Bond in that one (his only time in the role) had the best turn-and-fire at the film's beginning (you know, where you see Bond through the rifling and such): apparently, he has the best footing for opening fire.  A shame the rest of the movie is so comparatively dry (they even had a good villian - who wants to face off with Kojak?).  Aren't you glad that academics discuss such deep and meaningful topics?  After that, the grad students and profs ended up talking amongst their respective groups.  We students ended up talking about theology, religion, the Bible, and Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ.'  Beats me what the professors were chatting about.  When one of us went to get another drink, a prof asked her if we were still talking about Bond and such.  She said we were talking about the Bible.  His response: 'You mean, like the Scriptures and stuff?'  She asked if he'd like to join in....turned it down.  Ah, the difference in generations.

Some argue this is a good thing because people will immerse themselves in what they want to read/listen to/watch without worrying about the cultural implications, but others say the phenomenon hurts culture at large because middlebrow consumers are not exposed to, and therefore interested in, elements of highbrow media and entertainment.

I had dinner and stayed at my aunt and uncle's place. It was a nice evening, because I got drunk from a continuous flow of wine and passed out at 7:30 PM.  Thursday: I spent most of the day alone at my aunt and uncle's place quietly reading. I got a lot of work done. I now have a better idea about what to write for one of my papers now. My aunt took me to Fuddruckers for lunch and later that night we went to a little Japanese restaurant in Ridgewood for some sashimi.  Now playing: Eddie Money - 'Shakin''  Friday: I got back up to NYC a bit too early Friday morning. So I hung out at the weird Burger King next to the Port Authority. It's weird, because I always see interesting people go in and out of it. Also when I was hanging out outside waiting for Melissa, I saw a voodoo lady, interesting bums, and some slutty looking chicks. Anyway, eventually Melissa and I met up and then she showed me the sights of Flushing. Melissa, Becky, and I wandered around a cemetary, got gyros, got tea and went to CBGBs. There was a lot of hilarity that continued until late night.  CBGBs was cool, but had over priced beer. $6.25 for a bottle of Heineken, meant that the coolness wore off as the beer wore off. This and Detox Darlings weren't bad, but were trying to live in the 80s a bit too hard.  Now playing: Smashing Pumpkins - 'Sweet Sweet'  Saturday: We got some bagels from the infamous Bagel Oasis that morning and then saw some virtual dragonboating. We also hung out with my cousin Kelly for a bit before I took a Greyhound back to Binghamton.   There was more hilarity on Saturday too, but it's hard to describe. I had a lot of fun.  I stopped by a GSO downtown before going home. Got myself a few free slices of pizza, beer, and wine. It wasn't that great.  Sunday: So far today I've done my laundry, saw  Old School , and got some Burger King.

ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Larry Lashway.  It reviews the job of the superintendent in a world of raised accountability.  From the ERIC Digest:  To outsiders, the role of the school superintendent has always been a little mystifying. Most people can explain that the superintendent is the ultimate 'person in charge,' but what superintendents actually do remains vague.   In truth, superintendents themselves may sometimes wonder. Their once imposing authority has eroded considerably in the last several decades. State and federal policymakers have not hesitated to impose major mandates on districts, and a variety of special-interest groups have become assertive about advancing their agenda through the schools. Parents and teachers are more inclined to demand a seat at the decision-making table, and a growing number of charter schools are public but not fully answerable to the district. Most of all, standards-based accountability has made reform not just the trademark of progressive superintendents but a minimum expectation for the job.   How are superintendents responding to their changed environment? What leadership strategies are they using? Is the superintendency in a state of crisis, as some assert, or is it just adapting to fit the times? This Digest examines those questions.\n\nText 2:Great! things to read this summer so we won't ever get bored, eh? Hehe.. but, but I have to say, I'm looking forward to this.

A very funny piece of what an AA meeting might sound like if it were  urlLink 'Grad. Students Anonymous'  instead. That it was written by two tenured professors at Amherst College lends, I think, a bit of credibility to it - we can see that even people who have 'made it' went through this kind of crippling angst.  It seems that everything I read about the life of grad students and young phd's is a lot like what I hear about young associates, an endless stream of complaints, regrets, and warnings. But surely  some  abd's and phd's must lead fulfilling lives. Maybe it's selection bias. After all, the  urlLink Chronicle of Higher Education  seems to be a repository of bitching and moaning from humanities students and part-time faculty, presumably because the science grad students and full time faculty have better things to do with their times. The possibility of careers in industy is like a valve that takes some of the pressure out of the academic pipeline for science phd's, but I imagine that physicists, mathematicians, and everyone else interested in basic research are competing for very few spots in academia also. Maybe it's something about the temperment of those drawn to graduate programs in philosophy, history, and the granddaddy of them all, English, that leads to all this agonizing.   Or maybe it is just the reality of the phd program and the job market. One thing I hear a lot about is the pressure to write about the most esoteric and irrelevant topics for your dissertation because it is only on the extreme margins that a lowly grad student with limited funds and time can hope to contribute something new enough to qualify as original research. My favorite professor from college is writing about some really interesting and at least somewhat topical stuff now, but did his dissertation on 'hermeneutics' or some other such word that I can neither spell nor define.   Still, I'm indulging my ivory-tower fantasies for the time being. I'm taking the GRE's at the end of May, and am preparing to apply to the PhD program in political science at Harvard during my 1L year at the law school.   With a some luck and hard work, who knows, I may emerge from school a little older, a little more cynical, a lot more debt-ridden, and a lot less employable.

Like I had forgotten something. And then it hit me.  Besides this week being the 10th anniversary of the first time Mark Mothasemi and I took to the stage with the teenage versions of Ash and Tom, a year ago this past weekend, the aggression played what will be most likely be their last ever show. From what I recall, it was a good gig, though honestly, we were always good (though we got REALLY good once Robin came in). We played here in the City and the other band no showed, so we were able to do our extended set without having to cut anything. it was sparsely attended, especially in comparison to our previous NYC shows, but it was hastily put together and we had just come back from Russia when the opportunity to play arose. While we had several gigs over the past 10 years that were supposed to be our last, the one time I didn't think was the last one, was in fact, THE LAST GIG EVER (TM). I've not seen a video of this gig because, according to Matt Gentile, the tape is 'fucked up'. I nag him occasionally about this, but there's a romanticism to never seeing it  I always felt like the aggression should have gone out like the end of Michael Mann's HEAT, in an overblown blaze of glory. That gig has been played over and over in my head millions of times. From what I would wear to what I would play, the gig was preconceived for the past few years. I don't think I was alone in that as I recall Ash having a set list for such a gig (as well as several drafted letters of resignation).  I was about to share with you my thoughts on what that gig should be. I've decided against it as I think what you are speculating might be better than what I had planned.   I thought I would be more emotional about it, but I guess I got over it more quickly than I anticipated. This could be because I remain in such close,  daily, contact with the people who did matter and worked hard to make the aggression something special. Another reason, and I can see this with time having passed, I was fucking miserable in the band thanks to the lack of focus and maturity within it. But if I am anything, I am loyal and I was the general who took the ship down to a noble death.  Let's be frank, we only sold a few thousand records, we were never even a blip on a radar. However, for ten years it was the world I and a few others lived in and while I can never forgive the few who tried to fuck with it,  I love that the music and the experiences will be something no one can ever take away or tarnish. I wanted to save the industrial scene when bands i adored like Chemlab and Skinny Puppy went away. With all of these old schoolers coming back and putting out records, I can rest easier knowing we kept our elders seats warm in their absence.   From the pits of the Underworld to the former Soviet Union, the casualty rate was shockingly low and most of the friendships remain intact. Plus, some records came out that I love to pieces. They proudly hang on my well as reminders of the wonderful life I have led for 10 years.  And don't think I don't seen the irony in the fact that the one of last songs the aggression ever played was in fact, Hypefactor's SWEETEST SOUL.  HAH.  F\n\nText 2:Matt is obviously poopy from the lack of aggression in his life, so let me tell you about the Skinny Puppy shows. The fact of the matter is, as Irene put it, this was a 'reunion' show and no matter how much we loved this kind of stuff back in the day, and I was fortunate enough to see Puppy in 1992 (the best year ever), whatever we were about to see in 2004 just wasn't going to be the same thing. For some, like my significant other, this make the show skippable. For me, I can appreciate the challenge that was laying ahead for Mssrs. Key and Ogilvie.  Most of my interest in this was helped by the fact that the new album is really good. I respect their NOT going back and doing something they had done before (screw you diehards), so I expected them to do something different live. The quick comparison: Puppy was very performance art based in the old days, tons of props, big set, etc, which you could pull off back then without losing your shirt. in 2004, its impossible to pull off a big stage show, so the emphasis was focused on musical performance and to that effect, a guitarist/bassist was added as well as a drummer, while Mr. Key manned the keyboards. Honestly, I think that his moving from drums (he is amazing) to keyboards was perhaps the only true error of this tour. His style is unique and while I'm not knocking the drummer they had (he too was amazing), it did take away from their particular sound.  It seems I have spoken negative about this, but quite honestly, I had a blast, especially the first night. In an unusual move for me, I avoided reading about setlists, so I went into it all fresh. it was an open book for me. They played a great range of material spanning their whole career, including gems like GLASS HOUSES, TIN OMEN, TESTURE and INQUISITION, and other 'hits'. I was impressed by the way the music was presented and I thought the live versions, particularly of the olders stuff like SMOTHERED HOPE, were sharp without insulting the original versions. I would like to note that Ash marked out like a maniac at this gig, which is a big compliment. Also, we got TWO encores at this gig, which I'm told is very rare on this tour. By the time I left the first night, I was pumped to see it again.  The second night was interesting in that its like seeing a movie you really liked for the second time and you find things you like even more and now a few things you didnt like as much. But nothing I hated and I wasn't as excited as I was the first night, obviously, but it allowed me to appreciate the show more. I had heard from TODD RYAN (I spell his name in caps, so you can all yell at him), that Puppy had rehearsed 18 different set lists, but the set list was pretty much the same the second night. We stood in a different spot and got a better view than the night before, so it was fun to watch even more. Ogre's voice was much better the second night, and the music seemed tighter, but the crowd and the vibe was lacking the second night.   However, just when I was ready to get myself a drink, out of nowhere they brought out Grandpa Al to guest on TIN OMEN. It was 1992 (the best year ever) all over again. I don't think Al was plugged in, and he seemed quite zombified (and industrial Ozzy), but the idea of Al guesting with Puppy after all these years on a classic song he helped produce was enough for the crowd to lose their shit and for the 19 year old in me to flash a wide smile. It may not have been a classic performance, but it was certainly a classic moment. And in this day and age, a classic moment here and there with our old heroes is good enough...even if they look like theyre straight out of WEEKEND AT BERNIES.  F"], "gold_label": 1.0}

She stammered as he sauntered away from her. With nothing on apart from his denim jeans, he gave Emma an ideal opportunity to gaze at his perfectly sculpted body, his washboard abs and masculine six pack. Emma sighed softly to herself as Shane looked back long enough to throw the syringe her in direction.  She scampered like a hungry child to the needle. As the pin stabbed her skin, Emma closed her eyes and heard the front door shut in Shane's wake. She let the syringe fall, empty, to the floor and lay back on the bed where she and Shane had been, minutes ago.  She felt strange, suddenly, as if the world were spinning and then not. Opening her eyes, Emma couldn't focus on anything around her and eventually gave up, closing her eyes again. She began to enjoy the sensations running through her body as a small smile crept over her face as unconsciousness crashed towards her.  'Emma?' She heard someone calling her name, someone female and unfamiliar. Emma opened one eye doubtfully and looked around. Her apartment was like a junk yard and went unnoticed as she saw a tall, confident woman standing in the doorway of her bedroom door. 'Who the hell are you?' Emma slurred.  'Don't you remember? It's me, Alana.' Alana stepped into the depth of Emma's bedroom and noticed the unused condom wrappers around the bed. 'What are you doing here?' Emma asked bitterly. 'I was worried about you,' Alana sighed, 'So I thought I'd stop by.'  'I thought that was against regulations.' Emma spat sarcastically. 'It is. But I'm putting my neck on the line for you.' Alana sat hesitantly on the edge of Emma bed and reached out to put her hand on Emma's leg. Emme kicked her away and rolled over. She wasn't sure how long she'd been out, but she was certain she needed a cigarette.  Inhaling deeply, Emma glared angirly at Alana. 'I'm fine. You can see that, can't you?' Emma challenged. Alana shook her head. 'I wish there was more I could do to help you, Emma. But I can't help you unless you help yourself.' She stood up and gave Emma one final, sad look before turning and walking away. Emma smirked triamphantly to herself.

Except that I don't drink alcohol mainly because the stuff I do drink is never at the parties we go to. I am what some of my sisters uni mates call a 'mature drinker' because I drink stuff like JD and Coke or champagne. I don't like the cheaper alcopops and things. I can see why Jackie drinks and I think teh way she drinks is fine. She has a few but never enough to make her tipsy or anything more. I don't have a problem with people like that I just don't like folk getting drunk because its just plain stupid. Back to the example of Andy - missed his own party. Jenny at his party, threw up everywhere and probably felt like shit the next day liek most who got pissed. Its dumb. You can't remember it so whats the point in even going? Our leavers ball - it was mainly the popular or tarty lot that were drunk, they can't remember half of it. Our lot: no alcohol, just high on the buzz of the evening and we can remember every precious moment. Glad Dave's party was good. I spent the evening doing bloody homework because I was given way to much to do. I mean its half term for goodness sake, its a holiday. We should be relaxing, getting our systems back to their full potential not running them down further by working. Its not even as if I actually went away on holiday. I spent a few days on the geology trip which was doing geology work so that is fair enough, then two days with my sister at her uni who I haven't seen since she went which again is fair enough. I think family comes before college. I wouldn't be suprised if I told the teachers 'I haven't had time to do the work because I was in hospital after being a car accident' and even if it was true they would still yell at me.  I am sick of life right now. I mean is it really worth all this?

My aunty used to give me umbongo cartoons cos I loved the advert on the Tv and i can still remember the pictures, but I can't remember the words! Aww. Just been looking at all our family photos from when we were really young and stuff, quite funny cos I was the fattest little child with the most awful hair ever, and i was always covered in food! lol, not much's changed then! Well work today was fun, Tina bought her daughter Kinnou in who is three, and she is sooo sweet! She's got cerebal palsy which means she is quite backward (being brain damaged), she is very very tiny and she can't talk properly, but she is such a happy and cheeky child it is soo funny! She was driving Tina beserk today cos she was tripping up all the customers cos she's so small and doesn't register what's going on around her, and then having sung happy birthday to herself and been told off by a customer for making too much noise (jokinlgy), she ran round and round the shop screaming it at him, following him everywhere, and then stood in the doorway and screamed it a t him as he walked off up the road, then turned around and burst out laughing- she is soo cheeky cos she knows she's been naughty! Anyway, to keep her out of the customers' way I tried to get her to help me dust the shelves, by giving her all the products and getting her to line them up on the floor. This was fine for a while until she decided she wanted to help me take stuff off the shelves too, so I gave her the small stuff to do because she can't managed anything else. She was taking the little liquid ant killer tubes off the shelf, and dropping them down onto the floor, and then she stepped forawrd to try and rech the ones at the back, and trood on the reast of the ant liquid tubes, and they exploded everywhere, covering the floor, my trousers and her ickly feet in sticky ant killer stuff.

I have a dark past. I used to listen to pop rap. Yup. I who worship Nine Inch Nails and the Beastie Boys, once owned two tapes by marky mark and the funky bunch. I also had vanilla ice's first album, and I was way into the fat boys. I'm over that now (thank {your deity here}), but I have a new vice - Cover songs. I don't know what it is, but I really love it when a group takes a classic song and perverts it just the right way. Marilyn Manson's 'Sweet Dreams' and 'I put a spell on you', The Mighty Mighty Bosstones 'Detroit Rock City' and 'Enter Sandman' (and I don't even like the bosstones. at all),  anything like that, I love it. Music I DO NOT enjoy: teeny pop, country, whiny alternative garbage. pretty much anything written before 1980 (and most of what was written in the 80s), manufactured bands (like n*stync, backdoor boys, and the countless other new kids/menudo clones) britney spears (both personally and musically - I hope she gets attacked by killer bees and stumbles into traffic, where she would be run over by christina aguilera's tour bus, which would then careen off a cliff, exploding in a glorious fireball upon impact with the cold hard ground.) christina aguilera (she learned spanish so she could record a spanish language album because she wanted to be true to her roots. her roots are in new england) and I'm not too fond of the elevator music crap that people like enya keep oozing all over us. ok, feeling better now. I got some rare old anthrax off napster (gives finger to 'The Man') so I'm great. Speaking of napster, it's nice to see the true artists coming out in favor of napster. most artists are pretty neutral on napster (the 'who gives a shit?' attitude is cool), some are really pissed off about napster (not to name any names *COUGH*metallica*COUGH*), and are trying to get it banned. those artists are money hungry, and not interested in making music for the sake of making music. and then there are some artists (Like prince and rage against the machine and chuck d and offspring and limp bizkit) who actually like napster, and encourage it's use. rage against the machine's management actually banned some users, so RATM apologized by offering a bunch of cool music on their website (to make up for some of their fans being denied the music they wanted). uh, what was I talking about?....

This past week I have been so...unlike me...it is kinda crazy.  I mean, it started with the whole talking to him thing...which happened twice...and then on Thursday (I think it was) Christina was talking to me about the date auction and when I made the argument that I am not the type of person that likes standing up in front of a large group she was like, 'But you need to conquer your fears!' and that is when it hit me that I was being a chickenshit again, just like I always am, and I thought about how Abby and Fifer had that pact.   Soooo I agreed to do it.  Ah ha ha.  AND I am going to do it by myself.  Other ppl are auctioning themselves off in groups but I, Lisa, insisted on being up there by myself because this is a new chapter in my life (so sad I didn't get to end the old one in a certain ironic way, eh Fifer?).   At the Dessert and Discourse last night about objectivity/subjectivity in the arts, I spoke up THREE times, despite my irrational fear of speaking in front of large groups.  And one time I made a very viable point in the discussion.  Twas great.  I am tired of being the quiet shy girl.  From now on I am not going to be afraid of talking or introducing myself to people, or anything!!  Mua ahjahahahahahaha!!!  The other night I was at an Astronomy Club meeting and a few of them were talking about Bush's plan to give more funding to NASA and so I was like, 'Oh pleasseee, he just did that to get the nerds to vote for him!' and then I looked around and was like...er...crap.  I was talking to a guy with floppy hair, glasses, and pants that when he sat down went half way up his calves, a girl with red pig tails, freckles, and glasses, and a small Asian kid that hardly ever talks.  They all looked at me for a second, and the guy said something that sounded like an agreement maybe and then they went back to talking.  I felt really bad.  They didn't look like they minded that much, and I realize that coming to our school, everyone must be a nerd in some way, but they have probably been teased their whole lives.  Maybe I should have said to get the intellectually motivated population of America to vote for him.  Oh and now there is a couch war between us and the guys.  It is pretty funny.  I saw Mike and this other Asian kid steal the couch that we have on our floor the other day so I put up a flyer that said 'MISSING COUCH' and they took it down and then Nicola brought it up at our 'town meeting' and the next day it went missing from the boys' floor.  So they put up their own flyer...of no creativity, it basically said what mine said...anyway, it is quite interesting.  So this is gonna sound kinda weird, but TAMS really is beginning to feel like home.  It is like everybody knows everybody else and in some kind of weirddd way, we are like one really big family of intellectually motivated kids.  I just realized this week how much it is gonna suck to graduate...or closer, when the seniors this year graduate.  Hudgens and Mordechai are two of the most interesting people I have ever met.  Hmm...  I am really worried for Jennifer.  Fifer and I were over at their house and her dad and mom went freakin psycho again, and I didn't want to leave, but we kinda had to, and when we came back her car wasn't there but it wasn't at my house or Nick's house either and I have no idea where else she would have gone...I need o go see if she is at work today.

And now...The Friday Five brought to you in part by DJS Industries, a subsidiary of the Soft Drink corporation.    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?   It's short, but kind of long on top right now.  I don't know that it's necessarily wavy or curly, but it's thick.  It's like a goddamn brillo pad.    2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  The biggest thing I notice is that I've gotten a lot more gray hair over the last 5 years or so.  I'm only 30 years old, but I fear that by the time I reach 40, I'll look like Phil Donohue.  I guess I can be grateful that I won't ever, ever, ever be bald.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?   As low-maintenance as possible.  I'm a guy for Christ's sake.  I don't need to mess with that kind of shit.  I do hate it when it gets too long.  You see, I'm cursed with a large head (physically, you twits) and when my hair (thick hair) gets long, my head size grows exponentially.  That's when I need to cut 'er down, yo.    4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?   The gray would be gone.  Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.  Well...maybe a cowlick or two would get outta my sight.  Sometimes I get the Alfalfa thing going on in the back.    5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?   I had some broad in high school cut my hair for me.  She had a shaver but no guards.  I told her 'who cares, cut it anyway.'  She applied the shaver to my head and slipped.  Bzzzzzzzzzzzt!  There was a three inch bald spot in front of my ear.  I shrugged and said 'well, you might as well make it even.'  This was back in the mullet days, so she proceded to shave the side of my hair, leaving it long in front and long in back.  I looked like some kind of crazed Indian brave with a thick mohawk.

The sister came down for the weekend so I spent Friday night, Saturday evening, Sunday morning and Sunday evening over at the Mom's visiting. As an added bonus a good friend the college days was in town from NYC. So a bunch of us Virginia Tech Photo Staff kids got caught up over pizza in Cleveland Park, DC. Easter Sunday was nice. We did brunch with some relatives, and then that evening the family & my girlfriend did Easter dinner at my Mom's. Dinner consisted of steaks wrapped in bacon, twice-cooked potatoes, lobster tail, corn on the cob and pie. A mighty feast. Saturday night's Yo La Tengo show blew. I was so disappointed. I don't really like the new album and they played nearly every song from it unfortunately.  YLT seems to be forgoing thier earlier noise-pop and lounge sensibilities for making music that is so quiet and docile that it barley registers as sound. Plus, the lyrics for this new album are just terrible; crossing over the line of a song-as-personal-confession to sounding like it was culled from the poetry of a thousand 13-year-old pop-star crushes.  Trying to recreate the 'hushed' sounds of the album in a live setting was such a waste of the bands extraordinary talents and the very notion of a 'performance'. In one of the few critical reviews I read, it was suggested that the new album is the sound of the band decomposing. And sadly, I have to agree.  I could go on & on, but I'm testing the idea of going to bed at decent hour so I'm rested for a full day of work. heh\n\nText 2:Like Day & Night   As predicted the weekend was a bustle of wedding activity - both of the successful kind and, sadly, utter crap.  Saturday day and Saturday evening were black and white in terms of accomplishing tasks.  Saturday day was the good part. We: Bought wedding or shower gifts for our friend's weddings. Picked up my wedding ring. Dawn shopped for summer clothes; I took a nap in the sun at an outdoor mall. Returned unwanted merchandise for refunds F found bathing suits she liked... but...  Saturday evening was a whole other story (the bad kind) We were prevented from purchasing bathing suits with Macy's credit card because the idiot behind the counter gave up and collapsed on the floor the moment his cash register confused him. The jeweler were I purchased F's wedding ring delivered to us the wrong ring.   To their credit they handled the event professionally with little fuss over correcting the order. Sunday was mostly a bust but there's not point in me complaining even further. I'm sure everyone is tired of me whining.  It was refreshing to have Monday off from work. There I said something nice!

I can appreciate being included in the decision-making process if that does factor at all in her intentions, but C'MON...I can't tell you how it annoys the shit out of me to be bombarded with 8 questions about something that hasn't even been discussed in any detail with the client and she's asking these questions because she's not confident in being able to meet the client's expectations and she thinks they will leave us. She has no foresight to capture the essence of what the client wants if she can't include every component the client mentions in a brain-storm session.

Besides Cyrus & Daniel, only a few other college students and a bearded, potbellied, Star Wars-shirt-wearing thirtysomething stood in line.  Conversation was sparse.  The employees let us into the theater at 9:00.  After we saved our seats, some of us sat in the brighter lit areas to read.  I found it a difficult to concentrate because of the atmosphere, so I started to convrse with others in our group. Surprisingly, people didn't begin to trickle in until around 10:15.  The first and only group of costumed fans didn't even enter until 10:30. Nonetheless, by 11 pm the main part of the theater was reasonably filled, and the room was abuzz with impatient chatter.  Even though the theater had 4 screens showing the movie, I'd have to admit that there were a lot of people in ours...  this movie was big.  As for the movie itself, I'd have to say that it was the stuff that Star Wars fans dream of.  I won't give any spoilers, but it definitely had a lot of subtle hints and nuances that only a Star Wars nerd like I could appreciate.  In no way do I say this in an elite-ist manner; au contrair, it shows how much time I spent watching the movies, reading the books, etc. It was a very fun movie, and I liked it a lot more than the Phantom Menace.  However, once again my fears were confirmed.  If you've seen Star Wars and Episode One and compare them to the Empire Strikes Bad and The Return of the Jedi, you will notice a slight difference in the levels of acting.  Namely, the first two mentioned had the worse line readings and direction... and, they were the ones directed by Lucas himself.  Well, walking into this movie, I feared that the same problem would plague this movie, and it did.  Lucas is a genius in filmmaking but definitely not in directing people.  It wasn't bad enough to take way the joy from the movie, though.  It was fun and it definitely had its moments, I'd have to admit.  5/16/2002  Tonight Hope Chapel people rented out two karaoke rooms.  The horror, the hilarity... the horror.  As my first evening of karaoke dragged on, I tried to enjoy myself by singing some songs I knew.  To some degree, I did have some fun, but something kept bothering me.  Some of the songs we sang were of such deep meaning and whatnot, but they were being butchered and sung for shallow entertainment... and I think it really took away from the songs.  For example, singing 'Zombie' by The Cranberries did NOT work... lyrics wailing anger concerning the violence in Ireland did not fit the atmosphere at all.  The only thing that made the night redeemable was James Lieu's R&B skills... he sure made the night fun.  I have a lot to say about the subject, but I'm too tired."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I am trying to eat like my trainer said for me to eat.  Lots of protien and less carbohydrates.  Really?  Why don't you just tell me to take less breaths of air and work on sleeping only 2 hours a week.  Carbohydrates are my friend, and I want them to be in my life (and stomach) forever.  So my chicken is in the background right now, cooking itself to go into my carb-starved tummy.  I wonder if when I meet with him next (tomorrow) he'll somehow be able to tell by looking at me that I shoved half of a cheese pizza in my mouth last night, followed by a bag of chocolate covered raisins at a movie.  All of this happening well past 7pm (which is when I have to have. my last carbohydrate eaten for the day.  Yeah, snacking on 'protiens' after7pm isn't fun.  I'm sure it's perfectly socially acceptable to wander into a movie and eat a t-bone or a chicken breast instead of popcorn.  Why not?  Mmm actually that whole-wheat-tortilla-fajita wasn't that bad.  Reminds me of the time I ate dirt on accident with a lil' salsa on the side.  My home phone is ringing but I don't answer it anymore.  I've decided that I will only use my cell phone.  I removed all features such as caller ID, call waiting, and so on from my home line.  I kind of like hearing it ring, knowing someone is trying to get ahold of me and can't.  Call the cell, jackasses.  Did you know that Stacy's Mom Has Got It Going On?  Apparently her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and they're like 'it's better than yours.'  It's weird, I know.  I don't really understand why she's got milkshakes in the yard.  I picture them melting pretty fast, afterall it has to be hot outside to want to drink a milkshake.  It's crazy to think that there are people out there with real talent, and then crap makes it onto the radio.  Oh, and then there's Creed.  Yep, Creed.  I'll go there, I'll bring it up.  I'm sure they're talented, more talented than the milkshake bitch, but c'mon.  Watching Creed (that's what I call the lead singer because I don't care to remember his name) fall off cliffs in leather pants is getting old.  Speaking of cliffs, that's one thing I would not do.  Well on purpose anyway, you know the whole bungy thing.  I don't even think I spelled it right, THAT'S how much I don't want to do it.. I can't even bring myself to spell it right.  Do people even bungy jump off of cliffs?  Well regardless, I don't think I'll be trying that anytime soon.  I'm scared of everything.\n\nText 2:Yo, Where You At?   Hey Pandies...it's long lost Bass Babe. Where have you been Bass Babe? one might ask. Well, I've also been suffering from the Blogger Blues and haven't felt like posting while I sort out my Jerry Springer-esque personal life. It's been a tough couple months but I think I've finally reached the clearing. No one has stolen my bike and I have a new gig to look forward to this evening. ;) (Shout out to Duf Fer!) So here's the Friday Five comin at 'ya.    1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   Dishes. I have a dishwasher, but I even hate doing the minimal dishwashing like when I cook something in a big pot. I also dislike unloading the clean dishes into their respective cabinets or drawers. Laundry also ranks up there because it's time consuming.    2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   I don't mind vacuuming and cleaning out my closet of all the clothes I don't wear anymore. I just did this recently and it was pretty great to downsize by 7 grocery bags full of clothing!    3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   Just clean as needed.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   Nothing odd. Just make sure the kitchen is clean.    5. What was the last thing you cleaned?  My bathroom and kitchen before I went out of town last weekend. I, like Panda, enjoy coming home to a clean apt."], "gold_label": 0.0}

God, forgive us that we've imprisoned your grace in a jail of rules; forgive us that we've traded our freedom for slavery, your mercy for our merit.&nbsp; take us back to the place of our inability, back to the place where you took God's judgment for us, that we might live and not die.&nbsp;    'for the wages of sin is death,  but  the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.' -Romans 6:23\n\nText 2:i've decided to match people up with songs... so lets see:  abby: boom i f***ed your boy friend tahnee: i like big butts jesse: aquarius amber: its raining men david: milkshake melissa:  alan: i wanna be sedated danny: she thinks my tractors sexy amanda y: all that jazz sarah: it's my life aj: im too sexy mikhail:  don: funk soul brother   ya, ill finish later (feel free to make suggestions)"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Another interesting thing I discovered today: Social Concerns is the theology class I'm taking right now.  We study the Catholic Social Teachings. Today we were talking about societal attitudes toward the elderly, and came to the topic of why people find it neccessary to dye their hair so the grey doesn't show.  I made the point that things like wrinkles and grey hairs are physical evidence that we are growing older, and the older we come, the closer to death we come...  People are afraid of death, and so they erase these reminders of their mortality with dyes and plastic surgeries. Then my mind sort of dropped out of the discussion and continued on its own.  The theory of time and its relativity has always been obvious to me in my life.  Those minutes in the classroom on a Friday afternoon really do last for hours, relatively.  There is no constant of time.  My life is like one of those commercials where falling papers are frozen in mid-air, but the actors continue to move.

It's kinda fun not to have pain shooting through my right arm and lower back. (I am in desperate need of a new computer chair that will allow for less painful computer time)   Honors convocation was last night. We had an interesting mix of family members. Abby's parents, my parents, Paula, Tricia, and the every lovely Jim, Beth and Robin (er...Rene...whatever dude) Slightly stressful, though we did have a facinating conversation with Tricia and Paula. Who knew they'd get along. ;)  All and all, I'm feeling better about life. Not that I'm no longer stressed or anything helpful like that...but I have a better sense of things and that, well, that they matter. I've been floating along in life the past few weeks, not really caring what happens or placing any real attachment to what and who is part of my everyday existence. It's hard to explain really. It's depression, but not quite. Certainly I've been in much deeper in life...so I hesitate to actually label what I'm experiencing. In the end...know the cloud is lifting.\n\nText 2:I've spent the last, oh, hour or so reading other people's blogs. I have come to the conclusion that mine is wholly inadequate. Of course, there isn't any other conclusion I could come to when reading blogs at 2am...but I know that...so I spose that's good. Anyway...figured I'd write here to uh...sound deep or something...

Enjoy!  Just gonna post a few of my more favorite pictures.    This first pic is closer to the top of the trail I took, from 'Upper Pines' Campground, past the two falls, then up John Muir to Half Dome.  This is actually coming back down, and is of a  urlLink nice wooded trail  - #1 or #2 on my list of favorite pics.  This second picture was also taken on the way down (as with all my pics) - close to one of the two falls (I forget which) was this scenic  urlLink rock wall .  Psh, whatever, I like it.  :b  Third pic is a layout of one of the falls - the  urlLink frozen water  on the side of the falls was pretty cool.  I can just imagine the first freeze of the year for this, must be totally beautiful.   The final picture I'm posting here is potentially my favorite.  Interestingly enough this was taken on my drive OUT of the park on Saturday.  I was paying more attention than I normally do and saw this  urlLink serene river  right off the side of the road, so I parked the car, jumped out, jumped a fence, and snapped this one.  Came out pretty good IMO.  All things considered, a kick ass trip.  Froze my ass off, busted up my achilles on my 18 mile (round trip) hike up to, and back from Half Dome.  The drive to and fro wasn't too bad, about 6 going up, 7 coming back.  Net net net, already thinking of planning a summer trip.  Though the cold didn't bother me so much as to not do another winter trip, 1) I'd like to bring someone with me next time, 2) I hear there's a better 'party scene' in the summer and 3) I'd like to be able to go with less clothing (not 15 layers).  Until then...\n\nText 2:FA: OSX's very own stevej took issue with my Chimera/Blogger chide a few posts back and investigated: the posting bug is with  urlLink Chimera's  USER_AGENT string and evidently it will be fixed in v2.4.

The desire to hurt something has come back.  I have been desperately searching for one tiny, inconsequential little piece of paper that I knew I had handed off to someone at least 4 weeks ago.  He, in turn, handed it over to someone else for further processing.  Last week, I was asked about the status of that unimportant little piece of paper - since it was responsible for paying for the entire 4 day stay for a guest travelling from Europe, containing her credit card number, authorization for charges and approval from her bank!    NO ONE COULD FIND THE DAMN THING!  I asked again, please check again and again.  I really don't want to contact this guest and say, 'Oh. Sorry. Yeah, we lost that.  Hope you don't start finding weird charges on your card.  If you do, we had nothing to do with it!'  So, I asked one more time.  And I asked someone else this time, because I wanted to look myself.  Before I had the chance to look myself, this wonderful person informs me that he found the authorization right where it was supposed to be.    SO WHY DIDN'T THE ONE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DAMNED LITTLE SLIP OF PAPER KNOW WHERE IT WAS?  A week of fretting and worrying over nothing.   No wonder my eye is ticking along at a regular clip today.  Grrrrrrrrr!  Diva out.\n\nText 2:So, today was interesting.  I worked from 7-3 which was kinda fun because the first 4 hours went by so quickly but then my entire body was aching from literally giving everything I had at the tennis tournament yesterday.  After work I went to the horse handling classes at the All Star center.  I really enjoy working with horses.  With dogs and cats, when you talk to them, they usually just look at you as if you are speaking some foreign language or something.  However, when you talk to horses, they look at you seeming to say 'Yes, I understand what you are saying, and i sympathize with you.'  There is more of a connection I guess.  And it is just really cool working with animals three times my size.  After the classes I came home and hung out with my family for a bit.  It was Matthew's birthday so we all had cake and his girlfriend came over and we watched some Japanese extreme sports or something...it was pretty funny.  Then I went to my dad's house.  I feel really bad.  Tonight his cousin Keith was over there with his 20-year-old daughter, Andrea.  Well, Andrea is gorgeous, and she has been gogeous for as long as I can remember.  She's always had all these beauty pageant trophies and stuff...well, I hadn't seen her in about three years...she had changed a lot.  She smokes now and drinks a lot and has a belly button ring and a tattoo...all of which does not detract from how naturally beautiful she is, but still...well, anyway, back to why I felt bad... When Andrea left, she gave her dad a huge hug and kiss on the cheek and said 'I love you.' and whatnot.  Now, if you know anything at all about the relationship I have with my dad, you KNOW that I am not like that.  I feel very awkward around him for the most part.  Our relationship never has been so great since I found out in the 7th grade about the crap he did to my mom.  That is when i think I started hating him.  I hated him for like a year before I finally found it in my heart to just forgive him and accept what had happened...but things are still kind of weird between us.  So, whenever I went to leave, he came over and gave me a big hug and I hugged him back, and he said, 'I love you.'  No matter how hard I try, I have not been able to say that to my dad for as long as I can remember.  Tonight was no exception.  I just said, 'See ya later.' and walked out the door.  I could feel Keith watching us and smiling in victory because him and Andrea have a good relationship.  I felt bad, but....I just can't do it...and I really hope it isn't because I don't love my dad, because I do...I think...or at least, I hope so...  Btw, Jennifer (not Lemmers in case Fifer or J-chan happens to read this one day) is making me very upset.  She threw a party Friday night and used me for a lot of stuff and THEN she tells me like five minutes before I have to leave to go there that she decided to invite Spencer (my ex) and his new girlfriend.  How nice of her.  ugh, she can be really cool, but she also knows how to be the most insensitive, annoying person.  She was so rude about it too....Must let go of resentment and remember that we are all not perfect...ok, remembering...forgiving...maybe...ahhh!!!!!!!!!  Well, anyway, I am still dead tired and it is late once again...so I will go now.  'the things you make me wanna do I'd rob a quik-e-mart for you' -the ataris  Lisa"], "gold_label": 0.0}

But Peeling and school board officials this year decided to include the final three weeks and a college course grade.'   &nbsp; Hmmm...coincidence?&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not, but I doubt I'd sue over it.&nbsp; Didn't see that the kid or his family planned to, but it was likely pressure from the other parents on behalf of their kids (and a dose of 'my kid is better than that black kid') that prompted the policy change.&nbsp; I just hope the kid, Moreko Griggs, doesn't let it detract from his accomplishments.\n\nText 2:hey, peeps.  you know what, my dear reader my friend?  i love you.  that might sound corny and/or weird and/or unrealistic, but really properly analyzed it's not.  i love all living beings on general principles.  and i recommend that as a good way to be.  what does it mean that i love you, even not particularly knowing you well?  it means that i recognize you as a precious living being, deserving of happiness and its causes and deserving to overcome suffering completely.  it doesn't mean i know you personally and approve of your every characteristic.  i don't have to to love you as i do.  i wish you every happiness and no suffering at all.  a word of advice:  avoid malice like the plague.  i've decided that malice is the root cause of every suffering.  don't invest yourself in malice, even in subtle ways.  and don't fear malice.  by that i mean neither be afraid of (fear) malice nor obey (fear) malice.  and by malice i mean the wish and/or intention that someone suffer, in whatever way in whatever degree, be that yourself or someone else.  never punish yourself, cause that's a form of malice and you'll suffer for it.  and *noone* deserves to suffer.  dangerous people deserve to be quarantined so they don't harm people, but they don't deserve to be punished in the sense of being made to suffer.  imagine what the world would be like without any malice at all!  seriously, imagine it.  think about it.  invest your energy like that into making the world free from malice.  even those *thoughts* actually help, i promise!  thought power is a very real thing, and it has a greater effect upon oneself and others than most of us have been trained to imagine.  use it well.  use it joyfully to abandon malice in all of its forms.  i *promise* you you'll be making good karma that way and *will* be rewarded.  invest yourself well into the abandonment of malice and you'll be rewarded mightily.  this is no exaggeration.  the reward might take a while to reach you, but it *will* come.  this is a total promise.  we *can* eliminate malice, and we *will* eliminate malice.  this is a vow of mine as well as a promise.  so, dear reader dear friend, remember that i love you.  and write to me if you need a friend, 'cause i vow that i'll be as good a friend to you as circumstances make practical.  l8rz..."], "gold_label": 0.0}

The men in the video said the killing was revenge for abuse and humiliation of 'muslims' by US guards at Abu Ghraib prison. It would have happened anyway: maybe not to this man, but it would have happened. These are the same people who threatened to burn Japanese hostages alive. This is the same mentality as the women killers on the hijacked AA flights that crashed into the twin towers, the same sort of butchers who slaughtered the tourists in Egypt, who bombed the trains in Madrid. The difference is that we are appalled and disgusted when our soldiers engage in attrocious acts; these guys are treated like heroes. At best, Islamist opinion remains muted: No we don't condone this, but you have to understand... The same shit you read from the bourgeois liberal columnists here. Where are the 'Not In My Name' marches across the Arab world?   I'm not a 'neo con'; I just don't believe, as arseholes like George Galloway, the SWP, Guardian windbags etc seem to that these Islamist fanatics are somehow on 'our' side. Our enemy's enemy or something like that. As a sort of minimal Marxist, my enemy's enemy in this case is the United States of America.  That said, the war in Iraq has been a botch from the beginning. Instead of this 'weapons of mass destruction' bullshit which nobody actually believed, it would have been better to come clean about the real reasons for invading. This is a war to shift the balance of economic and political power in the Middle East away from the posionous influence of the Saudi Arabians. By installing a pro Western or at least neutral secular 'democratic' state in Iraq, it would allow Europe and the US to disengage from their reliance on Saudi oil. The Saudis, who are the real paymasters of the Jihadists, are the real enemy. By cutting off trade, the US will effectively starve the worldwide Mujahadeen of funds. That's the thinking. There was a very small window of opportunity in which to do this and I'm very afraid that it has already closed.   ----------   CURRENTLY LISTENING TO   THE SERPENTS GOLD by Cathedral [Earache advance CD]"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Get off the pulpit and go sulk home to mommy you fucking pussy.  Oh yeah, and while you're apologizing, why don't you reimburse your employer for the last two years of 'salary' you've stolen from them, you know, now that you've  ADMITTED TO FAILING THE JOB YOU WERE HIRED/PAID TO PERFORM .  Fucking asshole.  People like this are what's wrong with the world.   No accountability what-so-ever .

I've heard countless of people say it while growing up and to this day, it has always elicited a negative reaction in my heart.  It just doesn't sound right... it makes me want to scream when I hear it, and I'm not sure why.  Whaddaya mean, small?  Maybe it's because God has never spoken to me with a 'still small voice.'  He's always been pretty loud and clear and persistent when He speaks to me; it's usually me that tries to downplay what I read consistently in the word and sense when I pray and listen to brothers and sisters.  Maybe it's because it seems to downplay the magnificence, the grandeur of God by saying that He has a small voice.  I recall this conversation I was having with this girl, and she didn't just say 'still small voice':  'Yeah Tim, cuz you know, God always speaks with this tiny, quiet, still small voice deep down, right?  It's soooooo hard to hear!'  It made me feel really sick inside.  Is this picture all God is to us?  A nanny that doesn't shout but primarily talks by whispering sweet nothings into our ears, hoping that we'll obey?  I am still not exactly sure what it is that angers me about describing Him talking with 'a still small voice.'  Where in the Bible does He talk in that fashion?  He may be still and peaceful, but He sure isn't small.  Is He out there to patronize us, or are we living to exalt Him?  Would His voice really be 'still small' if God was truly the center of our utmost attentions, passions, and desires?\n\nText 2:I've wondered for a long time why I'm too sensitive to how I feel.  This hypersensitivity leads me to come up with ideas very quickly, but I end up becoming unfocused because I try to pursue too many things at one time.  After praying and thinking about it, the only way I can combat this is by slowing my mind down and learning the discipline of patience.  I have to learn how to sit down, think out my visions and ideals, and realize that travelling the road to their actualization takes hope, perserverance, and patience.  For those of you whom are fellow brothers and sisters and Christ, please pray that God may continually train me to slow my mind down, think things through, and pursue things with a deeper sense of vision, determination and patience.  Thanks, that would be much appreciated."], "gold_label": 1.0}

It looks weird to me) 1 cup - chopped asparagus or broccoli or any other pizza friendly veggie extra virgin olive oil  Chop garlic into small pieces. Sautee chicken in pan with olive oil and garlic - adjust for preference (I personally LOVE garlic and use a million cloves). When chicken is 3/4 cooked (still slightly pink) toss in chopped asparagus or broccoli to cook slightly and soften (and coat them with garlic goodness!!). Cook chicken thoroughly and dice into bite size pieces. I usually just jab at the chicken while it's cooking to break it up. 2 part benefit : already sliced and it cooks faster!  On a cookie sheet, lay out your pizza dough and brush lightly with olive oil. Top with more garlic if you really like bad breath. Then make a thin layer of ricotta cheese across the crust. If you're working with the Pillsbury dough, you'll get a rectangular dough, so you can fill it end-to-end. Once the ricotta is in place, top pizza with chicken and veggies of your choice. Lastly, add mozzarella on top.   Follow crust baking directions (usually around 10 minutes) and ta-da! You have pizza.  Thrifty Tips : * use left over chicken or veggies * you will need only a small amount of mozzarella on this one - you can even skip it if it's too expensive for you * cut your pizza 'sicilian style' into small squares to make portions smaller and your food budget go further  This pizza is ridiculously easy and sorta fun to make, but for some reason people are always really impressed by it.

Yes, Mr. Gentyle, Kangles are being worked, but this time not for me.  Please, no comments concerning 'kangling.' :-) **** Everywhere you go, people complain.  There's always something to complain about, something to be dissatisfied about.  All the conversations I find myself getting to lately involve me listening to complaints: 'This sucks', 'this professor is a jerk', 'I don't have money', etc.  I just wonder, why do people complain?  To me, it seems to be done to gain sympathy and attention, in order to affirm self-importance/self-righteousness.  Complaints essentially say, 'This isn't the way things should be, I deserve more.'  Complaints are a declaration of ones' self-importance, aren't they?  The sad thing about all of this is that people find more pleasure in complaining instead of praising.  We seem to be so much more content about finding the faults in our environments versus rejoicing in their perks.  Another 'why':  Why do we tend to enjoy looking at the negative more than the positive?\n\nText 2:'Groggy'  I don't understand why I've been extremely groggy today, unless it's the baked eggplant ziti I've been eating the past two days.  It's all I've eaten.  Is it possible that I'm groggy because I haven't had a balanced meal?  Well, I held true to my promise so far up till now.  I haven't spent more than 20 minutes on the computer checking online journals, and I didn't go on AIM (except to add someone's SN on my list, but it was a 'sign-on, add name, sign-off' deal).  I organized all of my papers, notes, etc.  I started to read my Biochem.  Then, I fell asleep again, and dreamed this weird dream.  I came home, and we had to get ready to go to a retreat.  To my surprise, it was Grace Life Church that was over at my house, waiting for me.  To my suprise, they were sleeping over because it was going to be a retreat overseas.  Even to my FURTHER surprise, I saw Eric Ahn, who is in Hope Chapel.  I think my brain was confused and smushing my two undergrad churches together.  So, I went to sleep, and awoke.  I got ready, then my mom told me I had to be at La Guardia; up till this point I didn't know it was a retreat overseas.  Furthermore, she informed me that it was free, but I had to be at La Guardia in an hour because everyone else left.  Confused, I asked her how I was to get to the airport with no one to drive the car back.  I never got an answer about that.  Panicked, I hurried my little brother to get ready as well.  We piled into my family's old Ford Taurus, and sped off to the airport.  It was at this point that the dream slightly shifted.  We were still heading towards the same place, but now we were characters in some cheesy '60s spy comedy show.  Our car was still an old Ford Taurus, but it was falling apart at all the secret hinges that concealed the fancy features.  For example, as we made sharp turns, one half of my seat slid forward, and one slid backwards.  I had to hold them down with my thighs to prevent that shearing effect, and drive at the same time.  It was frustrating, and we realized that the evil organization was trying to slow us down.  That's when I woke up... but you know, I feel more tired in my body than I was before I went to sleep.

Should I tell someone?  About the militarisation of space, I agree with John that it looks like being inevitable at this point - not that I think we should be happy with that.  That NASA is the mechanism via which the public can be made to fund military research is nothing new, either.  Most high technology, from telecoms to nuclear weapons, is a result of public subsidies. The main  raison d'etre  of the Pentagon system was to set up this system. Once the public has paid the cost, the technology gets turned over to private enterprise to collect the profits (I believe the term for this is 'free enterprise').  And if the private enterprise gets in trouble, the public bails them out. Yay! Risk-free capitalism!   We have satellites and computers because the Pentagon and NASA covered for it (in the US - we have our own versions too, of course.  I think Alan Turing got military funding, for instance, although don't quote me.). These things are now profitable, so they get handed over to big private corporations.  This is an open secret - it's not talked about much in public, since most people don't like it when they realise they're paying to make rich people even richer, and effectively underwriting any risk, but on the other hand it needs to be known in the right sectors because, well, companies have to know where their free money's coming from.  urlLink  'This transfer between public and private industry is called Spinoff at NASA.'

L is now in AK with her mom after they went to the airport 5 different times trying to get up there for the past 5 days. Not normally a huge deal, right... wrong. Trying to get a 3 year old to cooperate for packing/unpacking/packing is a hastle. Then she gets excited and ends up back in her house. Add in the fact that the airport is 40 miles away and just in general a pain in the ass, that adds to it.  Is Hillary still leaving from Orlando? If she is, she should reconsider leaving from Panama City.  Speaking of bad flights, that reminds me what my mom had to go through on 11SEP01... She was somewhere near TN when her airplane was told to land. She landed (well the plane landed anyway) then tried for 3 hours to get a rental car. Eventually she got it and drove back to Houston. This is not a short drive, and it was my mom by herself. I have no problems driving by myself, but I almost always have 'something' with me when I am on the road. Needless to say, she made it home without any further incidents and I was, at that time, waiting to vector aircraft to start shooting down civilian planes.

YUCK.     thanksgiving day,  i woke up so freakin' early with a head ache!  i just took tylenol and forced myself to go back to sleep.  anyway, andy left the nachos we had out on the coffee table.  i guess after i threw up he decided he didn't want nachos!  haha...understandable.   when i woke up, i heard a weird sound.  i went to check up on it in the living room.  coach was freakin' eating up the nachos!  from the looks of it, she ate A LOT!  it was funny but i was mad at the same time.  i also felt sorry for her cuz i had a feeling that she wasn't gonna feel good.  thank god she had no accidents.  we had to leave to go to our family parties!  first we went to andy's auntie's house in lakewood.  then it was off to my auntie nora's house.  we ended up staying there till around midnight!     friday  was our shopping day!  i decided not to sleep since we were gonna leave the house really early!  so, we finally left the house.  i thought radio shack was gonna open at 5:30am or 6 but i was wrong.  we ended up just going to cabazon!  they had a few good stores there.  a lot of places had sales on certain items and then they give you an additional 20% or whatever it may be off your total purchase.  it was so crowded.  the line for gap was the longest.  it actually went out the door.  same thing with tommy.  after the outlet, we just stopped by circuit city, radio shack, and target.  since we were late, we weren't able to get a lot of the cheap stuff that were advertised.  oh well.  i think i wanna go to the outlet every year!  hehe.  by the time we got home, i was so tired.  every year, ross (andy's friend) has a 'day after thanksgiving' dinner.  this year i didn't make it cuz i was so freakin' tired!     saturday and sunday  was when we were finally able to relax.  it felt so good.  the only thing we did on saturday was go to ross's parent's house in anaheim hills.  the whole family went to san jose so they wanted us to house sit and watch their dog.  oh yeah, that night andy made the best baked chicken ever!  i hope he remembers how he did it.  he's the type of guy who experiments.  but yeah, it was yummy!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

As I indicated in my previous post, I have lots of thoughts on King Hezekiah.  I think that I'll work through them one by one for this and the next couple of posts so as to allow myself to process.  Last week our church arranged for the movie,  urlLink _Luther_  to be shown at the Hoffman Center ... two showings, tickets only available through our church.  It's a great movie, and I plan to purchase it if it ever comes out on DVD.  One of the things that it left me thinking about was the idea of God choosing each of us to do different things within the body.  Here was Martin Luther, essentially the father of all Protestant based theology (I might be off there ... I'm not very knowledgeable on church history) ... he was a simple monk, who was having arguments with the devil and seemed almost obsessively driven to seek church reform.  And, as a result, many have come to know Christ today as a result of his ministry.    Then there are these four kings in the Old Testament.  It's important for me to remind myself that these are not merely four guys who independently ended up as kings.  They were great-grandfather, grandfather, father and son.  And, if you look at the ages, you will see that both grandfathers were around to see their grandsons born.  What I'm thinking here is this:  Uzziah saw the birth of his grandson Ahaz.  Uzziah died when Ahaz was four years old.  Had Ahaz already started to show evil tendencies by the age of four?  Did Uzziah mourn the lack of godliness that his son showed?  Jotham died when his grandson, Hezekiah, was nine years old.  Was Hezekiah already following the Lord by that age?  Even though his father, Ahaz, was an evil man?  If you look farther into the math, Ahaz was 11 or 12 years old when Hezekiah was born.  All of these family connections make the stories more intriguing.  Now, getting back to callings and such ... I keep thinking about the fact that king #1 does good, his son king #2 does good,  his  son king #3 does very bad, and  his  son king #4 does very, very good.  These four men's lives overlapped.  Yet one of them turned out to be incredibly evil and did not at all follow the Lord.  And one of them turned out to be very much a man after God's heart, as was King David.  How does it happen that God uses one man for very, very good and another man for evil?  In fact, how did Ahaz turn out so evil when his father was such a good man?  And how did Hezekiah turn out so wonderfully good when his father was so very evil?  And then there's me.  Why did God choose me for His kingdom?  I know ... He chose to love Israel not because they were large in number (Deuteronomy 7:7) but because He loved them.  Really what He was saying was that He loved them because He loved them.  Because He wanted to.  Why did God choose to love me.  Not because I'm bigger or stronger or better or more virtuous or more pure than anyone else ... in fact I'm none of those things.  Yet He chose to love me because He loved me.  Now, I'm not one to look a proverbial gift horse in the mouth.  My frustration with this idea is for the people who God didn't chose.  I know ... I know ... the question of the ages.  Free will vs. selection.  Works vs. grace.  Maybe no human being has ever really had a good handle on answering that question.  Doesn't mean that I still don't feel a little bit of 'survivor's guilt' because I'm on this side of the line.  But when I get myself  really  mired in this question, I go even farther.  Why did Martin Luther become so important to Christianity that he was tortured by evil spirits?  Why was  he  the one that God used to begin Protestantism?  Not that I'm jealous ... please know that I don't want to be kept up at night arguing with the devil!!  But there are some God uses one way and some He uses another.  And why me ... or why not me?  Again ... asked and answered in I Corinthians 12:14ff.  God uses each member of the body differently.  If the foot decided to be a hand... if the the whole body would be a hand, how would we walk.  So ... I'll let Martin Luther be tortured by the devil ... and I'll let King Ahaz alone with his evil, God-denying reign ... and I'll let Hezekiah keep the credit for ridding Israel of idol worship and turning them back to the One, True God.  I don't know if I'm a foot or a hand or an eye or an ear or a mouth (probably the latter, LOL!), but I need to walk through every day allowing the Lord to use me as He will ... and be content in Him.\n\nText 2:Why is it that no matter how much sleep I get, it never seems to be enough?

I mean, I don't cry easily, or anything like that. I think I've only cried at a movie once in my life, that I can recall. Or, more than one tear, maybe. Anyway, I know some of you (but certainly not all of you) know that I read a lot of stories online. It's how I waste an extremely large percentage of my time. Many of the stories are pretty crappy, since people write crap pretty easily, but there are a number of exceptionally good authors out there. Anyway, there's this one story that I read about a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago, and I just remember it being really good and really sad. I just re-read it again tonight, and my memory just didn't do it justice. I literally had tears streaming down my face for about 5 minutes. This  never happens .  I don't know why I felt the need to share that.\n\nText 2:Well, I'm heading off to the airport in an hour or so. I hope everyone else has (or has had) a fantastic spring break!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

What do you do when every last bit of will is lost?  I don't know why, but those thoughts plague me non-stop.  It's not because I'm pessimistic, masochistic, sadistic, or any other '-istic;' I don't voluntarily sit down and  intentionally  dwell in them.  Strangely, for every dreaming optimism that grips my tiny mind, five more accusing insecurities wrestle for attention.  This pattern is the way I can always remember being characteristic of my personality.  ****   Telling moment :  When I was in fourth grade, I sometimes stayed after school to participate in the arts and crafts activities held in one of the classrooms.  During childhood, I was always adept in this arena.   I especially had a knack for origami above all the other crafts, because I enjoyed the lengthy, precise procedures that produced fantastical paper animals.  So, in this one particular day, the teacher held up a thick, braided square and announced that we were making potholders that day.  We all got up and grabbed a mass of thick hairbands; these were the material we would use to weave the potholders.  She then distributed these square plastic racks with pins sticking up along the perimeter; these objects acted as the looms for the hairbands.  I confidently sat in my seat, forming my plan of action to make the best potholder at the fastest rate than anyone else in the room.  I stretched a hairband from one peg to its adjacent partner, and repeated the process down the face of the loom.  Looking around, I saw that everyone hadn't even finished half of what I had done so far.  This part would then become the real challenge:  weaving the perpendicular rows of hairbands.  Stretch.  Push.  Pull.  Stretch.  Push.  Pull. Stre   Man!  I stretched too hard, , I thought in my mind as the perpendicular band popped off of its peg.  I had to start over again, because in snapping off, it pulled the band I was weaving, which pulled the bands that were already weaved.  I reformed the row of hairbands, and began to weave again.  Stretch.  Push.  Pull.  Stre   What? I didn't even do it hard this time.   Fix. Stretch.  Push.  Pull.  Stretch.  Pus   Again?   By this time, I had already started to grunt and feel the steam coming out of my ears.  Fix. Stretch.  Pu  Frustrated, I stood up and stared at the loom with frustration... and felt a tear coming down my face.    Ashamed that I had started to cry, I started to get even more angry.  Determined to get it right, I sat down to start again, but I was too angry to do it in a good, controlled fashion.  I looked up and saw that everyone around me had already finished weaving halfway across the loom, and here I was, my fantasy of finishing on top shot.  At this point, all the elements came together to push more tears out.  I couldn't believe I was crying, but I was, and the teacher had noticed by this point... and did the exact thing I didn't want her to do:  she walked over and asked if I was crying, loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.  Embarrassed, the tears became sobs, which me made me even angrier that I, a boy, was crying in front of everyone over something utterly stupid.  I stormed out of the room.\n\nText 2:Your beauty within is rarely discovered without a friend who is willing to go to the depth to find it. Moreover, it will never be known to the public if no one is willing to advertise it on your behalf.  The legends of sages and saints are much the same in this regard, for they are tales demonstrating their inner strength and piety, tales that have been passed down through history and have become treasures of our collective memory; but they are just old advertisements, to be sure. There have been many more pious men who remained obscure because their piety was never made known to others.      For any opinion, no matter how trivial and value-neural, there are inevitably many who regard it as offensive.      There will always be more people who prefer opining or speculating over putting their ideas to actual tests. In many ways, this is a good thing.  Since most ideas and beliefs are neither valid nor practical, it is best that they are mostly entertained rather than realized.      When the conceptually abstract entangles you in the dizzying maze of confusion, wrangle free by embracing reality.      No idea is thoroughly original.  Therefore, the secret to true genius lies with copying ideas and convincing others that you are the sole proprietor.      Simple ideas can be difficult to grasp if they are novel to those who try to understand them."], "gold_label": 0.0}

After a long day of script revisions, interoffice web porn fiascos, and a so so preview screening of one of our new episodes, the day is STILL not over!  I'm currently clawing my face off waiting for Boss #1 to finish his A story and make a B line to the door for the night.  Until then, I will attempt to BLOG something worth reading.  Or not.    Recap on some of K's weekend :    'Lost in Translation'   Caught 'Lost in Translation' at the  urlLink ArcLight Hollywood   Not only were Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsens' performances superb, but I had completely forgotten how wonderful the ArcLight Theater itself is.  No, I haven't gotten over the fact that a ticket costs $14, but being able to purchase the tickets in advance and have reserved seating so you can waltz in a minute before the previews start is definitely worth it.  If the movie is in the  urlLink Cineramadome  this cooky usher stands up and introduces the movie, who's in it, who directed it, and any other little useless tidbits one might want to know about the movie they're so anxiously awaiting to see.  *Remember to consider being that lame usher when unemployed* Other great things about the movie also worth noting; cinematography and Giovanni Ribisi nailing the hell out of the Spike Jonze-ish character.  I just helped Boss #1 spell Damocles.  *Wondering just HOW that fits into our little show here*   'Guess' What I Did?   No haircut was had.  I didn't get up as early on Saturday as I would've liked, and had to rush to the eye doctor appointment (gotta take advantage of this great insurance while I have it) for the yearly eye exam.  I had mentioned to the eye doc that I wanted to be able to wear my glasses to work more, and she recommended transition lenses!  Um, NO THANKS.  Yes, I want to be comfortable, but aint' no way in hell I'm gonna start looking like a skeezy dude who drives a conversion van with that wood paneling stripe on the side.    Also, how is one supposed to properly pick out a new pair of glasses when they don't have their glasses on to see correctly?  I asked the sweet eye technician, Coyo, to help me narrow down the two pairs of glasses I had, 'Better 1? Better 2?'  We deduced that plastic glasses slide off of this big shnozz of mine, so we went with the metal framed Guess glasses.  I just might start tight rolling the jeans again and carrying an Esprit tote again.    It was interesting too, the optical emporium had a fine line of glasses from Lauren Hutton and Catherine Deneuve's respective collections.  I guess I didn't realize that over the hill actresses could make a killing in eyeglasses.  Who knew!  Okay, I think I'm going to go upstairs and make some EasyMac.

I've just spent the last few months tearing into Halo for the second time and having beaten it just a week ago I was feeling very empty and cold on the inside---'gamer's lament'. I spent a few days holding my X-Box controller staring at an empty TV screen just kinda hoping something would happen.  Like maybe a new level would magically pop-up.....or maybe Halo 2 would be released 5 months early and my brother would bring it home.... or maybe some space aliens would come down from planet Nintendron and ask me to save a far of world making me an real life intergalactic hero!!!!    To my dismay, none of these things happened....no matter how hard I drank.  But then, while taking a leak a few days ago, I heard a commercial in the other room for Hitman: Contracts and how it was already out in stores.  A light shone down from above and I ran to the car (after my brother got back from work with it 7 hours later - 'grumble'). I've played the first 2 Hitman games and they rank as 2 of my all-time favorites.  Sniper rifles, explicit language and strong sexual content...This was exactly what I was looking for.    This takes us into last night, 2 days and 50 dollars later, when I finally had time to sit down and install it. Or should I say, attempt to install it.  After repeatedly installing and uninstalling the game 5 times, I began to get a little upset. It would claim to have installed, but upon running the game, nothing would happen....i mean nothing!!!! no errors, no blue screen... just a desktop and an unspoken message of 'go f@ck yourself' coming from my computer.  So let's go to the Eidos technical support page, where they ask me to type in the error message i received.  Um...yeah...was there a 'no message' option....no.  So I navigate the site for a while and finally find another tech support route, where they ask me to explain what component of my computer is causing the problem... hmmm....no idea, let me refer to the error message....oh wait IT DOESN'T EXIST!!!!  Now I'm not a big computer guy, but i'm not a complete idiot so i take a few guesses.  after tooling around for a half hour i randomly come across a link that says 'when attempting to run the game, program kicks out to desktop - no error message'  Holy Crap!!! Signs of life...though where was this link when i did a search for 'desktop' and 'no error message' 45 minutes ago, apparently this was just added to the site since then...but nevermind, i'm close to the end....i think.  So I hit the link and read this....  'the following are a list of possible solutions'  - Install DirectX 9.0                    (did that already)  - Uninstall DirectX 9.0 and reinstall    (um...ok)  - Restart Computer and try again         (shouldn't this be #1)  - Reinstall game                          (way ahead of you pal)  - Uninstall game,restart comp,reinstall     (this seems silly)  - Uninstall game,reinstall DirectX 9.0,reinstall game.(ok, sure)  - Uninstall game, then reinstall  (and this is different how?)      - Uninstall DirectX and game, then restart computer,reinstall     DirectX 9.0 and game                         (Kill me)   - Empty C:Win/Temp folder                   (?????????) - Upgrade sound card drivers for DirectX    (ok, makes sense) - Upgrade video card drivers for DirectX    (again makes sense)  - Upgrade sound card     (so buy a new one? yeah,go f@ck yourself) - Upgrade video card     (why don't I just buy a whole new                           computer...you douche)  The List goes on for pages and pages....with no error message there is no way to narrow it down!!!!  After four hours I finally stumble upon an acceptable solution and after lowering the acceleration on my sound card...the game runs.  Way to go Eidos' streamlined trouble shooting methods, only took 4 hours.  So I sit down to play....very happy, very tired....and on the first mission in the game....most of the wall are SEE-THRU.  Dammit!!!!  Dammit....Dammit....Dammit....Dammit....(in real life i wasn't saying Dammit)  back to the Eidos web page....god save me  I go into the 'Gameplay problems' area and navigate to 'video problems' after a 15 minute runaround I find an exact description of my problem and a few links to solutions.   The first link is: 'Window ME users go here'  hey!!!  I have Windows ME!!! The answer is only one click away and then I can play my precious game....please god let it be over after this.  and it was....  the answer was there....and so was the end....  'This game is not designed for Windows ME' 'This site does not support Windows ME users'  and it says that where?  Not on the box...but on the website, after you're soul is destroyed.  About 10 minutes later I spoke to Skiz who informed me that Taco Bell has discontinued the Cheesy Gordita Crunch.  Thanks for the 'Coup de Grace' Skiz  Sorry this was so long but imagine what the ordeal was like in person.... F@ck you Eidos!!!!\n\nText 2:I would like to first thank my current employer for the opportunity to do absolutely nothing but think for the past 2 days. That being said I really didn't think of much, but I did get a few ideas for my latest pet project, the animated series if you haven't seen my site bornatthezoo since the last updapte...6 years ago. Anyone that has kept up on what has been going on there will notice that nothing is going on there right now, mainly because I haven't posted any of my new ideas there, but that is where you folks are lucky. Below are a few ideas that I have, most are underdeveloped and vague but hopefully with a bit of imagination you'll see what I am reaching for. First it might help for some background on what I invision:     The main characters : 2 creatures from a subworld of our world, and a guy like the  urlLink The Gimp  (obviously not exactly like him for copyright reasons but not your typical cartoon person).   The theme : Right now I plan to have 2 worlds (could be more what do I know, but only 2 worlds that I am concerned with) that coexist, one of which is this crazy creature world, the other which is this world. The idea behind crazy creature world (not to be confused with the pet store in Jackson spelled Krazy Kreatures) is that it exists within electronics, so for example the physics based reasoning behind TVs with electron guns and all that crap are just a front for some creature drawing on the other side of your TV and all the things we make crazy explanations about are all just magical creatures behind the works. Very few in either world know about the other world except those who created (think it would be funny to have some famous inventor like say Edison paying off one of these critters to jump inside one of his inventions so he can claim it worked)   The Problem:  I have a bunch of skits, but I am finding it hard to link everything together since I have no real point. In any event do me a favor and post some replies as to why this idea sucks so I can fix it up. I'll post some skits on here soon after I get some feedback on the crap I just wrote"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Perhaps our exchange will be of use to others looking to do the same:  I've installed the  urlLink MySQL package  from Server Logistics and I'm real rusty in theTerminal. I'm trying set the path so I don't have to type the entire string all the time. Now I don't see a file called '.tcshrc' in my home directory so I need tomake one. Just call name the file with the extention?  Yep, exactly. In Unix a file that starts with a period doesn't actually have an extension, the period tells the system that the file should be invisible (like the Finder's Invisible flag). This is used to hide configuration files from the user and works with any file (stick a period at the beginning of a JPEG's filename and it'll disappear from sight). Before we go further, a few key unix commands you'll need:   ls   Shows all the _visible_ files in a directory    ls -al   Shows _all_ the files in a directory, including the invisible ones    locate   Unix locate utility, much faster than the Finders and it'll find files the Finder won't (like .tcshrc) Used like:  > locate .tcshrc Returns:   > /Users/god/.tcshrc    pwd   Stands for 'print working directory'. Shows you the complete path to where you currently are  Not to mention I get confused between /Users/myuser and /usr/local for 'homedirectory'. It would be /Users/myuser, right?  When docs refer to the Home directory, they means yours, in this case /Users/myuser. /usr/local is system-wide and probably not where you want to make these changes.  Can I make this file using Pico? The Thomas Berger notes mention an appcalled 'vi' but running that in Terminal appears totally greek to me.  Yes but the Unix geeks will laugh at you. Personally I like pico and use pico for all my cmd-line text editing because I've never been able to figure out how to use vi or vim or emacs and don't care to take the time to learn. Your choice of text editor appears to be a huge deal in the Unix world (go figgur). When unix geeks ask me and I say 'pico' they laugh at me and then usually get into a shouting match with each other over vi vs. emacs. I don't know how familiar you are with pico but none of the key commands are the same as any standard Mac app. The important ones:   Saving: control-O (oh)  Quitting: control-X  Cancelling: control-C   BTW, BBEdit's 'Open Hidden...' feature is invaluable for this sort of thing too, as it'll let you open and edit text files normally invisible to GUI applications. pico's great for small stuff like this but for editing the likes of Apache's massive conf files nothin' beats BBEdit. Finally, here's what my .tcshrc looks like so you have something to compare to:  setenv PATH '$PATH':/Library/MySQL/bin setenv PATH '$PATH':/Library/PostgreSQL/bin setenv LC_ALL C setenv CVSROOT '/usr/local/cvsrep'    urlLink Discuss"], "gold_label": 1.0}

She is so fragile that the coughing she had been doing was ripping her throat open and causing her to bleed.  So she was rushed to the hospital where she was put on IV and oxygen immediately.  Within a few hours, she was doing better, but not much.  The coughing and such had subsided.  The poor woman is 96, and will be 97 in July.  She has Alhzeimers and knows no one.  It really hurts my Dad for him Mother to not know who he is.  She has gone from being about 180 lbs and in decent health in the early 90's to being an 80 lb person with no quality of life, who knows no one, is blind in both eyes, is deaf and doesn't speak.  I find it so unfair that young people are killed every day, all around the world, yet here is a woman who 'I haven't known in 10 years' who is in pain with a broken hip, requires morphine daily to keep down the pain.  She lies in bed suffering, and yet people are dying every day who I know she would if she could, gladly give them her life.  Anyway, enough with that.  I feel so much better now that I've vented.  And for those who didn't know, I recently started a new job in May.  I am a Support Specialist Level I at the University of Lethbridge library.  I moved across Canada to be here.  I live with Weagle (Scott) and Sydney (Susan) currently.  I am really enjoying my new job and the new area.  As my new manager said this morning, 'You'll be my Jake-of-all-trades.'  I will be doing html and java script, along with redesigning some webpages for the library, along with my current PC repair and media duties.  I'm excited.  The more useful I can make myself, the better chance that this will become a full time position for me after this contract expires.  Other than that, I really don't have much more to say.  For the last week, I have been watching my DVD set of Robotech, the first series, with Rick Hunter, Minmei, Max Sterling, Lisa Hayes and crew.  It's a great anime series from the early 80's.  I can't get enough of it.  But at 50 dollars a boxed set, and I have 3 of the 7, I couldn't afford more.  But then I tried Ebay and found them for about 5 dollars to 10 dollars American and started buying them up.  2 more sets are on the way and I'm currently bidding on 2 more.  This rocks!  It's exciting.  This weekend will be fairly quiet.  I hope to go to Cranbrook with Scott and Susan to drop off Susan's car for her parents, but I may just stay home and watch the NASCAR race from Sonoma, California!  I love road racing.  Anyway, enjoy your weekends and we'll see you again soon.  Same blog-time, same blog-channel!\n\nText 2:I am a moron. I just admitted my feelings to her. Every time I do this, it always changes things. Even if they say it won't, it will. So maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the one who changes. You know, sometimes I just think, 'Is anything ever going to come easy for me? Is anything meant to be for me?' But apparently not. It looks like I'm just gonna have to figure everything out and work for everything I get on my own. Not that it hasn't always been this way. But with everything that's going on right now, I really notice it alot more. And it seems alot worse. I wish I could change my circumstances. I wish I could have my life laid out before, and all I'd have to do is just follow the directions. Unfortunately, things don't come so easy. But maybe it's a good thing. I'll probably value whatever I gain or lose a lot more because I'm working so hard for it. If I didn't,  I'd probably feel almost cheated when I reached the end.

No window can I see. No wind can I hear. Up above the traffic is my tranquil world. Outside weather and life happen.  But I am unaware in my box.  Summer may bring a clap of thunder, but never loud enough to be sure. Snow is too silent. I may enter the box with a clean sidewalk below and exit with it being six inches deep. But I cannot tell from my box.  Fall drops leaves that are 28 stories below me.  I cannot see or hear them. Spring brings warmth that cannot be felt through the controlled air system.  Windows do not open.  No fresh air enters. If you spot an insect, think of this, it must have ridden the elevator too!  My only salvation is the radio. If the world has a crisis, they may break in and tell me, If they deem it more important then the latest Matchbox 20 song. Otherwise I am forced to assume all is well outside my box.  Eight hours a day, five days a week. I only get three weeks vacation. Why do I let life pass me by like this?  What keeps me here?  Is it the benefits? Do they outweigh the harm I encounter with each passing moment?  I have seven square feet of space. I face one corner most days. Glued to the screen. It is my only outlet to the world.    Intense heat in my apartment last night....I mean it got so hot that I thought I was going to melt into the sheet.  Now mind you it was only 70 something outside it was like 88 in my room, and this was with the fan on....JS was sleeping next to me and I swear he was dying from thirst because of the intense heat.  Now I know heat rises, but last night was ridiculous.   SO yes today is Wednesday, which means I have Monday and Tuesday to talk about... So Monday JS and I had lunch together, we went to Ranch 1 for lunch and he looked so handsome in his beige shirt and his cute red sneakers, and his goattee was growing in nicely...anyways then we went to Battery City Park for a little stroll but it was quick since my lunch was almost over, but it was so romantic, I love spending time with him...I just feel like the world is alright and its just him and I, and I don't care what people think about us, its a great feeling.....soooo then he walked me to the building and we kissed goodbye....That night was class and it was so much fun we did a reading of Glen English's 'SEX LIVES OF WAITERS', which is a brilliantly written play...and the class did an amazing cold reading of it.  Then after class we had an answer session and then we decided since we were getting new carpet, that we would paint the room first.  So we all grabbed a brush and painted the room, it was a lot of fun...and in the end looked great....then it was time to head home...zzzzzzzzzzzz  Tuesday....Today was just a shitty day for the most part till evening...I mean it started out crappy, continued being crappy, till I just rearranged my cubicle and realized this is stupid I dont need to be in a bad mood...things are good...so I went and had lunch with JP and AS, Burgerking...YUMMMY!  Then came back to finish up my little redecorating....then went out to Williamsburg to meet JS, now I have to say I loved that neighborhood, totally the vibe I want and will create, just got to get a little bit more of a body...which is good I am gaining a bit of weight, just got to keep at it....anyways went to JS's place which is this really cute place, with cute hardwood floors and JS's room is cute, reminds me of a college dorm..it was neat..and met one of his roommie's Colin who is an actor as well.  Then JS and I headed out to my place, now mind you I was really really really tired so we just lounged at the apartment, ordered Chinese food and basically called it a night...ended the night with a triple bang and crashed around midnight.  I got to wake up to JS, which was a great sight....    A painting is never finished. It simply stops in interesting places.  - Paul Gardener\n\nText 2:when you check out the cometothewell.com site (as i know you all do), be sure to go to the artists community and check out everyone's stuff. currently we have work from corey, chad, brandi, john ammons (moscow), me, and cody. lachelle is coming soon and we'd love to add others as well. check it out and enjoy.   www.cometothewell.com/artcomm   j"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Let me tell you the tale of this empty old glass Coke bottle. Back in the Dark Ages of the previous century, namely the fifties, people used to drink out of bottles that were made entirely out of glass. At least, I think so. It's rather hard to select a useful wad of information out of the nearly never-ending stream of inane bullshit that flows out of an old person's mouth. But I'm almost certain that in between heavy bouts of grim nagging about kids these days, immigrants and the weather, I picked up something along the lines of, 'In my day, we drank out of glass. Not like you lazy kids these days, always drinking out of plastic. Now, in my day, we didn't do that. In my day, we...'  The reason I didn't continue the last sentence, is that I was unable to do so as I was in the middle of passing out from an overdose of slobber and gentle prune wafts that were constantly blown in my face. As I regained consciousness, I recalled the wise, and rather fetid, old man and his incredible tale of an empty glass Coke bottle that faced many dangers but, against all odds, reached its goal, and wiped away a tear that made its way down my cheek. When I moved to get up, I felt something push against my hand and glanced down. There it stood, proud and tall, the old Coke bottle. Awed, I picked it up and cradled it in my arms. Through streaming tears, I looked up at the sky and smiled. 'Thank you, stinky old man,' I whispered and lifted the bottle up towards the sun, drawing odd looks from passers by, 'I will never forget this!'  I often think back to that hot afternoon. The one when the old man gave me, or I violently took it from him, I don't remember these silly details, the empty Coke bottle, and an angry scowl shapes my brow, for the afternoon was scorching hot, and yet, this selfish old fart refused to let me sip from his stupid Coke bottle. I'd love to tell you that the bottle and I remained very good friends, but, alas, I must disappoint you, as I threw it, in a fit of rage, against the curb. I recall its cries, which were all in my head, as I'm apparently nuts, for help as I clutched it tightly against my bosom and whispered I would meet it in the afterlife before I let it slip quietly from my grasp. Ah, the good old days, I say!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

The 'Oh, Snap!' Game. This game is simple and can be played by anyone. You do a movie line, then insert the phrase. Here's an example. ANAKIN: You are in my very soul, tormenting me. PADME: Oh, snap. That wasn't the best example, but it was the first one that came to mind. So, anyway, Michael and I were just playing that game with LOTR. Then we started randomly parodying it, which turned out to be something that sounded a lot like  urlLink The Shifty Troublemaker , i.e. hilarious. (You all would know that if you'd READ IT, but I digress.)  So, what we want to do is a compendium LOTR MST-ish spoof. The plan is for everybody who'll be in Indy on March 30 to go to Michael's house and watch Fellowship and provide commentary. Those who won't be there will catch up later.

She quivered in her seat as the man approached and couldn't bring herself to look up at him.  He cleared his throat and sounded strangely feminine. Emma finally gathered the courage to peer up at him. She saw not a man, but Alana, a concerned look on her face.  'Are you OK?' Alana asked. Emma shook her head. 'I have to get out of here.'

'I vonlunteer not to be here.' Emma announced as the other addicts looked at her with a masked approval in their eyes. She had the courage to do what they all wished they could.  Alana unlocked the door by tapping in a simple five-digit code into the pad attatched the wall. She stood at the door long enough to watch Emma leave and turned her attention back towards the other inpatients.   Emma burst through the door of her apartment and flung her bag to the wall. She kicked off her shoes and stepped over important books and papers that carpetted her floor. She managed to thrust herself into the bedroom in time for the tears to come crashing down her cheeks. She wanted a hit, something to make the reality slip away again. She wanted to feel the cool grass beneath her.  Pushing herself from up off the bed and wiping her face with both hands, smearing the tears across her face, Emma began to dig through the already messed up drawers of her wardrobe and vanity dresser. There were empty, save for a collection of clothing. Emma let out an angry cry and tore back into the living room.  She ripped open her bag and dug through the junk there, searching for her wallet. She found it, and a small amount of cash she had to last her for the fortnight. To hell with it all, she thought, as she picked up the phone and called her contact.

Which of the following does the stranger say?   1. 'Isn't that a beautiful picture?' 2. 'What do you think of this painting?' 3. 'Excuse me, do you have the time?' 4. 'You know, I happen to be a painter myself.'    [In this imaginary scenario, the words the stranger spoke actually reflect how you react in chance encounters and when meeting others. Your answer reveals  what kind of impression you make when meeting someone for the first time. ]   1. 'Isn't that a beautiful picture?'    Your friendly and positive nature creates a great first impression on almost everyone you meet. Your only concern should be that people may not take you seriously at first.    2. 'What do you think of this painting?'   You're the type who likes to feel out the other's temperament before committing yourself to anything. People can sense that hesitancy, and it may color their reactions to you. You won't step on any toes with your cautious approach, but you may end up living on the people's terms.   3. 'Excuse me, do you have the time?'   To half the world you seem like an all right sort, but to the other half you look just a little strange. You create a first impression of living life at your own pace and maintaining an individuality that some would call eccentric. You don't place much importance on what others may be thinking or feeling. For better or worse, therein lies the secret to you.   4. 'You know, I happen to be a painter myself.'   On first meeting someone, you come across as a little bit nervous and overeager. Maybe you're just trying too hard to be liked, but the harder you try, the worse impression you make. Don't worry so much about making people think you're great - they'll like you better if you just loosen up and relax.\n\nText 2:So, I've finally come up for air. I'm taking too many breaths. I've got so much to do. So much to say.

(If anybody knows the title of the book Tom Peters co-authored about branding, published circa 1980, please let me know. It was a fantastic book that doesn't contain all the awful self-help language he employs these days. The dark side of success. And branding. Everyone copies you and the parody makes the original laughable. Sorta. Anyway...)  There is a lot to web standards and  urlLink accessibility . No more do web developers have to write six different pages for six different browsers. Mainly, they need to focus on 5% of the web's users who use standards-compliant browsers and then do some minimal hacking to accommodate the other 95%. Cough, Redmond, cough. Please make IE7  urlLink the best browser . :pray:  Anyway, thank gawd that the browser wars are (mostly) over. (Now, could we do something about our two-party political process! I'm all about the lack of standards when the two opposing parties are basically the same. Um, where was I?) That's right, back in the halcyon days of early 2001 when I took to the road, I tried to redesign my website from my car while doing 85 mph. Zogging while others thought zagging was cooler than zigging. Well, I quickly learned that my poor HTML 3 skills were not going to cut it out on the open road. That Adobe GoLive could only do so much and too much (bloated code). Too many of my friends were having difficulty browsing my site or even downloading it (not to mention uploading it from a 14k wireless modem). Well, the downloading/uploading problem was easily solved but the browser issues were another matter. I threw my hands in the air and awaited the web world people to get their act together.  The saddest bit about all of this is that the tools to obtain web standards, CSS (loosely: design) and XHTML (loosely: structure)*, were finally accepted in prime time when I eschewed my web presence back in late-Spring of 2001. I've lost three years! Had I been patient or not been so taken by, um, well her name is unimportant...  *Content can be achieved by a variety of means as can XHTML but it is all circular and above the reach of this post.   So, if you are interested in standards, I suggest stopping by the sites  urlLink A List Apart  and  urlLink Asterisk* , the latter seems to be the most focused blog on web design issues regarding standards.  Of course, I am only now crawling out from the waters of theory (read: I was reading books) and onto the land of practice (read: plowing through websites for quick tips as I quickly relaunch my personal website), so there is probably  urlLink a lot more out there  concerned with my standards interests (both arguments for and against) that I've not had enough time to read.

I support the impending conflict.  I have a hard time calling it a war for two reasons.  First, Congress will not declare war.  Second, just as the Tampa Bay Bucaneers playing Lee-Davis High School is not a football game, the US military versus the remnants of the Iraqi military is not a war.  Given the tenacity of the Israelis, I think they could defeat Iraq in a conventional fight.  Those last two words are the key to me.  Both Johnathan and Miriam have said that the Bush administration has not made a strong case for going to war with Iraq.  I have no doubt that Iraq has WMD.  Probably not nuclear, as nuclear material has a habit of leaving a foot print, but biological and chemical are much harder to track.  I have no doubt that our intelligence agencies, embarassed and pissed off about their gaffes pre-September 11, 2001, have sources and proof of these WMD.  For two reasons (alerting Sadaam of what we know and having him move them and protecting our intelligence sources), we have not come out and said 'OK, over here they have 2 tons of Anthrax, and over there they have 500 gallons of VX.  There are weapons that Iraq previously admitted having that are unaccounted for.  That is scary.  It would not take much for Sadaam to give these things to Osama and his buddies, if it meant hurting the US.  Yes, Sadaam is considered an infidel by OBL.  I'm sure Sadaam considers OBL a madman (funny, when you think about Sadaam's mental state).  They don't like each other, true.  But, their hatred of us (and western culture in general) is greater.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend (for now).  Why do you think we supported Iraq in their war against Iran?  Because we thought Sadaam was a righteous dude?  Heck no.  It was because our choices of opposition to Iran (who was holding the hostages) were extremely limited (the Soviet Union, like that would happen, and Afghanistan, who, oh by the way, had been invaded by the Soviet Union.  So, we made a deal with the devil in the name of trying to get our people back.  So, if OBL sent Sadaam a message saying he had a way to get a WMD into NYC, DC, or LA, don't you think he would give OBL whatever was needed to deliver it there?  I agree, peace and diplomacy should always be the first option, but we have had 12 years of defiance of the terms Sadaam agreed to as part of the end of the Gulf War.  That is the difference between 'defying' an optional treaty that you didn't sign (Kyoto and the International War Crimes) versus a treaty that was part of the terms of your surrender.  How much longer are we supposed to give him to comply?  At what point do we say enough is enough?  When a city disappears in a mushroom cloud or a VX bomb goes of in Central Park?  Three thousand people were killed a year and half ago by Islamic extremists.  They will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate anywhere in the world and give them no support structure supplying weapons and money.  Now, if it ends up that Iraq does not have WMD, you will see a huge backlash against Bush, and Edwards/Kerrey/Clinton/Gephardt will be the next president.  That, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me.  But, if the peoples trust is broken, Bush will not survive politically.\n\nText 2:The multiple Agent Smiths was the kind of thing I had hoped we'd see in Episode II.

Yeah, I know. Looks like I'll have a more difficult time printin' em out. Darn those new hues. This makes my life so much more stressful. How will I pay for my TrippleX clothes?

Perhaps I could enter a pageant for a few bucks? I would need money to spend on a personal coach though. So if you would like to sponsor me speak up. Personal coaches are the best, you pay them to fluff your ego and fill you with a false sense of pride. Whoa, *idea*, I could totally pull that one off. I mean getting paid to sit down, eat and lie?

Choir concert today.  I'm hesitant to say anything about it for fear of that sounding like the most important.  We did well.  I, on the other hand, made a complete ass of myself onstage.  But apparently Mrs. Dingman is the only one who noticed.  I don't know.     One good thing about being in the prestigious top three choirs is you get to watch the Hip Street girls change clothes.  Of course, their overall hotness level went down a notch when Danielle left, but it's still at, like, 9.6 out of 10. Which means Laura must be, like, a 22, as I realized I'd actually rather look at her fully clothed then watch them in their underwear.      Kudos to Millenium, they improved dramatically since Thursday.  They've still got a long way to go, though.  But so do we all.      Shiny red doesn't become me.  Just had to say that, cause it's so true.  I have a whole new respect for Lexi; she got my hair to stay back and up.  The combination of that and the suit, of course, made me look like a colombian drug lord, but that's life.  Lexi is also I have to say the most attractive African American girl I've ever met.  Not to say black girls aren't attractive, just that it's better than saying 'Fourth hottest girl'. (By the way, number 3 is actually Mexican, so don't tell me I'm being racist).  She's a senior, though, so just about as off-limits as Tiffany.  Oh well.    Thank you for your comments Soph, they made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but not fuzzy like when you eat mold.

But anyways, last night I received a message from a friend telling me that all the stuff I go through is totally how she feels. Now this is totally awesome! I mean, the whole purpose of this blog is to show everyone what I go through, and at the same time show that we all go through a lot of the same issues; that we're not alone. But, for now I don't have anything to say....but sooner or later I will....until next time.\n\nText 2:Not much has really happened in the past 2 days now. Me and Adam talked for awhile and then he told me he'd call me back when he got home since that u can barely hear him when he's in his car. You see someone broke into his car and the back window is broken of course so he duck taped it but it still doesnt do the job. And then i was very dissapointed in him, he didnt call me he just texted me and said 'sry i just got home' and that was it. nothin like o im tired and gonna take a shower and go to bed so ill talk to u later. o well, anyways the next day i get woken up by my dad callin me on my phone sayin he needs me to do a favor for him. now im so not a mornin person, so if u could imagne me tryin to go online and look up a number for him, well, its just not a pretty sight. he told me the city was palo alto, i typed in san pablo (who knos what the hell i was thinkin). well i went back to bed and then at about 10 my moms like danette dont u have to babysit and be there at 10:30, o shit is right. well i just threw my hair up, washed my fase, ate, dressed, and left. the kids name is ryan and he is such a cutie, hes 2 and a half yrs old and we played with play dough at first. then we painted for a while, and then i asked him if he wanted to go to the park. i got to go and say hi to my buddies at the pool and introduced him to them. i babysat for liek 3 hrs and then she took me home. after that i just kinda hung around the house and watched movies and well just plainly bored. my parents said hey lets go out to dinner, so we went to celias which was awesome as always. there was a mariachi band and all and they played a song for us which was pretty cool. then we went off to blockbuster and i got to see my sexy adam, o was i excited. after i was in there forever tryin to pick out a movie i finally figured out what i wanted and then went home. ricardo called me and we talked for a couple hours and then he got tired so he said goodbye. that was my chance to call up adam so i could talk with him and we talked until he got home and was gonna take a shower and go to bed. lol he told me if i can wait our first date will be the day after my 18th bday, and he wants me to wear a skirt since i never do. adam is a funny one only thinkin bout me and a skirt. but u never kno maybe me and adam will keep in touch for another 3 yrs and maybe we both wont be with anyone at the time and maybe we will have our first date the day after my bday. i dunno its just adam is an awesome guy that i luv talkin with and i dunno i dont feel stupid round him when i go on and on bout nothing. today i woke up to my parents pissed at me cause of my phonebill and the fact that i was on the phone during work and not just on break, which i swear i wasnt. o well its kinda weird how u think u did one thing and u really did another. i took a shower and then had to go to the doctors cause i have a god damn bladder infection and then came home and found my dad, cousin, and his friend cuttin down our palm tree. we got some lunch for them eventually and yea roamed around the town goin and buyin stuff up that we need for vacation. i watched the rest of my movie that adam told me to get and also watched some tom cruise movie which both were really good. but the endings needed more in my personal opinion. so yea i finally got around to packin most of my crap and then cleaned my room. now if u were to see my room before hand u wouldve asked me how it was possible to clean it this much and the small amount of time that i did. well i dunno i just did lol, my desk wasnt the prettiest thing in sight. the way i typed on my laptop was i had to raise my arms in the air so that i could reach other the papers that i had in order to touch the keyboard. and also the laptop was slanted to the side cause of the only spot that was available. well now i threw away a lot of the crtap that was layin round my desk like candy and crap from valentines day that i just hid under months of papers that stack up day after day. my desk now i am proud to say looks somewhat organized to my best i can and now i have this huge area to be able to type to u people and not be uncomfortable at the same time. my bed i actually made and then i cleaned up a few odds and ends on the floor and well my room hasnt looked this good in well i dont kno when. it wont last long tho, i bid u that. o well it makes the parentals happy, cause the fact is, is that were goin on vacation and my dad said i couldnt go unless i cleaned my room. and now just o throw some things away and move some stuff to another place, but an actual clean the desk so that it looks nice and so on. well i think im satisfied so hopefully my dad will too and then well go to blockbuster and see my adam. whenever i call him or he calls me u kno what he calls me, 'my love'. o and do i luv it when he calls me that, i just say heyyy sexxxyyyy lol. well u all ppl prob think that im crazy and a ho for wantin to be with a 22 yr old, but no were not gonna do anything. were just friends that luv to flirt and kno that we gotta wait til im 18 and

I traveled to Cuba recently, and got to form my own impressions. I went on an educational exchange program, exempting me from U.S. travel restrictions. With some other American academics, I gave a series of lectures at the Center for the Study of the United States, at the University of Havana. Our hosts were particularly impressed with my color overheads. Being well paid to make the trip, I paid for the overheads myself rather than bill them to Duke\u2014they had cost me about $1.50 per page to produce. Our hosts were professors and were also well paid, earning in some cases more than $20 per month. The idea that someone would pay nearly $30 to make 18 overheads, on his own, amazed them. I later found out that many of the professors also drove taxis on nights and weekends, since they could make a month\u2019s salary in tips in a couple of days.   While you need a visa to get into Cuba, you may as well leave your Mastercard on your dresser at home. Cubans take plastic, but they cannot accept cards issued by U.S. banks (because of the U.S. law). So Americans have to use currency. This is less of a problem than you\u2019d think, because the currency everyone uses is American dollars. In fact, Cuba is one of the most dollarized economies in the world, and has been for more than a decade. If you try to change dollars for pesos, people look at you like you\u2019re crazy, or American. About the only thing pesos will buy, from the \u201cstate\u201d stores, is dead flies and old soap powder solidified into bricks.\n\nText 2:'i was chewin some watermellon bubble gum yesterday.

It's a given that the play has touching songs and story, so I move on to comment on the production itself.  The incredible amount of detail in each scene blew me away:  the set pieces were well done, the rotating floor kept things moving, and the ad-libbing done by the supporting actors really added to the feel of each scene.  For example, during the scene that introduced Cossette's foster parents, every actor in their tavern carried on audible but unintrusive conversations.  These details gave the scene a lively and bustling ambience.  The person with whom I attended the production noted that I was very quiet.  I had forgotten until hearing observation that I am quiet and pensive when I enjoy watching a movie or play.  I think if something is good and makes me think, it stimulates my thoughts to turn inward, yielding a churning vat of thoughts and observations.  However, it makes me forget to express anything on the outside... funny, eh? :-)"], "gold_label": 1.0}

I'll go by their plans for Iraq.  Bush:   We've seen his rebuilding.  It's boring and it's going too slowly.  Bill Gates:   He'll probably institute a governement full of glitches so he can release Iraqi government 2.0 to fix the bugs, but it'll contain new ones, and pretty soon we'll just have to shut down Iraq and reboot.  The Skeleton:   He'll make all the Iraqis dance for his amusement.  This would be fun, but would probably just lead to a massive uprising the minute he says 'I sleep now'  Palpatine:   He'll likely enslave the populace and force them to build a weapon that he'll use to enslave all the other countries, and pretty soon America would expand and become the Earth Empire, containing every country.  So we can see that Palpatine is best because he will bring world peace.  We'll all be united under one government.  Of course, it'll be a government of evil, but sooner or later we'll be saved by Luke and things will all be ok.

I want to sleep at night... enveloped in the safety of... of something {I'm witholding things again.}  I can't make you understand... I can't make you understand how I can't cry anymore, and I fear I can't feel any more, that I've gone numb from this constant tearing.  I wake up in the middle of the night just in time to silence my coming screams, and in the dieing hours of the night, I remember things that by right are not my own.  I remember the nights I've died over and again.  The nights my wrists were slit, the nights my heart was gouged from between my ribs.  I do not understand this constant turmoil that you have bequeathed to me, why has this become mine, and how shall you save me from it, if you shall.  Why do I not believe a word that comes out of your mouth... why does it seem that each word drips with honey that instead of being golden sweet is bitter bloody red? and yet I long for the nights gone past when I was torn body from soul, and did not know the meaning of the word light, I did not know light or love, but I thought I did.  I thought I did and that was all that mattered.  I was safe locked in the dark dungeons of your heart, buried alive, but safe... and loved.  and that was all that mattered {Isn't it all that matters?}  It doesn't matter.  Nothing does. stumbling across things that remind me of you, the residue that you left, I find the words that made me smile, things I curse you for now, because I find that pieces still ring clear and true, and pieces are lies, all lies...promises made, the things I would never ask of you {or him either}  and I want to cry but I can't... why?  the threats, I've found those too, and I remember why, the swollen lump in my throat, the gasping for breath comes back all over again, and I remember why, I remember the pain... but there's still the pain I bear now, though different.  This pain is dull, like an ancient sword rusted away through ages of memory.  Your pain was sharp,  a sparkling dagger at my trembling throat.  I'm wearied of this hurt, and wish it to be no more...  I know you could kill this pain... but I fear you could bring your pain again as well.  These irrelevant familiarities kill me.  I know you too well, while I know you not at all.  You've always known that... always was a long, long time ago.  I was wrong then, and so were you.  Whose to say that things would be right now? {right now, not the future.}  Not the future, that you would not ask again the impossible of me.  Things you asked... the things I longed to do... the impossible.   and What of my dreams, my hope... my passion and will to live?  smothered and turned away... The trampled roses, blood red that I have nurtured to be more beautiful than before,  They shall not die. I am not quite who I was before.  I have learned not to fear the silence so.  I have learned that it is better to go than to stay, but to stay is neccesary if anything is to be accomplished.  I have learned what it is to be who I am, and I don't believe I could be bent like before {I don't believe, but I doubt, and that is my greatest fear.}  I don't understand.  that is all.  I don't understand.  ...and no, this time, I'm not alright.\n\nText 2:that which is unrequited is not love. {I don't think} and you won't even think of me. all I want is for you to care.

I head on over to  urlLink Salon  to see what's going on today and their banner ad is for a company called  urlLink Godsend.org , a company that specializes in human cloning. Is this for real?  If so, I feel like I'm in the middle of a mix between the Twilight Zone and Pet Sematary. The mission of the company seems to be mainly for parents who have lost their children and would like to clone them:  'Since Dolly, several scientists have cloned other animals, including cows and mice. Now, at Godsend, we have pioneered a technique that allows a cell nucleus from a recently deceased child to be implanted within a human egg, allowing a mother to carry that child to term again.  In theory, this new child would be identical to its predecessor in every way. By creating life from life, Dr. Wells and his crack team give nature a gentle push, and help to rebuild shattered families.'   This raises so many alarm bells and fears I don't even know where to begin provided this is a real company that offers this service. I imagine it is since it's on Salon and the site lists  urlLink testimonials . Why haven't we heard about this before? Or am I really in the dark here? Is this legal?

I didn't call her for 5 days (long time for us) and I didn't answer my phone when she called.  She sent a bunch of e-mails saying she was sorry and that she was being selfish.  We talked two nights ago and straightened things out, but I was very blunt with her and I told her that she made me mad and I won't tolerate girlie games, not now, not ever.  We're square now, things are better between Hillary and I now.  After things were cool, she ambushed me with her mother!  That was unexpected.  It was the first time I talked to her, and I didn't know she was there.  We talked for 30 minutes!  That was strange at first, but then it was okay.  Her mother is very cool.    So that part is covered.... but I'm stuck...  I'm still in this, well, funk.  I don't really understand it.  Mostly I don't care about my life  here , I think and worry about my life  THERE , in the future.  I can think of nothing else most of the time.  My friends!  I have been thinking about you guys and my family and Sara Jean a lot lately.  Very much a lot.  It makes me sad that we've been unable to spend more than a few days with each other over the last .... well, 3 years.  I will be in Iowa this August for a few weeks and I would have to be locked up in jail to not make it to Dubuque to see Sara Jean, and to Osage for the Kershners, and to Milaca to see the Johnsons.  But you fellers know as well as I do that it won't be for more than a few days.  With only two weeks to spend in in that neck of the woods, is doesn't leave me a lot of time to see my whole family and friends.  If I separate from the Air Force this fall (which I'm leaning towards) I'll be moving to AlAskA in September after a visit in Vegas.  It will be a long time before I'm going to be financially stable enough to make it back down to the lower 48.  Maybe a very long time.  I've been wishing there were a way we could work it out between us to spend more time together.    Sometimes I become very unhappy with the direction my life has gone in the last few years.  Especially the last year.  Sometimes I am so unhappy that I can no longer think about anything else...and it takes a long time to shake it.  This is one of those times.  I miss you guys, it would be nice to have you around for all this.  Talking over coffee or beers.    Last night was a great night though.  My Only Floridian Friend, Tim, and I watched some live music (Don's Dixieland Band) at the Java Cafe (Eddie, it's been TOTALLY re-vamped).  We drank coffee and listened to 70 year old men get down on pianos, sax's, base, drums, clarinets, and trombones as if they were 20 years old.  They had so much energy, so much vigor.... then Tim and I walked around downtown Panama City (the Harrison Blocks) and just talked about this and that.  This morning, Saturday, I had a 09:30 mission.  I teched a 2v2 that turned into two 2v2's and the agency that was supposed to release the A/S to me wasn't manned at all today.  So there was A TON of jumping through ATC asses today.  One guy at Jacksonville Missions (JAX) said to me, 'Hydra, I need an answer NOW, I'm going down the crapper!'  So, very exciting.  I'm home now, just a few minutes after 11 a.m.  I don't have any money, and I don't have any plans.  Maybe I'll go out to Books - A - Million for a coffee.  I can work on my book some more today.  Thank you, my brothers, for your concern.  I'm mostly stressed out about the future, I have fear when I look there.  That is what I'm dealing with.

I recently had the chance to interview him and we got to talking about art, politics, environmental sustainability, and relationships. He currently works at a  urlLink Vancouver graphic design studio  and his work can be seen at the  urlLink Alibi Room  in Vancouver starting August 22, 2004 or online at  urlLink Fragile Lifestyle .      kk001 - We\u2019ve seen you shoot photos, paint with oils, draw, build websites, design typefaces, and write on trains and walls, among other things. Tell me about your progression as an artist. Did you go to art school? What is your inspiration?   I went to a high school that really promoted the arts and  had a great instructor. My folks have always been really supportive, as well, encouraging me to do [art] as much as I can. Aside from that, I went to art college for a week before I decided it wasn't for me. It\u2019s a great resource and there were some amazing, talented people who I met there, but my focus has always been a bit more grass roots. I've spent a lot of time learning [by myself] and from other artists I know on more of a progressive, intimate level.   My inspiration has always been the people around me, and I evolve as an artist naturally, I think\u2014as we do physically. I started painting graffiti when I was 14, and became interested in graphic design after the paintings I was doing began taking on a really graphic look. I had first applied that with spray paint. It seems like any art form I try influences the rest of them.     kk002 - What is your favorite medium? How do these different media interact for you as an artist?   I think over the years I\u2019ve grown to understand how a marketable form of art directly influences its environment. All forms of art are marketable to a degree, but the least adaptable to the media, I think, is where I fit perfectly. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the medium, specifically, that gets me going; it\u2019s the message.   I believe\u2014and I\u2019ve said this before\u2014 that a medium\u2014whether it be a paintbrush, a computer, or spray can\u2014is just another kind of hammer you beat the nail into the wood with. It\u2019s really about how you use the medium \u2013 especially these days when a message may be more relevant to its audience than a medium. Of course, then you have to address the fact that some may come specifically to see \u201cthat\u201d medium and, in some ways, you have to cater to that if you want your point to be taken.   A medium, to me, is just a way to reach a different group with the same message\u2014or possibly choosing a medium that would more definitely communicate something than another medium would. Having said all that, I think my guitar is the best medium for me, because I know the least about it.    kk003 - How do you see the difference between the projects you'd categorize as applied art versus those you'd consider fine art?   The only difference to me is the criteria. Fine art is based (most of the time) on my own criteria, where most design (applied art) needs to address the client\u2019s needs or vision.   In some ways, you need to think about response in all cases; but fine art is definitely more open- ended. There\u2019s much more room for someone to react after having applied a twist of their own imagination or perspective, whereas design on a marketing scale is often really specific to the product. Fine art is used within media, but I think it really has a life and purpose of its own.      kk004 - You've had some commercial success with your paintings in Europe. Tell me about that. Who collects your work? How were they exposed to you?   I\u2019ve has some really strange experiences in the past with the work I\u2019ve done there. Some punk bands were really into some portraits I\u2019d done. I had taken a photograph of myself in the men's room at the Gallery of Modern Art  in Glasgow, sent it to [the gallery] a week later, and heard from a friend they\u2019d hung it.   It was shortly after a visit to Ireland that I had received interest in some other paintings from a gallery, and it started there. Years ago I had met a girl from London \u2013 a relative of a friend here\u2014 and did a group of portraits of her in a photo booth.   Those paintings did really well and sort of started the whole theme of relationship for me. That theme has obviously evolved into more specific categories, but, for the most part, still embraces that sense of randomness in personal observation. Recently, I\u2019ve been involved with a group in Italy, and some work has been commissioned, but, for the most part, it seems to be word of mouth or pure luck that sells paintings for me.    kk005 - Do you consider yourself political? How does that manifest itself in your work?   I definitely think there is political context in the work I do, but I am often quite bored with the redundancy of government. It\u2019s a whole lot of drama and half the time the things we hear are not the things that matter most. Even if they had a wrap on things, the majority of the public within that government doesn\u2019t get to hear about it, or [is] conditioned not to care.  Maybe that\u2019s a bit harsh. There are a lot of things in government that have a great potential to influence the way we represent our country, but I think a country that says represent us before you represent yourself is total shit.   A lot of people find a sense of identity in patriotism or in political movements, and that\u2019s good. But I think the real government is not really here to help us know that; its here to offer whatever order it can muster. That\u2019s its job.     Recently, I have been overcome with a desire to talk about environmental sustainability with my work. I think the next step to interacting with the environment you see  as an individual  is to respect yourself as a part of it. That knowledge really influences the way you approach communication\u2014not to mention lifestyle.   I think any political relevance I have as an artist is to inform people that they are still people. They can still make choices\u2014whether it\u2019s voting, or choosing a better loaf of bread. I think we need to be concerned with the lifestyle we choose before we apply that choice to a population of humans around us. On an organized level, there are groups I support like  urlLink Market Trade Fair  or  urlLink Doctors Without Borders .     kk006 - What's the concept behind Fragile Lifestyle? Do you live a fragile lifestyle?   This week has been somewhat fragile (laugh) ... The concept of fragile lifestyle is about relationship. On a large scale, it comes back to the individual, but there is a bit of vulnerability in genuine, honest interaction and you see a lot of people guard themselves from that. I try my hardest to offer a genuine response to anything I see.    kk007 - How do you balance being creative at your day job as a designer with the creativity expressed in the rest of your life as an artist? Do you feel like you use your best ideas at work? Do you ever feel that you are \u201cused up\u201d when you try produce paintings on your own time? Or does work and being around other creative people inspire you more?      It\u2019s hard to compare the two because there is such a dramatic difference between the concept of fine art and design for me. I think my job helps me find more obscure ways of communicating an idea while maintaining a little legibility. But creativity is part of my lifestyle and it keeps me on point, I guess.  It\u2019s the execution of an idea that makes it original, and I feel bringing that balance to  urlLink Burnkit\u2019s  table helps the creative flow in our office. The guys here are really good. We\u2019re a great team who lend skills to each other in an unusually fluid way and I\u2019m inspired by how we communicate about our work internally. Painting is more of a voice; design is a resource. In terms of incentive, my day job motivates me to raise the stakes at the studio and visa versa.     kk008 - Are you currently painting? What are you working on?   I recently took a trip to Alaska, visiting a friend who was working there. About halfway into the trip, I got really inspired to change my thinking about the arts. She-my friend\u2014introduced me to a new world of political issues, as well as deepening my interest in the environment. I am currently working on a series of drawings that explain our relationship with a completely natural habitat, from a totally urban perspective.       kk009 - Tell me  urlLink 'the two things'  about Jeremy Crowle.   1. love everything you do 2. love everything you don\u2019t do    Minutia: At the moment, what is you favorite...

My theory on car colors is that cars should be metallic. White, and black to a lesser extent are not good car colors because they don't shine in the sun. Metallic orange is really going too far though. My favorite color is dark gray. I've never called cars sexy before, but nice sleek dark gray cars really are.  It took me a while to decide my opinion on this orange color. In the beginning I saw far too few of them. But now, i've decided. It's the color of metallic vomit.

From the ERIC Digest:  While many educators are highly focused on state tests, it is important to consider that over the course of a year, teachers can build in many opportunities to assess how students are learning and then use this information to make beneficial changes in instruction. This diagnostic use of assessment to provide feedback to teachers and students over the course of instruction is called formative assessment. It stands in contrast to summative assessment, which generally takes place after a period of instruction and requires making a judgment about the learning that has occurred (e.g., by grading or scoring a test or paper).

Cannon a missionary in Japan about a generation ago.  It is called 'For Missionaries Only' and is full of wonderful nuggets.  Here is an excerpt entitled   Jack of All Trades, Master of None      What is a missionary?  What is he supposed to do?  I have never met a missionary that wasn't  an astute juggler of many balls, a switch hitter who played all the positions, a chameleon called upon to reflect every situation, a variety store, a mulligan stew, a strange mixture of heaven and earth.  think of what a missionary is called upon to do, and what he does.  he is a financier, a public relations man, a fund raiser.  He must be an educator, a personnel director, an able administrator.  he must be a linguist, a translator, interpreter, author, and publisher.  He must be a practicing physician, nurse and first aid man, a counselor, anthropologist, and sociologist.  he is expected to be an English language expert, an ambassador of his country, to have a keen insight inot national and international politics, and alwasy be able to take the right position on any problem that arises.  He is a philanthropist, organizer and operator of benevolent institutions, a lecturer, orator, and teacher of many things.  We might add that he preaches the gospel once in a while, too!   We have a saying, 'Circumstances alter cases,' and this aptly applies to the role of the missionary.  The missionary's own background, education and inclination effect his role.  What a missionary does and can do is determined, also, by how old he is, how long he has been on the field, the education level of a people, the climate of the country, the economic level of its society and the political stability of an area.  All are factors that influence the work of a missionary.     A changing world can mean a changing role for the missionary.  But there is one trade the missionary must be master of to deserve the name.  I want to emphasize that the missionary is primarily a gospel preacher, a bearer of good news.  His work is to save souls.  There should be only one mission for his life, one role that must supersede all others, in order to be worthy of the name 'missionary.'  This is the unchanging role assigned by the Great Commission, 'Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel...'     In too many cases, the missionary becomes a Martha, troubled and worried about many things.  He needs to hear the Lord when He says, 'Only one thing is needful,' and like Mary, choose the better part.  Though he may be busy doing many good things, if he fails to proclaim the gospel, he will see fruit without a tree, light without a sun, water will blow and nothing will remain.  His field of many labors will be a valley of dry bones.  He will have failed because, among the accumulated wares of a life with many roles, he will have left dust-covered, and neglected, the most important role of all -- his mission to seek and save the lost.        Oh Lord, that I would stay focussed on the one mission that supersedes all the rest!\n\nText 2:I have noticed a sharp rise in the number of houses in Ome that have Christmas decorations.

Something that simple was pretty much the highlight of my day.   I was working on some pretty cool web page stuff today. Now that we are only supporting IE 5+, Safari 1.0+, and Netscape 6.2+, I can finally dig into developing some kick-ass CSS and JavaScript laden pages.

And Apple feels that it shouldn't have to keep Safari on Jaguar updated anymore as a way to get people to buy Panther. But they both have the same issues so it's a moot point I guess.

So now that I know it's not just me (it's me and that other guy), I feel better.   I made a quick shopping trip afterwards to get some breakfast food at Copps and was actually quite surprised when I really took a look at what I bought.

They are both blaming one another for different things, when really no one is at fault. What the problem is differences in communication, and perspective (which is often gender oriented). They both tell me seemingly completely opposite accounts of conversations. Jokes become attacks, understatements become lies, and soon friendliness turns into anger.  I'm a postmodernist, so I don't believe in objective reality and believe in only subjectivity.  The problem is that in communication there is the issue of transferring thought into speech, and if that isn't hard enough... there is the issue of the receiver having to interpret what the speaker says. That means that an idea goes through multiple filters before reaching its destination. I think this is an issue between my two friends. Saying what you mean is closer to saying what you think you mean. Correspondingly what you hear is what you think you hear. There is a large communicative ravine between speaker and listeners. This is further complicated by their perspectives on one another and their own emotions at present. This means their subject position is an integral part in how they communicate. Unfortunately I don't know how this can lead to a resolution to their problems. Self-relexive discourse perhaps? However that assumes some level of rationality, and how rational can you be if you 'feel' you've been hurt by someone you care about?  I feel really bad about this and hope they resolve these issues without coming out of this hating one another.  ***\n\nText 2:[15604]  Remember: Ask questions about me in the box to the right and I shall answer here.

This portion of this particular blog should be called 'Attic adeu' or some other cheesy alliteration like that. See, I don't get to sleep until twelve this morning (woah, now it's tomrrow again, must be a growing trend or something) and then I was woken up by a sweet storm. However a lamp was on and I had to turn that off. So I have this totally sweet storm with thunder and lightning and all that other stuff, and I'm to tired to watch it. Then i'm woken up yet again. I'm thinking that it has to be pretty early because my mind is still asleep and my body is kind of getting up, but not really moving, then laying back down. Come to find out it is 8 o'clock. Ugh. I creak out of bed, and I am hustled around the house by little siblings telling me that I am wanted outside. So I go outside and lo and behold the grass is wet. That's ok though, I don't really mind. I find out we are going to mount a satellite dish on the side of our house. Joy. We mount the sattelite on the side of our house with little difficulty, but now we must feed it through the attic into the house. So who gets to go up into the actual bowels of the house and fiberglass? Me. That's ok though, i wanted to go. Here is the cool part, we have this ball that is attatched to the end of a rope kind of thing, and we tied that to another rope, and then i went up into the attic and threw it down to another part of the attic where the cable was. This was my idea by the way...very genius. kind of. Now it is getting pretty hot. It got up to around 95 degrees. So now I plug in the cable to the jack and i come down. Totally awesome view, you can see the skeleton of the house. However, as I said, it is really hot right now. Quickly following after that, I come down, and it does not work. So, we unplug the cable and string down through the house. Now it works because it is the actual cable itself coming straight from the satellite to the reciever. That's nice and all, but we want it to work coming throug the cable jack up in the attic. So again, I go up into the attic and plug in the cable. Now, again it does not work. So again we pull it down through the house. And that's the way we've had to leave it. So perhaps if you know why this might be happening, just leave a comment...or follow the popular trend right now and know what could fix it and don't say anything. Out for now.

Looking around, I can see evidence of this everywhere.  My friend Mike just graduated with his Bachelor's degree and will be moving soon.  I think my cousin Mike may have just finished his internship, and therefore also graduated.  Cricket just got her Master's, got a job, and will be moving to Texas, along with Adam, who was just accepted to grad school.  Jamie just got a job in Chicago and will be moving soon.  Erin is pregnant.  Jessica just got engaged, and is looking to buy a house.  Even closer to me, Brandi is looking for a new job, and it seems like she's close.  She'll be moving back to Bowling Green sometime this summer, come hell or high water.  I think this is how it was supposed to be four years ago, when I graduated.  Somehow, though, everything managed to hold off until now.  I just hope it rubs off on me somehow.  The only real change I'm looking for is a new job.  I haven't had any luck with this, but maybe I will soon.  It seems like something's in the air right now.  One thing that may be changing for me in the near future is this blog.  Blogger re-launched over the weekend, with a significant re-design to their site and some added functionality.  I haven't really looked too hard at what they've done just yet, but even doing a quick skim showed some pretty cool stuff.  I'll probably be experimenting some with it in the coming days, so be aware that some changes may be taking place in this blog.  It's not a new job, but it's better than nothing.\n\nText 2:And the dark horse...     1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?    I liked Spiderman.  I think the fact that he was a kid who got bitten by a spider was cool to me when I was a little.  My brother on the otherhand, liked the Hulk the best.  Maybe it was little brother syndrome...then again, he was also pretty fond of Wonder Woman too.  I never did get the Spiderman underoos, but got a nice olive drab set of Yoda ones.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?    A BB gun.  I had an uncle who got me this scarecrow dart gun set where you shot these rubber sucker-darts at this plastic scarecrow who exploded if you shot him in the chest.  It had other targets, too, but...you know.  We played with it for one day and it mysteriously disappeared, guns and all.  I always wanted to get a BB gun so I could go out and hunt stuff in the backyard.  Never got one...that is, until my brother bot me a BB handgun a couple years ago.  By then, I didn't want to hunt.  Figures.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   When I lived in Los Angeles for 9 months.  It was pretty hard for me and my family.  While I loved living there and working in the industry that I did, it was weird not having the people I was really close with nearby.  When my brother and his girlfriend visited, I felt bad.  I couldn't visit with him for very long and when he left I cried like a little bitch.  Like real hard sobs...or like the Scottish would say: I was greetin' like a bairn.    4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?    How to play a musical instrument.  I had a bass guitar years ago and played the damn thing once.  My 'band' and I recorded our first song, the instrumental 'Burning Down the Ghetto' and that was pretty much the end of it.  I did get an acoustic guitar over a year ago, but I haven't had a chance to learn to play it yet.  I did make some effort, however.  I bought a 'The Complete Idiots Guide to Playing the Guitar.'  How sad is it that I still don't know how to play the thing?    5. What are your plans for the weekend?    Going bowling with some friends and their little daughters and then eating.  Heading out to dirty ol' Mankato so I can look at the place where we're having the reception and also to check out some other potential photographers.  Of all the details I'm the most picky about, it's the picture-takers.  We saw one guy who just took them with a regular camera and get this: let's you keep the negatives.  No thanks, pally.

The test is on Wednesday, we still have 85 years of history and two world wars to cover, not to mention all the stuff we skipped along the way, yet Leonhart thought it a good idea to spend the period watching a video on and having a discussion of African colonialism.  In short, he's doing nothing to advance the curriculum for those of us taking the test.  Part of the problem, of course, is that the test comes way to early in the year, but still, we need to be cramming, not just continueing as if we had all year. Can someone explain to me exactly what these 'Hall Sweeps' are?  I've heard nothing about them at LN.  Yesterday in class Leonhart was talking about African colonialism, and he compared the French colonial government to the SAC, saying that there was a ruling council of Africans, but they had no power.  It's worth noting, though, that Ms. Lupold consulted them on the changes they were planning to the Skip-a-final policy.  I don't know if she'll take any of the advice she gave, but still, they were consulted on something important. Is Erin gonna keep blogging here from Hanover?

It's yummmmy. And it only costs P16.00! Better than a Doritos craving, money-wise. It's really not that bad. You have to try it.\n\nText 2:Sinigang is one of the most popular Filipino soupy dishes. This is a very simple meat and vegetable tamarind-based soup we eat with rice. The most popular meat used is pork (Sinigang na Baboy). For alternatives, one can also use beef, shrimp or milkfish. Other souring ingredients can also be used aside from tamarind. For example, some cooks use calamansi or kamias. They taste just as yummy and work especially well with shrimp and milkfish. I am loyal to the Knorr tamarind-soup base though.  A friend of mine told me that she had experimented with another version of Sinigang --  Sinigang na Tuyo.  Now, 'tuyo' is a dry, salted fish. It is usually fried in oil and eaten with fried rice ('sinangag'). One can also have a healthy serving of tomatoes on the side to add some sweetness to this tuyo-and-rice meal. Oh, Filipino food is yummy. Anyway, Sinigang na Tuyo sounded pretty adventurous so I decided to try it myself this weekend.  My mom's cook had prepared Sinigang na Baboy already, so I just used part of the mixture for my 'experiment.' I had the uncooked tuyo soaked in water first, so the scales could be removed more easily. Afterwards, we mixed in the tuyo with the small helping of the Knorr tamarind-soup base and vegetables. I let it simmer until the fish looked cooked enough.  The verdict? The tamarind-based soup was pleasantly sour, with just the right spike of saltiness from the tuyo. The tuyo was not too fabulous. I think I should've fried it a bit prior to placing it in the soup for simmering. Frying might have given the tuyo a more 'vibrant' flavor.  I could eat the soup on its own. I could eat the tuyo alone. But I couldn't eat the soup and the tuyo in one spoonful. It was just too salty. I've never eaten anything saltier than that dish! I couldn't eat too much of everything for fear of what could happen to my kidneys.   My Dad liked it, though I think he was just being polite. H called it 'Poor Man's Sinigang,' as tuyo is regular fare among the lower-class here in the Philippines. I think this experiment is worth another try, only this time, I won't use a tamarind-soup base, maybe a kamias or calamansi soup base for a less sour taste. I'd also fry the tuyo for more flavor, maybe even make sure the tuyo I get is not too salty -- if that's possible.   P.S. Here's a link to  urlLink the usual Sinigang Recipe ."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I lose half my thoughts in like a second though, I seriously have add, not officially tested, but oh man I do.  Anywho.... so ya I think I have gone quit guy crazy lately, I mean for the first time ever I feel like I have people to actually chose from, that hasn't happened since like jr. high! It's tight, but now I feel like a dumbass 'cause the guy I thought I'd never get, likes me, and ya I like him, but now after spending the day with him, yes I still like him, but the thought of a relationship? I don't know, I don't wanna blow anything that's for sure, but should I really just throw everyone else away? and also right now the friendships I have with people kick ass and I love spending time with them, I don't wanna lose that either. Oy, what to do. Life is messed when it comes to things like that, like you, or at least I do/did, dreamed and like wished to have a one on one relationship with someone forever and then when the opportunity to actually have one comes about, it just doesn't feel right! If that doesn't happen to you, well then I guess it's just me!  I think another problem I have is that it never seemed like people liked me before or something because they didn't think I was hot or whatever, or I don't even know, but ya I always wanted people to think I was like damn hot, and now it's like the opposite, I don't know if people like me because I'm hot and they just want some ass or my ass or if they really actually like me. Like ya I'm always fishing for compliments, what can I say I like attention, but when all I hear is like 'wow your hot' ya it's flattering, but hey maybe you can prove that you like me for me! not for my body! Wow I swear life is too damn twisted like that. Whatever.  Even though I'm confused about it all, ya I'm liven summer, what else can I say, I've got plenty of guys, I get to sleep and hell I get to wake up and actually not know what I'm doing!

But I did stop drinking cokes a few days ago.  EVEN the diet ones.  I know, it's not like I have been off of it for weeks or anything, but at least it's a start.  Even the diet ones, as I've been told forever and refused to believe, pack on the poundage.  Four days of like zero to maybe 1 diet coke, and I loose five pounds, maybe it's not a coincidence.  Speaking of coke, a Texas-ism, or Texism, or taxidermy, er somethin is to call every soda a 'coke.'  So pardon me when I say 'I stopped drinking cokes,' and I really mean 'I stopped drinking anything carbonated and caffeinated.  DO YOU KNOW how big of a deal that is for me though?  I LIVE in a coke (again, that's soda) can practically.  What do I do when I'm planning on even driving across town?  Stop at the gas station for a coke.    Oh good, now onto gas stations, and by the way thanks for joining me on this ride around and around and around in circles that is my mind.  The other day I went into the gas station here by my parents house, and paid for my gas, and that of my brother's on the same card.  The lady behind the counter looks out the window and goes 'that your brother..?'  (in a very half mexican/half chinese accent, I'm not sure WHAT this woman was).  I was like 'yes..' she goes 'oh, he break my friend heart.'  I'm like 'he break your friend heart?  Who your friend.'  Anyway, she goes 'oh I don't know her name, but he break her heart, they supposed to get marry.'  For those of you who don't know,  my brother was engaged to a psycho-bitch for about, oh, 6 months or so.  I hope she stumbles her sorry ass upon this blog-post, SOMEHOW, and reads this.  If you do stumbled upon this, Jessica, make sure to introduce yourself to your 'friend' the China-mexican at the Diamond Shamrock on Austin Highway, cool? cause that bitch doesn't know your name, yet claims ya'll be friends.    Anyway, so it was quite funny that the lady at the gas station knew all kinds of information but NOT really.  Apparently her 'friend' who will be my brother's ex, and my brother came into this particular gas station all the time.  Apparently that made her friends with the girl, yet she doesn't know her name.  I should drop her a lil' memo, that her 'friend' heart get break because her 'friend' be psycho.  Don't take it personally, gas station lady, but they came in there because the station was convenient to their homes, not cause ya'll were tight.  Shit, I've been in there twice since I've been here in Texas, do you think I am now her friend?  She might be rooting me on to law school by now, letting every lotto ticket purchaser know that her friend is on his way to Oklahoma tomorrow.  HELL, maybe by now she's got kids with my name.  Wait she doesn't know names.  In other news, Whoopi does a slim fast commercial now, and the clever phrase is when she says 'if I can be a big loser, than so can you.'  WAIT WAIT, Whoop, does that mean that I can literally be as big of a loser as you?

I learned how to laugh, and I learned how to cry Well I learned how to love and I learned how to lie...  What are you doing Thursday? :)\n\nText 2:Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.  One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post 'war' efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target 'audience' - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I guess the community at Wikipedia has figured out ways to counter abusive, vandal minded, and crankpot contributors.  If Wikipedia ever got big, I think the model Wikipedia would fail.  It would be abused just like Usenet is.  However, as it doesn't get a lot of attention yet, it still works.  Watch out though if it ever gets a decent Google pagerank.

From the ERIC Digest:  'Spreadsheets build an ideal bridge between arithmetic and algebra and allow the student free movement between the two worlds. Students look for patterns, construct algebraic expressions, generalize concepts, justify conjectures, and establish the equivalence of two models as intrinsic and meaningful needs rather than as arbitrary requirements posed by the teacher.' (Friedlander, 1998, p. 383)   Electronic spreadsheets have been created and used mainly as tools for mathematical and statistical calculations, as numerical or textual data can be inserted into their columns and rows (http://wwwstaff.murdoch.edu.au/ ~kissane/spreadsheets.htm). So, being able to manage spreadsheets has become one of the skills sought for anybody in this technologically enhanced millennium. Therefore, spreadsheets have become an important part of many different curriculums at different levels of education. Moreover, they have been used in education, especially mathematics education, as a tool in helping students understand mathematical concepts such as plotting and exploring functions and patterns, exploring probability and statistics, mathematical modeling, and geometric transformations (http://www.freshpond .net/treasures/math/spreadsheet/default.htm). Relationships among different types of representations such as tables, equations and graphs are more easily comprehendible when all representations are visible at once and linked to each other, i.e. when one makes a change in one representation, corresponding changes in other representations are offered by the program. Moreover, spreadsheets allow students to focus on the mathematical reasoning by freeing them from the burden of calculations and algebraic manipulations."], "gold_label": 1.0}

It can then be carried to the local park where you and a friend can perch comfortably until a policeman passes by. Take the opportunity to pick up the bench and run out of the park with it. You will almost certainly be chased by the policeman. When he catches you, you can protest your innocence and produce the receipt for it. If this is carried out enough times then eventually you will not be chased and every park bench will be yours to take, as they will think that you have got a receipt..'  Hehe.  Yesterday, I woke up and went to the Equestrian Center.  For the 11:00 class I sidewalk for a boy named Christopher, who really cannot communicate much at all with anyone and who cannot really do much of anything.  After the class was over, I asked his mom how old he was.  17.  He was seventeen years old.  I don't know why, but that just blew my mind.  Probably I had always just assumed he was like 11 or 12 years old and he can't do anything for himself.  It was just weird, that's all.  Well, after I got home, Jennifer was already there burning cds on my computer.  She had apparently gotten there when no one else was home and just let herself in (because we don't lock our doors) and just got on my computer...then I called Fifer and invited her over to hang out because I hadn't seen her in like two weeks because she went to San Antonio and FORGOT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT :) .  But it's all good.  That was fun.  We watched a movie and ate macaroni and cheese, and talked about...Craig and Ryan...hahaha....we could go on double dates....writing news articles and BUILDING ROBOTS!!!!!!!!  Yes!  Haha.  They are good friends, and we are good friends.  We just need the hookup...ANYway...  So, Jennifer just stayed up in my room the entire time on my computer, which really really annoyed me because what is the point of going over to someone's house if you don't hang out with them???  Well, I had to go see Olivia around 4:00 to see what our plans were so then they both left my house while I took a shower.  In the shower, there is an ant that is like 3/4 of an inch long.  It was crazy...I took one of my old razors and killed it so it would not eat me alive, like the roaches in my dreams...  So I go up to Bowen, find out that our movie does not start until 9:50, and that I am not meeting Olivia at her house until 6:30 or so.  Then since I do not want to go home, I drive to Naomi's house because she called me earlier and I had not seen her since the TAMS orientation.  So we went out and got Chinese food.  That was pretty good...I like Chinese food.  We talked a lot.  It was cool.  I was with her until about 7:00 when I made my way over to Olivia's.  Over there I ate a brownie, played tetherball (and won :) ), and talked to people on the internet.  I accidentally left my nametag in Alex's car on Friday night.  Oops.  :)  We left there around 9:00 and met everyone at the theatres around 9:30 (everyone consisting of three guys that work with Olivia- Mike, Mike, and Stephen).  We saw Legally Blonde 2, which really was a let-down even though it had some funny parts.  So after that, we went and tried to play tennis at like midnight, but midnight is when Stovall closes so that didn't happen.  Soooo we just got some Taco Bell and came home and watched some more movies (that is like four in a day for me...crazy..)  We watched 8 Mile (it was ok...) and Jackass (HILARIOUS and shocking).  It was great fun.  Great, great fun...hmmm...well, that is all.  We were up until 4:00 which I haven't done all summer, and I woke up at 10:00 so I am kinda tired I guess but oh well.

Sunshine, mid 60s and gorgeous!  I just spent sometime outside with my youngest son playing and I was actually warm in my sweatshirt!  What a wonderful day!   The Sacred Romance   I'm in small group with a few other people reading our way through The Sacred Romance.  I'm not sure how I would describe the book.  I really appreciate a lot of what the authors are saying.  It's things I have felt, but never voiced.  But at the same time, they get wordy at times and some of their examples are lengthy and difficult to work through (especially when they use poetry..Ugh..not my strong point).  But something that is sticking with me is what I read last night in chapters 9 &10.  They talk about two roads, one road is straight and you can see a place to stop overnight and the other road bends quickly and you can't make out what's beyond and there are some ominous looking clouds.  Of course the majority of us take the straight road.  Relying on what we can grasp and understand and leave the other road, but we never truly 'know' God.  We can only 'know' God when we venture into the 'unknown'.  Ouch.  How much of my life right now is 'unknown'?  Virtually none.  And right now my heart is screaming 'Isn't there something more?'.  I love my life, don't get me wrong.  I have a wonderful husband, great kids and things are going really well actually.    But I know there is something more...with God.  Something more He wants me to do than simply teach Kid's Church, take care of administrative tasks for the church, lead a small group, and all the other 'busywork' that I have found for myself to feel fulfilled.  And ya know, I'm still not fulfilled.  I think it's time for me to start asking God what more He has, and more importantly be ready to obey when He tells me.\n\nText 2:HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO US!

Friday morning there were just a few people present to see Gurudev off to the airport.  We were in the livingroom watching Rukmini-priya and Prahlad take care of the Deities.  Udayananda brought out my copy of Gurudeva's diary (he's up to Volume 4 now)- he had written in it for me.  As I read what he wrote, I started to cry.  The whole crying part was inevitable, just waiting for a trigger, and that was it.  I got progressively more upset to the point where I had to leave the livingroom and go on in the kitchen.  I cry easily, but it's pretty rare that I get like this, so worked up that I can't really stop.  I tried to find things to do in the kitchen thinking if I kept my hands busy that I'd be able to calm down, but it didn't help.  After a little while, he came out and called me over, and thanked me for the Vyasapuja book and the sweater, and said that the sweater would keep him warm in the Russian winter.  I got some pictures of him holding it, but I had really wanted to see him try it on, and it was sort of breaking my heart that he wasn't.  I said to him (as I was crying), 'Well, maybe someone will take a picture of you wearing it, and send it to me.'  As he was packing up the last bits, Rukmini priya asked me to cut up some papaya for them to take on the plane.  I really had to be careful because I was crying all over that papaya.  The whole front of my sari was wet.  This isn't your basic crying because you're hormonal and there's a sad movie on type crying, this was some full blown hysterical sobbing type crying.  I don't expect you to understand it, and I'm not excusing it.. I'm just giving you a report of what happened.  After I got the papaya bagged up and given to Rukmini, and tearful goodbyes and hugs for her, I went outside and took some more pictures.  The rest of the girls didn't start crying until after he left.  Me, I was on a bit of a different level that morning.  So he went to the airport with my Godbrother Visnujan and Udayananda, and of course Sri Prahlad and Rukmini (my Godsister).  She is just the sweetest, humblest person, and you can't help but love her instantly.  I hope she decides to come back next year.  To make a long story short, I cried for the next four hours.  I got my stuff all loaded up in the car and left there to go over to the temple, and I was the only one present for the noon aroti (worship).  I kept trying to calm myself down, but it seemed like I just couldn't get a grip.  It was so bad that Bala Gopal das, the pujari (person who was doing the worship on the altar) came out and gave me a note with a nice encouraging quote on it.  I must have looked one pitiful sight.  To be fair to myself, I had also just gone five days with a grand total of about twelve hours' sleep, and any military expert can tell you that sleep deprivation does weird things to people.    After the aroti, it was about 1:00PM, and I came downstairs to have lunch.  I sat with Mother Krsnapriya and Saranam, and had a brief (my very first in three years) conversation with Bir Krsna Maharaj, telling him that Gurudeva was very sorry he missed the breakfast they had scheduled.  After this, we decided that I'd stay at Saranam and Lilasuka's house that night.  I was all for the Microtel, because at this point, sleep and the absolute minimum of sensory stimulation was what I was after, but since their apartment was empty, Saranam insisted I come and stay with them.  I turned out to be a very low maintenance guest-I basically did nothing but sleep for almost fourteen hours.  No need to talk to me, feed me, or do anything to me.  Saranam said I was definitely the kind of guest she liked.  I was so incredibly tired, it wasn't even funny.  I slept through the morning program on Saturday, and even through breakfast.  I don't even think I moved from one position.  On Saturday, I came for lunch, did a few chores/errands, looked at a house for sale out in Lake Orange and came home.  Even though there were two more days left of my vacation, it kind of felt like it was all over at this point.    urlLink      urlLink ');'> postCount(' ');"], "gold_label": 0.0}

We shouldn't try to make sinners come to church to get saved in big groups.  Church is a place where we gather and the Holy Spirit is present.  Sinners will never feel comfortable in His presence and we shouldn't try to make them feel so.  Sunday evening was the end of Second Kings.

I added a couple of red asterisks to this photo to help make my point.     The building on the left is the CFMT television station headquarters. In the center, towards the back, is a school. Way to the back is Toronto City Center Airport (TCCA). The building on the right (with the red asterisks) is fake. Those buildings aren't there in real life. In real life, there is a street (Bathurst Street) and a gas station (Esso) on that spot. I guess the movie company didn't want to insert a free plug for Esso, so they added a building into the scene. By the way, I recognize that building they inserted -- 600 Queens Quay West. In real life, it is off camera to the left of the scene.  What's odd is, this scene (and the next two) never appeared in the real movie - just the trailer. Yes, Chow Yun Fat does some spectacular helicopter leaps, but you never get to see any 'background' in them. (I noticed that there are a few other scenes in the trailer that never made it into the movie, probably having to do with backstory.)     Just off camera to the right of this shot, is the City Centre driving range and golf course. What you see in this photo is a pit mine, train tracks (Go and Via) and the west end of Front Street (where the cars are). The yellow building is a surplus store. To the left of that is a Harley Davidson dealership, and to the left of that is a Lambourghini dealership. The only Lambourghini dealer in Canada. He sells 12 cars a year, what a job!     Here, off to the left of this shot, we see the building that was inserted into the first shot. Either Toronto architects aren't very original, placing two identical buildings on the same street, or the movie makers thought you wouldn't notice the same building in two spots. By the way, I live just one building left off camera. Damn, almost made it into the film.     I remember the day they filmed this.     In the background, you can see Scotia Tower (red logo) and Bank of Montreal's First Canadian Place (blue logo). Two big Toronto banks.\n\nText 2:First, let me say what a bad concept this show sounds on paper. Before seeing it, I had my doubts. You take the daughter of a convicted mafia kingpin (and her family) and give them a reality show. Let's reward crime, yippie!  I'll start by stating the obvious.  urlLink John Gotti  is not someone anyone should admire. He was your basic lawless thug, with a touch of ambition and humongous ego. He started as a mob enforcer, which means he threatened people, beat people up and sometimes killed them. He committed violent crimes for a living. He rose through the mafia ranks by murdering his bosses. He died in prison.  (Incidentally, one of Victoria Gotti's brothers was also arrested for racketeering and is now facing a murder charge. Two of her uncles and one cousin are convicted mobsters. Her husband also has some racketeering and tax evasion charges pending. So it's safe to say she was surrounded by crime growing up.)  Even so, let's not smear the good name of Victoria Gotti with her family's crimes. As far as I know, she has was not involved in the mafia and has not broken the law in her life. She seems to want to distance herself from that life. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt on that.  Her kids appear to be both brats and thugs, which is a rare combination. They need their mother to cut their steaks for them, but at the same time have no problem cursing her out when she says 'no' to something. They don't listen to her, and they don't respect her. A lot of fighting goes on, things in the house get knocked over, and the ocassional karate kick into a door. In short, I hate her kids. Seeing them in their life of apparent luxury (and being grateful for none of it) disgusts me. Jack Osborne is ten times more respectful to his parents than these brats, and I used to think he and his sister were pretty bad.  As for Victoria Gotti herself? First we should remember that she executive produces the show. She is the one who voice-overs the sappy narrative. This show is from the first-person perspective - her perspective. There's nothing objective here. The magic of post-production editing can cut the really bad parts out. This is not a documentary.  She starts off by saying people have certain preconceptions about her because of her name. For someone trying to  distance themselves  from the mafia, she sure  acts  like she's in the mafia. She offers a limo driver, jokingly I suppose, $1,000 to dump her blind date in a ditch somewhere. She takes offense to the suggestion that she could not be a good mafia hitman. She spends a lot of time berating a poor construction worker. Of course, he might have been trying to rip her off with his work estimate, and he did put his foot in his mouth in response to a comment she made, but once she got her teeth in him she took a certain amount of pleasure terrorizing the poor guy. He was shaking in his boots (or more likely peeing in his pants) at having offended a well-connected Gotti kid, and she didn't let him off easily.  I'll give her some credit. She has an interesting personality and character that it might (I said might) be worthwhile to explore. She seems driven - what makes her tick? Are we going to see different sides of her? She doesn't seem happy, why is that? Given how the Gotti name is associated with crime, is she doing anything to actively combat that? Is she trying to keep her sons away from that life? There are a bunch of possible storylines here. Only time will tell if any of those things get explored, or if we get the same crap served to us in the first episode.  In short, I don't \u201cget\u201d the appeal of this show. I suppose this would be the reality-tv version of The Sopranos. But watching Victoria Gotti and her brat children makes me sad. I keep waiting for something interesting to happen. But, nothing interesting ever does.   Other reality shows that follow a family or group around have things interesting insights to share with the viewers - The Osbornes, Newlyweds, Making The Band 2, etc. Each gives the viewer some insight into the life of celebrities in various stages of their careers. Ozzy Osborne is an iconic rocker who is now an old man (he can't work the TV remote, how cute?). Jessica Simpson is a young spoiled pop princess, trying to make it as an adult singer (don't offer her buffalo wings, because she doesn't eat buffalo). Da Band shows us how young artists go from nothing to something in a short period of time, and the challenges in handling that (what do you mean I have to work hard to become famous?).   What does Growing Up Gotti show us? She's not actually a mobster, so it's not like this is a real life The Sopranos or Godfather. Noone is going to get whacked. She's a minor celebrity at best (NY newspaper gossip columnist), so it's not a behind the scenes look at fame. There's not much mention of money, so it's not a look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous. What new and interesting insights am I to get here?   The show seems to talk a lot about how difficult it is to be a single mother. Well, that may be interesting to some, but not to me. Plus, I hate her kids, so she hasn't really done a good job of that. For the type of show that it is, a look at the daily drugery of life, they could have picked many more interesting subjects. Donald Trump would be interesting. Mark Cuban. Any kinda-famous actor -- Drew Carey or Ellen Degeneres for instance.  Critics have said this show is a one-trick pony. I suspect that it is. A&E convinced John Gotti's daughter to do a TV show. And all the king's horses and all the king's men, couldn't make it interesting."], "gold_label": 1.0}

The more we listened, the more we realized that, generally speaking, the women who were more likely to want closeness were those who felt, to a smaller or larger degree, that they did not get the attention they needed from their fathers....While our observations were not scientific, we have noticed that many of the women we interviewed who had never married were those who described one or both of their parents are 'intrusive' or 'controlling.'' (try smothered...but in a good way.)  'Most women admit that they've dated 'bad boys' and 'good guys,' and both have their appeal and their own set of problems. Some women we talked to help us identify the types and the sets problems you might expect from either type. Ursula said that bad boys are different from grown-up men, that they are 'more attentive but prefer form over substance.' The bad boys were attentive to being romantic and doing sweet things, so there was never any complaint about the 'trimmings.' Whether they were good people or whether I trusted them was the question. A bad boy is the one you want to pick up at the bar. High on charism, low on commitment.' (oh so true...but oh so irresistible...)   'Yes, it's true. Women are perverse. We like trouble...someone who doesn't need us is a lot less scary than someone who needs us too much.' (amen.)  'Some couples fall apart when the Switch occurs. The Switch is a phase described by Dr. Sills. she writes, 'The most common victim of The Switch is the woman. She was being actively pursued when, suddenly, he turns off just when she turns on...Today, however, sex roles in courtship are much more flexible. It is therefore increasingly likely that she may pursue him until she captures his interest and then --- whammo --- she pulls a Switch and he is the victim.' (hahaha...'whammo!' well, at least now i have a name for it...)  'Perhaps we all dream of catchng the eye of a gorgeous man across the room and, as violins play in the background, watching him move toward us as our heart says 'this is the one.' (um no...what decade are we in??) In talking to women, we found that some of the most successful marriages began, not with love at first sight, but with a resounding 'yuck!'....As the previous stories show, we frequently have a negative reaction to men who end up making a good match for us. The important factor is that we had a reaction, and someone caught our attention.'

I had the great privilege of playing backup guitar and singing backup vocals for my friend  urlLink Jimmy 's church in Philly.  I got up 7 AM last Friday, after which I did laundry and packed for the trip to Philly.  I caught a 1 PM train... on which a man refused to show his ID to the attendant.  We ended up sitting there for about twenty minutes.  This episode made me think again about something I've been thinking about lately... but this something will wait for a later entry.  Jimmy picked me up, and after chilling at his place for a while, we went to the church.  Funny story:  in the middle of one of the songs, I took a step back the wrong way.  My foot bones shifted oddly and painfully, and so I nearly fell over in the middle of that time of worship... heh. I wonder what would have happened if I did... that would have been hysterical :-)  It was a two night engagement, and I wish I could have been in two places at the same time the following day to have had the privilege to join them a second night.  However, I had already made plans to spend time with Jamie from Remnant.  She's a great sister in Christ with a great sense of humor, and it is sad that she is moving back to Seattle next Saturday.  As a goodbye,  urlLink Pika  had spent quite a bit of time organizing a goodbye dinner for last Saturday;  thank you so much, Pika.  I had also heard about a Da Vinci exhibit at the Met, so I thought it'd be nice to spend one last time with Jamie at her and one of my favorite musem.  After brunch at a nearby diner, we spent the whole afternoon there.  The Da Vinci exhibit was interesting, but extremely crowded.  We joined a tour with this guide named James Spann... he was GREAT.  He presented paintings in the manner of a one-man-Broadway show... it was totally unlike any tour I had ever taken.  After tiring our feet out from 4 hours of walking, we decided to get some dessert... but realized that it was almost five.  Of course, she didn't know that the dinner was a surprise from all of us, so we said our 'final' goodbyes.  I walked to the restaurant from Times Square, and called  urlLink Andy , whom was about to go guitar shopping.   urlLink Dan  and  urlLink Tina  were with him, so it was a treat to see them as well.  I gave Andy a forty minute shpiel on the world of electric guitars, after which we left for the restaurant.  Pigalle's hosted about 28 of us that evening.  To my enjoyment, I had the opportunity to meet a lot more people that evening.  However, I was extremely tired from the events of the past two days, so I was quite out of it.  After saying my final goodbye to Jamie and temporary farewells to the rest of the bunch, I took the subway to Port Authority.  While waiting for my bus, I find myself waiting behind two students... one that was about 20, the other in her 30s.  I tutored them a bit in basic chemistry and calculus in the bus.  Ji Young slept over that night.  We stayed up watching some TV and talking about all sorts of things.  He's a great guy, I'm so glad that God brought him to our church.

I've been on ritalin for several years now, but it doesn't fix everything.  Adult Attention-Deficit Disorder (Adult ADD) symptoms are similar, but not identical, to those seen in children and adolescents. The basic categories of symptoms in children are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. People often refer to the adult form of the disorder as ADD, because symptoms of hyperactivity tend to diminish with age, often taking the form of restlessness or fidgetiness (eg, persistent pencil tapping and/or foot tapping) and difficulty engaging in quiet activities. However, the medical community uses ADHD for both children and adults, and this term is becoming more widely accepted.  Until the 1970s, it was believed that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was strictly a childhood disorder, and that children outgrew it in adolescence. Only gradually was it realized that while the hyperactivity component may diminish, the attention and impulsive aspects can persist into adulthood.  Symptoms commonly associated with Adult ADD include:  Lack of focus Disorganization Restlessness Difficulty finishing projects Losing things These symptoms interfere with success at work and get in the way at home or with friends.    urlLink ');'> postCount(' ');\n\nText 2:Well, I should be writing a report for work on my 2 week trip to Japan... so what do I do?

This question is always so hard for me.  There are so many different reasons to meet people.  For golf, I would pick Tiger Woods, Jesper Parnevik and Meg Mallon.  Philosophically, I would want to meet Jesus, Martin Luther or Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Politically, I would love to meet Jimmy Carter, Winston Churchill, Woodrow Wilson or Saddam Hussein (I would at least TRY to reason with the man).  Artistically, I would want to meet Glenn Gould, Jimmy Hendrix, John Updike, Richard Ford or the poets A.R. Ammons and Galway Kinnell.   For dinner, I would want to meet Gertrude Stein, Big Ernie Hemingway (pig on a spit?), Malcolm X and Bill Clinton.  Romantically, I would want to meet Audrey Hepburn (circa 1960), Amanda Plummer (dont ask) Anjelica Huston, Ariana Huffington, Halle Berry, Parker Posey, Bjork, Condolezza Rice or Faye Dunaway (circa 1960).   But, with only one choice, the person I would most like to meet would be Krzystzof Kieslowski the Polish film director.   2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?    This may be lame or boring (how could it be more boring than my last answer, I know, I know, but wait), but, as an AfAm, I definitely would not go backwards.  I also feel that, overall, we get worse globally with each passing year.  I am a bit of a Luddite and I think technology makes us worse, not better.  So, I would pick the present century.     3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?   I would move to Scandinavia or Canada.  I am politically more in line with folks there, and I think that in terms of quality of life, they are on par with or better than America (unless you count culture and food).  But I would hate to move.  I am proud to be an American, and I feel really lucky to be born here instead of many other places.     4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?    Easy, Atticus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird.   5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?

Thanks to my lack of sleep, the rest of my day I was in a daze.  I lost track of what we were singing once during praise time, so there was this uncomfortable wait as I found my spot again in the song.  Praise practice went surprisingly well... I worked the mixer and played bass at the same time.  It was much fun...  Today, Jimmy and I picked up free hats and lunch at the Homecoming game.  Man, it was packed.  we're studying in the library right now, though he's gone back home to get his jacket.  Tonight, I'm going to the KSA banquet... there will be pre-frosh there. Doh.  Sigh.

This is problematic.  This must change.  But what hobby to pick?  I was thinking of joining one of the clubs here, but uncertain which.  There are two requirements, though: first, it should not be something too simple, and second, nothing too dull.  So, yes, stamp-collecting is out.  But what?   What?!?!?!?!?!?   An initial thought was the ancient art of  urlLink kendo , the Japanese art of sword-fighting.  It would be a good way of expanding my cultural horizons, and besides, what all-American kid raised on B-movie samurai flicks  wouldn't  want to do Far East swash-buckling?  But I don't know how good the club in town is, so that becomes a problem.  I had thought about boxing.  But, since my career is going to involve a great deal of thinking, I probably do not want to end up like Rocky Balboa.  Hey, I've spent over 20 years getting my brain in shape - if that's gone, I don't exactly have brawn or looks to get me through.  So, thought maybe about painting.  I have no real experience with it, so it would be challenging.  But is there the natural talent?  While I would like to have the skill to paint like a  urlLink Hopper  or  urlLink Rossetti , very realistic and true to the human form, thus far most my drawings of humans have a closer resemblance to  urlLink Jabba the Hutt .  But, that's a possibility.  But artists can have....well, an odd streak.  If you weren't aware of that, welcome to the planet Earth, please enjoy your stay.  But more to the point, I didn't realize how typical this sort of thing was.  Whether it's  urlLink Tamara de Lempicka  or  urlLink Egon Schiele  being ghastly to their respective families (apparently artistic freedom forgives enslaving those around you), or the general problems with reality of  urlLink James Ensor , or the hideous political agendas of some artists, like the bloody Stalinism of  urlLink Frida Kahlo  and  urlLink Diego Rivera , artists seem to have issues.  And that doesn't even cover their....general laxity with marriage vows and the like.  Huh....maybe I should go into painting.  Be the first bohemian conservative of the next century!  Yeehaw!!!!!!!!!!!  But, that would require energy.  And probably talent.  Well, must keep thinking....any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nText 2:My deepest thanks to  urlLink Seldom Sober , for granting me a link in his presentation of the  urlLink Carnival of the Vanities  (#98).

What the topic will be, I have no idea - might be the jacuzzi atmosphere of East Texas, the connection between modernity and death, or the neurotic worries of lecturers. Guess we'll see.

Hey Matt all ya do is blog away!!!!!! Talk about what you wish and things. Most Mondays / Sundays someone posts a subject to discuss all week. There are a few basic rules which are: a) no blatant or however it is spelt promo for a website (cough david t cough) and b) no excessive swearing unless your in an incredibly evil / mad / depressed mood. Fair? I think so.  Well the ball last night was fab. Jackie, Matt and Max, you sooooo should've come! It wasn't really valentines influenced at all in fact it was just like the leavers ball except it was on a boat and there wasn't as much food. But it was soo good. I got Dean to buy me a drink, go me. It was so fun. Paul looked so loverly :) Everyone looked so loverly. I went to bluewater today with Lisa and my rents. I got some new shoes!

So Im just going to concede that everyone has their own tastes, and leave it at that.  Im crabby today.  As most of you know, I volunteer each month for 3 lousy hours.  For those who dont know, in this time, I help prepare a meal for the less fortunate, aka our friends in the alcoholic/schizophrenic homeless community.  About every 4 months or so, I take a turn and plan the meal.  Meaning, I figure out what to cook for dinner for about 125 men, go to the grocery store and purchase said food items on a budget of about $100 (I am reimbursed for the expense), and bring this meal to a place where I prepare it with about 5 other volunteers.  Its a pain to do, but as I said before, I only do it a few times each year.  So on Sunday I went to the Cub foods that I hate (the one in Edina) and picked up 20 boxes of pasta, 20 jars of meat sauce, several pounds of cheese, a few pounds of carrots (even drug addicts need their Vitamin D, yo) and a huge box of Oreos (drug addicts especially like the Oreos).  Granted, its not gourmet, but you try keeping things imaginative at less than $1/head.  I get the usual stares from people in the store  what?  A girl cant stock up???  pay up, and leave.  Shopping isnt the big headache in this process, folks.  Its the hauling.  As you can guess, the items above are heavy.  And Im one girl.  So after shopping, I load the items in my car.  And then I realize that 20 jars of pasta sauce will likely freeze in my trunk.  And the carrots and cheese probably wont do so hot, either.  So I leave the pasta in the trunk and haul everything else up to my apartment.  Bags are ripped, multiple trips made, but the job finally gets done.  The fridge is full, and Ive got a few bags of sauce to navigate, but its only for a day or two, so no big deal.  This is no worse than the time I had 30 pounds of ground beef bleed all over my refrigerator, but thats a story for another time.  Today I get an email from someone else in the group (who, for the record, I adore) saying she purchased the meal for tonight, so I write back and say, gee, thats great, but I already did that too.    Several of us back-and-forth-ed over what should we do?, and it looks like Im going to have to haul everything over there, and still end up hauling much of it back to be stored by yours truly for a month, at which time I can haul it over there again.  So Im irritated."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Eng Lit is the only exam I ever look forward to you know because I never find them incredibly hard like maths or science. The only problem I had in that exam was that I kep forgetting to start a spiderdiagram or a list of things to include in the essay so each time I wrote the introduction THEN did a small list above that. I think it will be okay though. That lepricorn teacher and another English teacher are so rude! They stood right by my table chatting away, flapping pieces of paper right by my ear while I was trying to work. How rude! They could have distracted me (which they did) and damaged my chances of a good grade! Then the lepricorn put her cup of coffee ON MY DESK. HOW OUTRAGEOUS!!!!! I had a good mind to knock it off 'by accident' but couldn't be bothered. Too much effort really. Good luck everyone!

He bought a copy of  urlLink Surfing Magazine . I took it very calmly and asked if he wanted a 'carrying receptacle.' (why, why)   I wish to make it very clear I did not touch his hands as I gave him his change. Ok? Because, at that point, I had forgotten his name & he was just that 'actor with the drawl.'

It was an ok place, kinda slow on the kitchen side, but manageable.  A fantastic time overall though, as I really like spending time with Ryan because he's nice, talkative, and interesting...which doesn't come along too often when meeting new people.  Hopefully we can hang out some more.  Fun times.  Anyway, after that, I came home and Laura messaged me and said that they were all going to be at Star Bar.  So I got there, saw Chris (keep those drinks rolling Bartender/Security Guard extraordinaire Woodworth), and Paul and Paul came, and then Ryan was there with his one roommate.

Here's what I think is happening: Mrs. Duf is frustrated.  She's under a lot of pressure and as a modern woman, has taken on many roles: 1) Super Mom, 2) Career Woman, 3) Wifey of Duf Fer.  Personally, I think there is more pressure on the woman to be  perfect  at all Three.  Men can slack a bit on #1 or #3 and get away with it because 'they're bringing home the bacon'.  Of course, this is crap, but society (or the horrid media) dictates this.  (Another reason I still wish it were the 50s.)  So when Mrs. D says 'things need to change around here'...you may think she's talking about the order of the house. (Men tend to take things more literally than women.) However, I think she just wants you to be aware that she's going to need your support.  Not just with the vacuuming or putting Tiny E to bed, but emotionally as well.  She needs to know you'll be around to pick up the slack.  Also, you traveling a lot probably makes the Mrs worried about things falling behind at home.

They told me that it would another couple of hours till the service came back. I tried to occupy my time, but it didn't work.

Damian said 'no go' on the rugby match. I'm assuming he means we can't get tickets.  Yesterday was supposed to be a full study day but I managed to spend quite a lot of time pondering about the rugby/grampians dilemma. Also did some planning for Ee-Wei's upcoming trip here - booked a car and accommodation for the few days we will be at Great Ocean Road. Sounds simple but I took quite some time doing it.  Realism. Liberalism. Conservatism. Good. I still remember some of what I did manage to 'study' yesterday. Studying... I've come to realise how foreign a concept that is to me. I honestly don't know what I'm meant to prove in the exam. That I can regurgitate some 'facts' that I read? That I can memorise things and argue from/against that? I will find out tomolo. Seeing as to how I always say time pressure is necessary, I will get plenty tomorrow: three essays in two hours.  Met Penny for dinner. Had mushroom & chicken pizza with penne marinara for dinner at Papa Gino's. Then dessert at Brunetti's. Mmmmm... apple strudel yummy... Headed back to my place and continued chatting 'til just past eleven. Was really good to catch up with her.  Looking forward to Damian's two trips here. He's quite stressed out. Penny and Ingrid will keep him company (or is it the other way around) while I'm at Grampians. Hmmmm... should I leave him alone with two beautiful women?? Still, will get to meet him on Thursday and Monday. And he'll be around again in July.  Almost 9 a.m. Going to have breakfast, get the newspaper, STUDY the whole day, go for the Grampians trip briefing in the evening.  Read Lester's blog earlier. The first time I read it, he hadn't updated for a while. So, I've not gone back to read it for some time. He's been quite productive recently. Came across one of his entries with an icq conversation btn him and Felicia.  Hmmm... Felicia still hasn't called me 'Pin'. She must have forgotten. Or we haven't met recently. Everyone's still in their burrows, head bowed in books. Well, like Lester wrote, people used to call me Pinto. That's probably 'cos there were a proliferation of Kenneths - strange seeing my name in plural - in school and in church. And only he calls me Pin.

Es una tarea dificil, y llenar la vacante puede ser 'tan escurridiza como encontrar el Santo Grial' (Jones 1995). Los distritos escolares estan luchando para alcanzar esa esquiva busqueda a traves de la nacion, a pesar de la falta de candidatos para el cargo de director. En 1998, el cincuenta porciento de 400 superintendentes encuestados informaron que tenian problemas para llenar las vacantes para directores (Educational Research Service y otros 1998).   Por que exite esta carencia de candidatos? Una razon es que un numero cada ez mayor de administradores escolares esta jubilandose. La oficina estadounidense de estadisticas para el trabajo (U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics) estima que en la proxima decada, 80.000 directores se jubilaran o dejaran la profesion (Jones). Otros citan bajos salarios, exigentes horas de trabajo y estres como razones que hacen poco atractivo el cargo de director. La creciente demanda por responsabilidad y la creciente influencia de los padres contribuye, ademas a desanimar a algunos lideres escolares. 'Parece que hubiera ocupado todo mi tiempo peleando,' dice Jim Ford , destacado director que dejo su cargo (Williams 1999).

She loaned her Mom the Firechicken for the evening, so Jenny couldn't drive up to my house. Anyway, I picked Jenny up and we were off to the bar. Arriving at the bar around 10:15PM, we found the actual bar area to be full. Jenny and I ordered up Smirnoff Ices and found a table. About 10 minutes later, two people left the bar so we took over their seats. I had noticed the two guys next to those seats staring at us while Jenny and I were at the table. When Jenny and I got up to sit at the bar, the fat guy (Moose) said to the skinny guy 'They're coming over here'. Nice. Anyway, Jenny and I sat down and these two smooth talkers attemtped to get Jenny and/or myself to show our boobs. Neither of us obliged, so the guys got pissed and left. Party then came over and teased me for chasing the guys off. He agreed that those two couldn't handle me, so it was best they left. Heehee! Anyway, another guy sat next to us, talked with us and bought us some drinks. Party and I chatted quite a bit, and overall Jenny and I had a good time. A lot more went on, I'm just too tired to type it out right now.  After we left the bar, Jenny and I ventured to Ferraro's Restaurant which is a well-known 'after hours' food place.

It's extremely fun comparing how we both evolved from such little chumps to big chumps.   Baby picture viewing is a wonderful bonding experience.

And then both of you smile lovingly at each other, and poof! You go and try to create your own baby. (Just kidding! Really! We parked the album afterwards and watched the news.)  It's different when you look at baby pics when you're married versus when you're just going out. It's somehow more real now.

I get bored with equipment. I feel uncomfortable with too many people around me. This is a cliche, but my biggest competitor is my own self. I can pump my arms faster, stomp harder, jump higher when I work out on my own. It also comes with the fact that I don't worry about looking like a fool to other people, that's why I give it my all.  &nbsp;  I have pretty old VCD copies of MTV's The Grind workout. They are so much fun! I love it because of the dancing. They take the usual aerobic steps and twist them into hip, dynamic ways of dancing. I have other favorites - Karen Voight, Denise Austin, someonewhosenameIforgot, Billy Blanks' Taebo, but I find myself going back to The Grind, just because they're just more fun.  &nbsp;  To stay in or get back in shape, search for a form of exercise that will continually motivate you.

ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Braxton, John M.,  Luckey, William, and Helland, Patricia.  It looks at how the concepts behind Boyer's Four Domain's can be used ti improve scholarship.  From the ERIC Digest:   In his influential book Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate, Ernest Boyer (1990) proposed that the definition of scholarship be broadened beyond the predominant emphasis on the scholarship of discovery to encompass the scholarships of integration, application, and teaching. Boyer's formulations have sparked considerable scholarly attention focused primarily on clarifying the meaning of the domains of scholarship and on criteria and forms of documentation needed to assess scholarship across the four domains (Glassick, Huber, and Maeroff, 1997; Shulman and Hutchings, 1998). This spate of literature and scholarly discussion, coupled with an elapse of over 10 years since the advancement of Boyer's perspective, strongly indicates a need to take stock of this literature. Such a stock-taking requires attention to appraisals of Boyer's arguments by contemporary scholars and various efforts by scholars to clarify the meaning of the domains of scholarship described by Boyer. The ASHE-ERIC Report, Institutionalizing a Broader View of Scholarship Through Boyer's Four Domains, reviews the major scholarly works on these topics. This ERIC Digest briefly discusses the highlights of that ASHE-ERIC Report.   Because Boyer's formulations portray how scholarship should be performed rather than how it is performed, an important question emerges: To what extent do college and university faculty members engage in the work of each of the four domains of scholarship? Despite the significance of Boyer's arguments, little or no empirical research has addressed this essential question. Response to this fundamental question would enable us to gauge the extent to which the four domains of scholarship have become institutionalized into the academic work of college and university faculty members.   The guiding definition of institutionalization used in the ASHE-ERIC Report is: 'the process whereby specific cultural elements or cultural objects are adopted by actors in a social system' (Clark, 1971, p.75). Institutionalization also occurs on three levels: structural, procedural, and incorporation, with incorporation being the highest level (Curry, 1991). We contend that the achievement of all three levels is necessary to sustain the institutionalization of Boyer's four domains of scholarship. Accordingly, we appraise the attainment of these three levels of institutionalization of Boyer's perspective by using data collected from a national sample of 1,424 faculty members in five types of colleges and universities and four academic disciplines.\n\nText 2:urlLink The Election of 1800: Teaching about a Critical Moment in the History of American Constitutional Democracy.    This is a good essay which talks about the first turn over of power after a presidential election in American history.  It also gives ideas for teaching.  From the site:  As America approaches its 54th presidential election in 2000, we take it for granted that the candidate who wins that election -- no matter how partisan or contested it might be -- will become the 43rd President of the United States following a peaceful transfer of power in a familiar ceremony. Indeed, this sense of inevitability is clear evidence of the strength of constitutional democracy in the United States. Aside from the election of 1860, which led to the Civil War, for two centuries America has met the test that a country is an established democracy when it consistently makes peaceful changes of government via free elections (Huntington 1991, 7-9).  But this democratic tradition had to be earned. In 1800 American democracy faced one of its most serious challenges when Republican Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist President John Adams. World history reveals that in all too many cases, political leaders defeated at the ballot have not honored the voice of the people. But America followed a different course. The Federalists handed over the reins of power to their hated rivals, setting a precedent that has guided American politics ever since.  Do students recognize the peaceable outcome of the election of 1800 as one of the most critical moments in the establishment of constitutional democracy in America? The approaching bicentennial of Thomas Jefferson's election is an appropriate time to reflect upon the central place this momentous event should have in the school curriculum. This Digest connects the election of 1800 to the social studies curriculum, summarizes core content on this key event in American history, proposes the use of historic documents by teachers and students, and recommends World Wide Web sites as sources of documents and related information."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I don't know what to feel really.  I get a hot shower tonight!  I'll be clean, but I'll be away from these kids.  No more papoochis.  No more frisbee with Jorge.  No more of Santiago's crazy laugh that I love.  This is it.  If I only knew how much this would torture me throughout the year.  If only I knew that I would think about Mexico every day, that I would dream about Mexico! We say goodbye to the kids from our church.  All the girls are crying.  Morgan comes out of the church, tears streaming down her face, 'I don't want to leave them!'  Either do I.  I guess it just hasn't hit me yet.  But they're crowding around me, asking for just one more papoochi and it's killing me.  My back kills but I can't resist those little faces.  I give Santiago as much as he wants just to hear him laugh like he does.  The way he throws his head back and laughs like a crazy man. Goodbye.  Goodbye Santiago.  We trade our heart name tags.  It's still hanging in my room as a constant reminder of the place I love.  And he runs home.  I wonder if I will ever see him again.  I pray that he will be safe.  Goodbye Santiago. After that we go the other Church for a night service.  Our farewell service.  The way they sing is amazing. You have to hear this woman's voice to believe how amazing it is.  You have to watch them yourself to see how enthusiastic they are.  So alive.  Smiling and singing like they would never sing again.  I wish my church could be like this.  We have a 2000 dollar projector and all this high tech equipment and we can't be half that enthusiastic. The service goes on, but I barely listen.  I can only think about how we have to leave these kids.  They sing Jesus Loves me and that really does it.  I've been fighting back these stupid tears all day.  Jorge gives me a hug and I don't want to let go.  Almost everyone's crying.  I don't know how you couldn't.  You would have to have a heart of steel. We light some candles.  We sing a song.  And it's over.  Jorge keeps running and jumping into my arms.  Over and over again.  I don't want to let go.  But I have to.  Because it's the end.  The end.  Goodbye Mexico.

The only difference is in the real heaven, security guards probably dont ask me to remove my tongue from the display case.  The only real downside was the other people at the exhibit.  There is an area dedicated to U2 fans (zines, etc.) and you can sign a guest book, if you so desire (Desire, get it??  Like the song?).

As a consolation, or additional kick in the ass, depending on you outlook, I was guaranteed a seat on a flight leaving Monday afternoon and given a discount coupon for a hotel.  When I asked where I could get my bag for my impending unplanned for overnight in Chicago, the gate agent finally looked up at me, laughed, and muttered good luck.  I mercifully landed a seat on that last flight, (leaving at 11pm) and got the hell out of hell.  The cherry on top was the earache the flight gave me to remember it by.

What he had told me was nothing very serious, was actually them living together. I freaked and he simply told me he hadn't wanted to hurt me.&nbsp;  We were still having sex. I told him I didn't want to be his dirty secret, that we couldn't have sex anymore. He stormed and sulked and said this meant we couldn't be friends anymore.  After a time he started to come to me saying how she wasn't what he wanted. They didn't have a future and didn't sleep together any longer, he was now just a lodger. From time to time we'd spend a night in a hotel together.  I wasn't dumb enough to belive they didn't have any sort of relationship at all, but I did believe him when he said there was a chance that we could work it out, that I was the one he wanted in the long run.  If I asked about her, or their relationship, he would loose his temper, saying not to ask. If I wasn't updating him on all aspects of my life, he would say that I was jepordising my chances of winning him back. I still loved him, and had always been able to take him at his word, so I told him where I was going, when and who with.  I went on a trip, alone to the States, fulfilling a long held dream. He tried to stop me from going, using emotional blackmail. Just before I left, he told me to trust him and have faith that he'd got wheels in motion for us to be together again. Through out my trip, even though it was difficult, expensive and I often got a sulky or rude response to what was perceved as 'late' contact, I stayed in touch. I held back from things,&nbsp; turned down dates and kisses, thinking that he was really going to fix things for when I got back.   I really am dumb   Within the first week I was back, He'd told me he was going to make a go of things with his new woman.  Within a few weeks of that, he was back on the fone saying there was no hope for them and that, yes, I was the only one for him.   I still really wanted this to be true, I still believed that he wouldn't tell me a lie that huge.

I saw Les Mis (and saw it with a cool person, to boot), saw old friends, and had many meaningful, thought-provoking conversations.  It was bliss to go to a place where everybody knew my name and where I didn't have to do anything to establish a deep connection.  I met many great new people as well and am excited to develop our friendships in the future.  The only bummer was that in my aging state, I can't function as well with so little sleep.  I kept falling asleep during conversations in car rides yesterday and during Pastor Iggi's sermon this morning.  Argghh!  I'm getting old!  All in all, this trip was the best birthday present I had received from God.  It refreshed me and renewed my hope and motivation to work harder at my studies.  Thanks to all who gave me their rebukes and encouragements, for the birthday wishes, for the love.  One love.\n\nText 2:Delivered last March 2004 High School Graduation Our Lady of Peace School As GUEST SPEAKER. ---------------------------  I never thought I\u2019d be back here for THIS reason.  Nonetheless it is my honor to speak before you Msgr. Rig de Guzman, Sr. Felicitas Bernardo, SPC, teachers/admin, parents and graduates.  11 years ago, I walked in the same aisle, wore the same uniform and waited with so much excitement in anticipation for college. I am aware of the similarities we share.  Back then, I was marinated in the same mixed emotions.  Today I share with you something personal before your minds go on vacation mode.  I was not born with a silver spoon.  Every little thing I dreamed to be, I had to work hard for.  OLPS holds a population of those memories, my values being well rooted in this institution.  Prior to schooling, my home embedded these values, thanks to my mom and dad, then OLPS became an investment.    Things took a 360-degree turn in my Junior year.  I was not, and I repeat, WAS NOT thrown into the pilot section, the cream of the crop as they say, icing on the cake for some. While I consoled myself saying, icing is fattening, it was hard enough to be categorized in such a way.  A very inspiring letter from Mr. Jun Lorenzo my sophomore year adviser, a smile and a hug at the HS library from Mrs. Cruz, my 1st year adviser, comforting chats with Mrs. Myrna Fulgencio, Mrs. Gemma Palumpa and Mr. Francisco most of all, welcoming arms of parents when we got home\u2026 those got me, hands down.  Winning isn\u2019t always about who bags the biggest trophy or who wears the heaviest medal.  Victory came on to me in a whole new light. Running 2nd in the race, I was humbled by experience.   My senior year was the most challenging though.  Ms. Lorna de Guzman knew every tear that rolled down my cheeks when I was practically put through the hardest times as SCT coordinator.  There were maybe 7-8 other clubs to supervise, a student body to organize and extra curricular activities like JUNIOR A-FACe, local church choir, catechism in public schools, jazz dancing, DUGSo under my favorite Tita Lolit Garcia, and a lot more to joggle with my 2 hands.  Mrs. Barretto was forever supportive.  She fueled my determination to pursue what I aspired to be.  God works in mysterious ways.  He kept me totally preoccupied until there was no room left for worrying.   At the end of the year, I got the honors I wanted to bring home for my parents, and 13 other souvenirs.  I refuse to call them my medals, only souvenirs.  I went to UP Diliman for college.  Some expected that I will take up medicine.  Others thought I would make a very good lawyer.  Little did everyone else knew, I had a very strong passion for food.  With my parents\u2019 feet up, head rested, and full consent, I pursued a course in HRA.  First day in the university and I had this instructor telling us \u201cgetting into UP is difficult. Staying in UP is even more difficult.\u201d  She was not joking.  I crawled my way out of my math 17 and math 100.  I failed and took my chemistry 16 twice.  No joke.  Nevertheless, I chose to enjoy what I was doing.  I was even challenged to fill up the UP theater for a 3-day-GARY V concert, organize a movie premiere to refill the finances of my orgs. then in drought and hoped to do well in class.  You see, it is not so much on where life takes you, but rather what YOU DO when life gets you there.  So did I end up working in a hotel? Am I now the next BIG thing in selling the city\u2019s most expensive dining place? NO. My knowledge on food preparation is rusty in fact.  The closest thing to practicing my course is perhaps eating and that concludes my career in the food industry.  Family and friends consult me for anything food-related but I have another passion, traveling.  I now work for IASA, a regional subsidiary of KLM ROYAL DUTCH AIRLINES, the flag carrier of the Netherlands.  We handle the marine market for KLM in Asia and the Pacific.   Colleagues sometimes ask if I\u2019m contented calling myself \u201ctravel specialist.\u201d  \u201cWHY NOT?\u201d is a favorite reply.  I was sent away once to man our office in the UK to cover the whole European market for a weekend.  I was sent to train with colleagues in our HOU office only find out that we have more to share with respect to the system KLM has been using worldwide.  The rest of the time I spend here or in other ASIAN countries which we cover.  So you see, it will never be just about your job title but the responsibilities entrusted to you.  Sept. 2003, after my 26th bday, just when everything seemed to be roses and blooms, I was diagnosed with a cystic right ovary. It was different feeling bordering on the thought of losing one of my organs.  Once again, I had to battle this condition with faith.  The same faith nurtured and developed in this school.  My dad was my pillar of strength, my mom, the epitome of undying faith. I gave God an ultimatum.  TWO MONTHS.  Why leave my condition to chance I said, when there is certainty that God makes anything possible?  1st week of December and I went to St. Luke\u2019s on my own, and without even having to take a single pill or medication, the cyst was gone.  So here\u2019s my two cents worth\u2026 Know what you want, and get it.  At the end of the day, make sure you find time to take a short trip --- the distance between your knees and the floor.  I LEARNED THAT HERE.  Whatever God doesn\u2019t give you right now, HE will replace with something MUCH BETTER.  What other people cannot give you, He will provide.  My mom and dad may not be the richest couple now in this city, let alone in our village, but didn\u2019t I tell you they made a very good investment when I was 6 years old?  The person standing in front of you is the product of that investment.  This speech isn\u2019t about me, but about those people in this institution who made me\u2026 ME.   Cherish those times when your school is little, you didn\u2019t have to get lost; times when you had to sit through grueling hours of home economics, that you didn\u2019t have to beg  for the food that you put in your mouth; those times when your subjects were paid for by your parents and you didn\u2019t have to line up at 5am just to lose a slot in a subject that\u2019s mandatory to your course; those times when teachers are caring enough to tell you how to pass your subject than chase a professor who tosses class cards in the air to determine your grade.  This is the world out there, a little scary perhaps.  LAHAT NG BAGO NAKAKATAKOT SA UMPISA, pero HINDI LAHAT MAHIRAP HANGGANG SA HULI.  Your faith will define who you will become.  11 years from now, one of you will take this stand and speak before another batch of OLPS\u2019 finest.  Make sure you take them to a refreshing trip down memory lane. It\u2019s always good to be back HOME. Heads up graduates but keep feet flat on the ground and wherever they lead you, be sure to take OLPS with you.  From someone who\u2019s been there, done that and back again, CONGRATULATIONS!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

I've been busier dyin' than livin'.  I can't function like a normal person, it feels like I'm play acting survival.  All I really see are plates spinning in the air without my help, with most of them already falling to the ground.    What makes it this way?  I don't know how to explain this, but my mind is just overloaded with too many thoughts.  My mind is glutted with so many thoughts, worries, concerns, and I can't turn them off.  And underlying everything, since the dawn of my memories, stands a fear of life that controls the puppet strings of my actions.  I'm wondering if I really am a spineless, scared man that can't think for his own.  So, I try to fight, I try to recognize the reality of God's sovereignty.  It's at this point I realize that my problems seem to stem from an absolute lack of sight upon God.  The Gospel of Jesus doesn't do anything for my heart.  The concept of love is alien to this stone weight that resides in my chest.  I pray to Jesus, asking Him to be my fountain of life.  He said to drink, so here I am.  What does it mean to drink?   What is the action of drinking the water of Jesus?  Do I stand outside and open up my mouth?  Do I sit in a yoga position, empty my thoughts, and wait for something mystical to occur?  Do I go out and serve the poor, do I just go on with my daily routine?  Do I do nothing and watch the sparks fly?  Do I really know what it means to love, to adopt someone else' welfare as my own?  Why can't I submit resumes on time and get interviews like any normal person?  Why can't I just shut everything off?  I want to be mindless for once, but it all rushes in from all sides.

I'm so tired of bitching about it, but I'm feeling it like novacaine tonight. Maybe it's the weed, maybe it's how dry the house is when it's empty. Maybe it's how little time I try to spend with this new gelatinous version of my formerly enigmatic self. I'm like a mole hermit now, detesting the light along with civilization.  I just popped a sleeping pill capsule all over my hands..... *Ech*  So this is not a lovelorn letter to our adolescent losses. No this is something much more binding. I miss her like a kidney, like an amputated limb I can still feel tingle and burn. I miss her like my insides have slipped out and slithered away. And it's not really all her, some of it is legend that has brewed in my mind with a few years of alcohol abuse and denial. It's an acute loss because I have lost a part of myself. I am whole and complete with her here. Even though she's home on Christmas, she's home a week in the summer, we fall so quick-click back into place. I finish her sentences, she encourages our debauchery. We are the only ones that smile and clap with glee for destruction. She is the only one that brings that childish confidence to the surface, which leads me to the logical conclusion that I am my most beautiful and radiant with her. We are compliments to each other. We shine and glitter. And I always thought she was the weaker one, I was the overbearing- at times overtly obnoxious- dominator, but I am the one floundering. She has eased into her new role, her new climate, her new time zone. She has spread herself further and blossomed. She has become what we always talked about. I can only wonder why I am still tooling the same dirt, still breathing in these chemical fumes of failure.  This all occurred to me when Mike and I were discussing the Naked Fire Fairy Dancing that had come to Kristi and I so naturally. It was like the culmination of this wretched past two years of our long distance friendship. It was a sort of purge and rebirth.... Even if to the outsider it was just a couple of naked drunk girls gyrating and dancing to Muddy Waters around a camp fire. It was so much more to us. It was a forgiving. So Mike and I were talking and he says that this is something that he expects from me, something that is so fundamentally me that he can't believe that he hadn't noticed how docile I had really become. And it is not mendacious. It is meant with love, I think. But it is a slap in the face because I miss this person that I was, or am. Or could still be. I miss this person that she brings in me, summons me like a snake charmer and there I am more lovely and streaming like water. I am a force to be reckoned with and to be seen and heard. But when she leaves I deflate and I am invisible once more. I have lost the people I loved once, the interesting ones. And it is my doing. All but her.  All those engaging, interesting people that captured my heart as quick as my mind and then one by one I pushed them like foul bile from my body, from my emotions. I left them to wait and burn and simmer in their anger and I never cared. Because I had lost her. They're existence paled in comparison and I was blind. Crystal still won't speak to me. I miss her beauty. I miss what she taught me. I miss being eighteen years old and her explaining me why I wasn't quite as racially as open minded as I wanted so badly to be. But she helped me learn. She taught me there is no color in words on paper, there are no boundaries in stories, there is no exception for excellent writing, and mostly she taught me I was capable of it. But oddly enough I don't miss her. She turned sour somewhere along our journey and I became her easiest enemy. I became the one to blame for her loneliness, for our lack of communication, for our lack of common ground, when really it was the conducive alcohol that had ever drawn us together. Now sober and expecting that electric connection, well, now we bleed disappointed with how dull the other one really is.  My point... Where did my point go? It's elusive in this haze. It's dancing in front of me behind pale labia-pink veils, but I can't quite make it out. I guess to simplify this very long entry.... I really miss her."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Shes the ultimate woman/blue creature.   2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?  Off hand, I cant think of anything I wanted for myself.  (On the same wavelength as Duf) My brother wanted a go-kart since the moment he could talk.  So sometimes I would ask my parents for a go-kart for Christmas/Birthdays since I thought Id have more seniority or something because I was older.  That never worked.  We never got a go-kart.  When my cousin did we were green with envyand that bitch never let us drive it.  That still makes me mad.   3. What's the furthest from home you've been?  Bangkok & Chaing Mai/Rai in Thailand  the most gorgeous place on earth.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?  Ive always wanted to learn an Asian language, but I dont know if Id have the patience for it.  And I still need to learn to drive stick.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?   Whats with this question every week?  Im going to see a punk show tonight at the Elbo Room, looking at a condo (possible purchase??) on Saturday, Comedy Sportz tomorrow night, movie on Sunday.

As a lapsed/alienated Catholic, I actually come down on the side of Catholic conservatives on this one.  It seems to me that a central aspect of any religion is to decide what are its central tenets and who is or isn't a believer, based on those tenets.  Don't get me wrong--I wish the Church would rethink some of those tenets, but it's not my place to tell the Catholic Church what it can and can't do regarding its own rituals and observances.  If John Kerry or any other Catholic politician differs significantly with the Church's teachings, why don't they just honestly say so and then find a different church?    It seems that both sides in this debate want to avoid a massive self-inflicted wound.  If the Church started to deny communion to pro-choice adherents, politicians and otherwise, they would risk a schism.  Likewise, if pro-choice politicians fessed up that they no longer believed in some of the central beliefs of the Church and were therefore leaving, they would risk alienating Catholic voters.  Unfortunately, the result is hypocrisy all around with both sides pretending to believe in something they don't.\n\nText 2:As predicted yesterday, there is now substantial evidence that Keyes is, in fact, running.

Working 'two days' this weeks has turned into five days - with a double shift on Friday.  I expect that when I get my first pay check I shall be, as they say, 'rolling in da money.'

Just the essentials, you know?  Wal-Mart at 5:30 in the morning is interesting.  The cleaning guys were shouting random Dave Chapelle phrases at the top of their lungs.   My favorite part of the day has got to be before the park is actually opened and I get to climb this long ladder and flight of stairs to do safety checks.

Jenni is really nice, and probably the one who talks to me the most.  Lyndsey is really nice.  Becky is cool too.  Donni is cool.  Ferrell is...ok I suppose.  I guess the guy that has intrigued me the most so far is Greg.  He reminds me so much of someone, but for the life of me, I cannot think of who it is.  There are just some people that intrigue you even without you really ever being in a conversation with them.  I haven't talked to him save for the work conversations, but for some reason I find myself trying to figure out what kind of guy he is.  I wonder what kind of music he listens to, what his friends are like, what school he goes to, if he still lives with his parents, what his clothes look like when he is not in uniform, what he gets like when he's crazy or drunk or around people he knows really well.  This creates much entertainment for my mind throughout the day.    This is so much better than Kroger.  I didn't even feel like I worked 10 hours today.  HOLLA.  Lisa"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Saturday  Got up early to go to my dress fitting.   urlLink Julia's  Mom is truly an artist.  My dress looks so much like my grandmother's, I couldn't believe it.  After the fitting, my Dad cooked us one of his famous brunches (eggs, bacon, toast, the works....mmmmm) and then insisted on driving us by the scene of this huge accident that took place near where my parents live.   urlLink Read the article here.   A gasoline tanker truck crashed, spilling thousands of gallons of gasoline and scorching the better part of an entire neighborhood.  Then it was on to meet with our minister.  We snuck into the back of my old church to watch Merle officiate a wedding ceremony, and afterward Kevin and I were able to have a brief meeting with him about our own wedding.  Even he said it would be bad professionally for me not to include my church choir at our wedding.    Sue and I headed to  urlLink Park Place Deil  for lunch, where I had what I consider to be the best egg salad in the entire city of Rochester.  It was such a treat!  Shortly after, Kevin and I left to come home.   Sunday  This by far was the best day of the weekend.  After church, we packed up the car and the boat and headed down to the lake.  Yes, it was a little chilly, but we were heavily bundled.  Once we got on the river and the wind died down, so it wasn't too bad.  The sun was out, we were with great company, we had on some great music, and  the water was so relaxing with the sun shining on us.  We cruised up and down the river for about 4 or 5 hours, till the sun started going down.  For the first time in a few weeks, Kevin and I were stress-less, which is a fantastic feeling.  It makes you realize how insignificant little things like stupid arguements are, and how in the grand scheme of things, really all that matters is your own happiness.   So, in the words of Bob Marley,  'Let's get together and feel all right.'\n\nText 2:Gemini May 21 - June 20 Relations with partners of all kinds - business, romantic, creative - might be somewhat strained today, dear Gemini.

YAY!  i think sometimes i get jeolous of couples who are getting married.  one of my coworkers (from another department) just got engaged on valentine's day and i straight out said...'wow...i'm jeolous!'  right after i said that, i was like...'oops...did i say that out loud?'  i felt so dumb!  but when ross and mary got engaged today, there was no ounce of jeolousy in me!  i was and am genuienly (sp) happy for them!  i guess it depends on if i know the person or not.  i don't really know that coworker well enough to really care for her and be happy for her!  hehe..cruel huh?  however, i do know ross and mary and i know that they deserve all the happiness in the world.  therefore, i am so happy for them!  i can't wait...i wanna help out with their wedding plans!  hehe...more bridal shows to go to?  hehe............i had such a great feeling today!  they both made me feel good!  i'm happy that one of our friends is finally getting married.  i've never actually gone to a 'friend's' wedding before.  hopefully i'll be invited to this one!  hehe!  i found it funny cuz earlier during the baby shower, mary and i were talking about weddings/bridal shows without having a clue about the proposal!  that was the best...  so, after that romantic event, andy and i went back to jack's party.  i got there happy cuz of the proposal!  jack was so out of it!  yes...the alcohol!  =)  he ended up leaving the party to go to sleep!  poor him!  we just hung out at the party for a while and now i'm home.  YAY!  it was such a great night!  i know...i'm too corny!\n\nText 2:This will probably sound weird but I miss Andy.  We haven't had time to ourselves for a while!  We have just been busy with everything and everyone else, I guess.  This past Wednesday, Andy took a half-day just so he can take my NY neice to the airport.  Isn't that nice?  Hehe.  I was supposed to take her but it's much easier for Andy to leave work earlier than it is for me!  If I did, I'd have some MAJOR catching up to do.    The little outting with my coworkers didn't happen last night.  Everyone was planning on going but for some reason, at the last minute, a majority of the staff had something else to do.  Isn't that sad?  They planned a goodbye/goodluck dinner for that guy and that didn't even happen.  Actually, yesterday was probably a bad night, even for Tony because something's wrong with his knee.  Apparently, he went to get it checked out that night and it just took longer than expected.  We ended up still going out around midnight with that guy that left and two other coworkers.  It was alright!   Anyway, I just got back from spending the day with my friend, Grace.  Andy went to work today so I went to Carson by myself.  I had to go there because it was Jackie's son's 1st birthday.  I ended up just tagging along with Grace, Tony, and Gavin!  After that party, Grace and I went to Lynce's grandma's birthday.  It was cool...esp. since we got to see Lynette and her kids!  I haven't seen them for so long!  I'm also excited because I get to see them again tomorrow.  My friends are having a bon-fire so that's my plan for tomorrow.  Andy wont be able to go because he already made plans to go to his friend's house to work on some landscaping in the backyard.  Oh well.  I'm sleepy so GOOD NIGHT! =)"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Now the  urlLink Boston Herald  is reporting that the accused priest Paul Shanley claimed in 1995 that he had been sexually abused in the seminary himself by another priest and one of the predecessors of either Cardinal Law or Cardinal O'Connor:   Shanley stated in a Sept. 25, 1995, letter to one of his clerical supervisors, Rev. Brian Flatley, that he was himself ``sexually abused as a teenager and later as a seminarian'' by a priest and by the ``predecessor to one of the two cardinals who now debate my fate.''   The unitiated will imediately presume that he is referring to Medieros or Cooke the immediate predecessors of Law and O'Connor, but since he says that he was  a seminarian at the time it could be someone else. Anyone who preceeded Law and O'Connor in Boston and NY would be considered their 'predecessors'; Cardinal Cushing would have been the Archbishop of Boston when Shanley was a seminarian, he was succeeded by Cardinal Medeiros, in New York Cardinal Spellman would have been the Archbishop of New York when Shanley was a seminarian, he was succeeded by Cardinal Cooke (whose cause for Canonization has been introduced by Father Benedict Groeschel). In regard to Medeiros, there has already been  urlLink one story  accusing him of abusing someone. It received little attention at the time it was released, partly because it seemed pretty lame to accuse someone who is not around to defend himself.   An amazing document that has been released by this Shanley incident is a  urlLink letter  that was written by Cardinal Medeiros to Cardinal Seper in the Vatican in 1979. In it Medieros says:   'Where large numbers of homosexuals are present in a seminary, other homosexuals are quickly attracted. Other healthier young men tend to be repelled.   In the letter itself, he claims that this was the case in Boston but that they had cleaned it up. This is the first time, to my knowledge that we have any public admission (albeit after the fact) that the hierarchy was aware of this problem. If Medeiros was a guilty party, one wonders what he really was doing to clean it up.\n\nText 2:A new web site, I couldn't find anyone claiming responsibility for it though... urlLink Main Page"], "gold_label": 1.0}

The best thing about it was the crowd...mostly in their 50s and 60s, some still tokin', and so excited to be there.  I kept thinking how psyched I would be if in 30 years DMB had a reunion tour.  I guess that's what Sat. night was like for those grown-up hippies.  There were some noteworthy outbursts of enthusiasm: two times, when the entire crowd was seated, there would be one individual in one of the first few rows standing up busting a move all by him/herself (probably secretly hoping to be invited up on stage).  The first time, no one else joined in, but during 'Mrs. Robinson,' pretty much everybody got up to shake their tailfeathers.  I just have to say, Paul Simon does write some absolutely incredible songs, but he certainly isn't very nice to Art.  Poor brillopad-hair Art kept going on about their friendship and how great Paul and his songs were, and Paul would be like, 'Yeah I know.  I am pretty cool.  You on the other hand...'  That may not be verbatim, but that was the general feeling I got, which was disappointing.  At any rate, it was one of the coolest concerts I've ever seen.\n\nText 2:&emailalert=no&email=adgrant@indiana.edu&url=http://closeproximity.blogspot.com&name=Proximity&bgcolor=003399&fcolor=FFFFFF&link=FFFFCC&words=comments&title=Comments &width=350&height=350'>   With all the political turmoil going on right now, I'm feeling a little ranty (Not a word, I know).

I don't know how to best put this into words... with my parents... I know them - they are at the point in their lives where they know enough about themselves where they are who they are... and I know fairly well who they are. And I trust that in the months between my leaving and coming back for any special events, they will still be the same parents I know now.   But as for my brother and sister... especially my sister - its so incredibly scary to leave them behind. She is young enough to change drastically in those few hypothetical months... and I don't want to not know my baby sister... it would kill me. I wish she (Mandy) and Nick (my brother) didn't have to stay behind... I wish I could pick up my whole family and take them with me -  hell , this state is so cold and ugly six months out of the year I don't know who wouldn't want to leave.     The past few weekends I have been spending sundays in Onsted with my family. The last time I was home Mandy wanted to go car sledding. What is car sledding you ask? Take a rope... tie it to the back of a car or truck... grab a sled and have fun.  So the three of us [Nick, Mandy and myself] drove behind my old school since it was one of the only places that still had a good layer of snow on the parking lots. Thanks to the nights before of slow rain; everything was under a thick sheet of ice... it made it much easier to do tricks while being dragged: like spinning around in circles at twenty miles an hour. Fell off a few times but it never hurts (unless you unexpectedly get dragged into an iced over pile of plowed snow... ouch). But it was alot of fun... and it will be one of the only things I miss about winter.  But in closing: I will miss everyone I am leaving, my mom, my dad, my brother, all of my family. I will miss you too, Mandy. More than you will ever know.\n\nText 2:On my 21st birthday, Amanda and I had been dating for almost three months, and as a present she got me Ypsi [the hamster], along with a class cage [that was her sister's old 6 foot long snake cage... but it made Ypsi kinda' crazy, so he was moved to a small er  cage pictured below], some wood-shavings, food, you name it, she bought the whole set up.   I named him, Ypsi, cause that's where we lived at the time: Ypsilanti, MI. He loved sesame seeds, liked to sleep wedged in-between the glass and his running wheel, and always managed to get himself stuck under and behind things when exercising his plastic ball. Today while I was at work, Ypsi died in his sleep, curled up in his smiley face coffee mug.     Above: Ypsi, taking a breather on his exercise wheel, this was taken shortly after I moved in with Amanda, over a year and a half ago.   This morning Amanda noticed the fur around his mouth was yellow, as if he had gotten sick, and his back legs looked like they could barely hold his weight. In hamster years, he must have been in his 80's, he was only a few months away from being two [human] years old, which I think is kinda' rare for a hamster. I'm glad he made it to California, it was nice to have him keeping me company in the car those 2,500 miles...   Amanda and I buried him at the bottom of our apartment stairs, in the garden. He's off somewhere stuffing himself full of sesame seeds and running on his wheel in the sky. Rest in piece, Ypsi. You we're a cool little dude."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I met so many wonderful people, discovered so many things about my hubby as a child, was warmly introduced to his wonderful family.   I have to say one thing that struck me the most about Moroccans were how physicaly beautiful they were. They had such ranges of beauty as well. From fair-skinned to dark-skinned, from Latin looking, caucasian looking. The only thing missing were Asian looking ones!  Filipinos are beautiful too, of course. But everyone from the Philippines must have the experience of being in a 'palenke' (wet market) or a particularly poor area, and seeing the weather-beaten, haggard, faces of our working/poor class, their hardships etched on their faces.    When I went to the wet market in the Northern area of Morocco (close to the Spanish territory), their vendors, their poor, were so gorgeous.  Gorgeous faces, with great skin, brown, even blue and green eyes. They were the equivalent of our mestizas, I suppose, their blood comingled with Spanish ones.    Here are some of the beautiful children I came across in Morocco: Unsa and Wafa, niece and daughter of my sis-in-law's housekeeper.

We all have to work hard to make everything add up just right.  In the U.S. the average household holds $8000 in credit card debt alone, so I guess a lot of people are not having an easy time making expenses and income equalize. One type of business booming across the U.S. today are payday loan businesses, where they extend you a loan against your coming paycheck.  This is supposed to be done for emergencies, but analysts have found that these payday cash advances are used for anything as trite as going shopping or a spa getaway.  The interest on these? Anywhere from 200-1368% APR!  Think this is exaggerated? Google 'average interest payday loans' and you'll see countless articles verifying this.   Has America gone insane?  Or is it just a fact of life manifesting itself in a way that capitalists can take advantage of; that of limited resources, unlimited wants?  Or maybe P.T. Barnum said it best when he said 'There's a sucker born every minute.'  We may shake our heads at people who go to these lengths to pay bills, but the truth is, most people don't know where their money is going. You can itemize the big ticket items like your rent/mortgage, car, insurance.  Unless you itemize every single penny you spend for a month of two, you won't notice that you spend about $500 a month on that cigarette habit, or $1200/month on eating out for lunch, or $1000 on clothes.   When I started keeping track of my expenses on an excel spreadsheet, I didn't know I spent almost $800 a month on items I marked as miscellaneous.  Things I didn't need.  The hardest part about being on a budget is that you can't lie to yourself and tell yourself you've got a couple of hundred dollars left to do this and that.  Your bottom line on that damn spreadsheet is telling you that you don't. So I can't tell myself that I can spend whatever I want on this upcoming San Diego trip. I have to be on a budget.    The best part about being on a budget is that you can't lie to yourself anymore and dig yourself deeper in debt. If you lie to yourself anyway, then you're just a sucker."], "gold_label": 1.0}

This ERIC Digest is by Kathleen Porter.  It shows how valuable a college degree can be financially.  From the ERIC Digest:  The escalating cost of higher education is causing many to question the value of continuing education beyond high school. Many wonder whether the high cost of tuition, the opportunity cost of choosing college over full-time employment, and the accumulation of thousands of dollars of debt is, in the long run, worth the investment. The risk is especially large for low-income families who have a difficult time making ends meet without the additional burden of college tuition and fees.   In order to determine whether higher education is worth the investment, it is useful to examine what is known about the value of higher education and the rates of return on investment to both the individual and to society.\n\nText 2:urlLink Ulysses S.

Now, I'm not talking about liking that drink in particular, but The Drink.  The Booze.  The Pint.  The Occasional Snootful.  The Elixir.  Then I thought  why ?  Why do I like it so?  Let me tell you.  The drink makes you feel powerful.  Sexy.  Vulnerable.  Relaxed.  Crazed.  Energized.  Sad.  Depending on what you drink, you can feel all these things at once.  Margaritas make me feel festive.  Wine makes me feel calm.  Beer makes me laugh.  A Vodka Tonic is my equivalent to speed.  So along those same lines, here's the  Thursday Three :   1. What's your favorite drink?  Why?  Flavored Stoli and Tonic.  I was  way  into this before all the cheap versions of flavored vodka came out.  What I'm really saying is, I invented this drink.

Hal once posed with one of their numerous dart trophies.

You also don't have to dress up to go there.  It's where everybody knows your name...or at least your favorite drink.   3. When was the last time you were really hungover?  Discuss.

The party was on a Thursday night, making the hangover feel even worse because I was supposed to go to work on Friday.  But I didn't.  I took a totally legitimate sick day.

How about this lame-o Friday Five.   BTW, there are no rules this weekend except ONE: What goes on in the Twin Cities  stays  in the Twin Cities.  That's all I'm sayin'.   1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?  I like talking on the phone if I have juicy gossip or to plan an event for the weekend.  I usually don't call people just to chat.  Bor-ing.   2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?  Kellie - we're excited to get the hell out of dodge and head to God's Country.   3. About how many telephones do you have at home?  One cordless, one cell.  Whatever.   4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?  I absolutely hate people with call-waiting.  When someone says 'Hey, can I get this other call?' that basically means 'You're not important enough for me to talk to'.  I don't ever use the call waiting I have on my cell phone, and I don't have it on my cordless at home.  If someone really needs to get a hold of me and he/she hears a busy signal or gets my voice-mail, the person can call back or leave a message.  C'mon people!   5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?  Depends on the situation.  If I'm dumping a guy, I try to call and let him off easy - it's the least I can do.

I think it is well written.  From the entry:  'In its most general sense a library is a collection of books and other reference materials. The term is usually used to refer to a public, school, or institutional library. Such a library is open to consultation by the public, students, or patrons or employees of an institution, and often features a reference desk. Many libraries (called lending libraries) make at least some of their books available for borrowing, so readers can use them at home, over a period of days or weeks. As well as books, many libraries are now repositories and/or access points for other media, such as maps, microfilm, microfiche, audio tapes, CDs, LPs, video tapes, CD-ROMs and DVDs, and have facilities to use the Internet.'    Etymology of the word    'The word is derived from Latin liber, which means 'book.' Derivations from the Greek Bibliotheke (from Biblos, book) are used in at least German, French, Spanish, Swedish, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Dutch. Other languages, such as Icelandic, Finnish, and Estonian, use words that derive from their own words for book (Bokasafn, Kirjasto, and Raamatukogu, respectively).'     Library management    'Basic tasks in library management include the planning of acquisition (which materials should be acquired), library classification, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile materials such as manuscripts), borrowing, and developing and administering library computer systems. More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones.'    Library instruction    'Many users do not know how to use a library correctly. Fear and anxiety are common in some users. An entire movement has sprung up to advocate library user education. The common term is library instruction.'

From the site:  Well-nigh universal opinion holds that Franklin Roosevelt was the greatest president produced in twentieth  century America, a perception grounded on his energetic battle against the Great Depression, his leadership in the last Good War, and his expert marketing of a genial personality. But proof of his actual achievements is more difficult to deliver because he was careful to leave little in the  way of a paper trail.   He kept control of his administration by making decisions from day to day, sponsoring bickering and rivalry among the bureaucrats, and using unofficial agents. He discouraged note taking at cabinets, and left no memoirs to enlighten us. There are worse ways to control a government, but it left critics free to charge him with major-league chicanery,  i.e. guilty foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor,  on the one hand, or to foist on him an enthusiasm for their own favorite causes.   While his role in any particular policy or transaction is often hard to pin down, it is clear enough that FDRs grasp of the Pacific world was seriously flawed. Originally, he followed the prudent course of avoiding a Japanese war. for which the country was ill prepared, but eventually he had to face it, and suffer the Pearl Harbor disaster. Many of his ideas were out-of-date. The deep prejudice against Japanese of any stripe which allowed him to set up the Japanese Americans as scapegoats for Pearl Harbor was only one of his bizarre notions about races and peoples. As a self-appointed naval expert he was often a nuisance to his admirals, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff ran the Pacific war pretty much on their own. Because he seriously misjudged Chinese capabilities, FDR paved the way for the disillusionment of postwar years. He also misjudged Stalin. The country might have been better served  had he been able to retire in 1943, when he had become seriously ill."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming!

Stepchyshyn is an Assistant Professor, a Reference Librarian, and Chair of the Library.  From the Introduction:  This article discusses the information-seeking behavior of students in a large urban university and the impact that behavior can have on the development and delivery of instructional and reference services.  This study was conceived to be a tabulation of student responses to information-needs.  What developed was a realization of where we, as reference and instructional librarians, fit into the academic lives of our students. The information we received brought to light something that we had long suspected and secretly feared.  As a whole, our perception of the importance of the library in the academic lives of our students was miscalculated.  In this article, we endeavor to discuss both the information-seeking behavior of urban university students as well as the challenge that behavior poses to our own concepts of instruction and reference services.  This small amount of paper cannot match this herculean task, but it should serve as a platform for discussion and further research."], "gold_label": 1.0}

From the site:  High atop one of Cincinnati's most prominent hilltops stands the large yellow house where William Howard Taft was born and grew up. Located in the once-affluent suburb of Mount Auburn, the two-story Greek Revival house is a reminder of the elegant era when those of means could escape the dirt, heat, and crowded conditions of the lower city. Although attractive and comfortable, the house was quite modest compared to the many splendid country villas found along the slope of Mount Auburn and on the summit. During the mid-19th century, Mount Auburn was known as the city's 'Fifth Avenue.' Among the many examples of architecture were elaborate Second Empire homes with their two distinctive sloped roofs, rambling Italianate villas belonging to some of Mount Auburn's wealthiest residents, and Georgian Revival houses reminiscent of the grandeur of the southern states.  Walking through the neighborhood, one can imagine the sounds of horse-drawn carriages making their way up the steep hill to return well-to-do Mount Auburn residents to their homes. Now nestled among modern service buildings and other mansions that have been preserved, the Taft House reminds us of the boyhood and upbringing of a man whose career was dedicated to his country.\n\nText 2:A fascinating story via  urlLink Dogfight at Bankstown  through  urlLink Pharyngula  about the  urlLink terror  a woman felt when travelling on a US domestic flight with fourteen Syrian musicians.

Once back in the jetway or gate area, security typically would inform the passenger that, \u201cthe crew does not feel safe with you onboard,\u201d the only articulated reason for the removal being a \u201cfeeling\u201d of discomfort on the part of someone else on the plane.

Instead, I get a book with coupons to fill out and mail back to get these 'free' gifts.  And some of these 'free' gifts I actually have to pay for to get.  Altogether it would cost $142.65 ($20.75 is shipping) to get everything in the book.  This just shows yet again how these programs work.  They lure you in with offers for free stuff and stick you with the bill.  And one good trick I found with them is their free leads.  They say you can get free leads each month.  The only problem is you have to call a phone number, and it's not toll-free.

(Surely, a decent man would appreciate a woman of modest appearance and humble breed.)  as soon as I pulled into his driveway and saw him coming towards my car, i realized that my awesome powers of deduction had failed me, big time.   i guess i could sum it up by saying that he's a mysterious-adonis-by-night-full-blown-pimp-daddy-by-day kinda guy.  at the club where we'd met, i distinctly remember him in a sleek leather jacket over a simple black top.  for our afternoon date, the man was decked OUT.  i don't even know where to begin...maybe with the tan suede jacket fringed by faux mongolian fur that he had to  special order  from an obscure boutique in nyc...or the finely tailored shirt with distinct couture print...or the turquoise Dior sunglasses...or maybe i should just jump right into the bling-bling around loverboy's neck  and  his fingers.  as you can imagine, i was abso-friggin-lutely mortified to be trapped in my cotton gap tee, tattered blue jeans, and imitation dr.scholl's sandals by way of target.  all i can recall from the drive towards the pier in his topless mustang is that i was feeling very very resentful.  there was no doubt in my mind that this man had breached the first-date code of fashion conduct by dressing as he did.  in fact, he specifically misled me to believe during our prior phone convo that he was a real chill and earthy kinda guy.  has the man no scruples??   on account of his good looks, I could have  easily  forgiven him for his smoking/drinking/drug habits, to say nothing of his faltering sense of direction, his dainty appetite that made me look like a starved elephant by comparison, his swollen ego, his frequent use of profanity and porn, and the fact that he had nothing in common with me.  but quite simply, the man had out-bling'd me on our very first date, and that fact alone is a travesty i find so reprehensible as to preclude the possibility of any future to be had between the two of us, period.  so in conclusion, the answer is an emphatic  YES!\n\nText 2:i can't sleep. travelling is stressful...especially with a parent. over the course of the day, i've been asked to confirm the placement of my ID card, plane ticket, hotel confirmation, and extra cash (a whopping 15 bucks! quick, somebody get me a safe with extra padlocks!) about a ka-jillion times, to the gad-zillionth degree. i'm trying to be very zen about the whole thing, but one can only take so much before falling off the brink of sanity.  i found out today that i got into cornell. it's been my first choice ever since i got this law school idea stuck in my head. for a while, cornell was all i could talk about, and my close friends (poor things) will readily attest to my unhealthy fixation. i literally carried the school's admissions brochure with me everywhere, and i mean E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E, busting it out at luncheons, dinner parties, birthday parties, whenever and wherever it was deemed most inappropriate. i was so obsessed that i'd take the virtual campus tour on the cornell website every single night before going to bed. that's how badly i wanted to go to cornell law school. and nobody understood why. not even me.  naturally, i was pretty happy when i read the acceptance email. i immediately started having these visions of myself strolling across the lush hills and quaint bridges with breathtaking views of the town's many gorges and waterfalls...or reading a victorian novel while floating idly in a canoe over lake whats-its-name. somewhere in these idyllic scenes, i think i was also being serenaded by the birds singing overhead: tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet. but then it occurred to me that i'd probably have to go to class sometime, so i looked up some stats on the actual school, which i'd never done before, and i swear to gawd this was the first thing my eyes landed on:    Racial Composition of First Year Class . . .

I am interested in a position that will allow me to combine the talents I have developed in both computer Engineering and Communication Engineering along with my strong customer handling and communication skills.  However, as you can see from the attached resume, I have extensive experience in many related fields, and I always enjoy new challenges.  I feel that it is important for me to maintain a practical, real-world perspective while developing my academic abilities. I am proud of the fact that I have financed my entire education through scholarships and summer jobs related to my field of study.  This work experience has enhanced my appreciation for the education I am pursuing.  I find that I learn as much from my summer jobs as I do from my academic studies.  For example, during the summer of 2003, while working for PC INTERWORKS the system centre for FUJITSU SIEMENS COMPUTERS, Staffordshire I gained a great deal of practical experience in the field of electronic circuit logic and driver design, microprocessor assembling (most of them were INTEL processor starting Pentium 3 to Pentium 4) and 3COM wireless networking components.   I was dealing with UK and European Customer return of Fujitsu Siemens Computers and I was sorting them for possible problem and put them in an order for repairing and No Fault Found department. My work was based on customer\u2019s problem with the brand new computer and gives them the best and possible solution over phone, email or face to face. When I returned to University in the September last year and took Computing and communication engineering, I found that my experience with PC INTERWORKS had thoroughly prepared me for the subject.  I love to study and work on communication field every time and which was a passion to me from my childhood. I thoroughly enjoyed my jobs related with WTP, WTLA, WSP in PENTASOFT, Bangladesh. I even started talking the terms of Mobile communication in my everyday life.  I have a strong knowledge on Mac OS 10.2.2 Panther. And I am confident on sorting any problem of Mac whether it relates with software or hardware.  Having said all this, I realize that your first consideration in hiring an applicant must not be the potential educational experience your company can provide, but the skills and services the applicant has to offer.  I hope the experience and education described in my resume suggest how I might be of service to any company.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss with anybody how I might best assist any company in fulfilling its present corporate needs. I am looking forward to the employment opportunities in your company  for Full-Time in confidence with my education, experience, and interests.

we saw scorpion king!  it was definitely entertaining.  something bout the rock..everytime i see him- no matter if its on tv or like a poster i have to succumb to my urges to catcall.  i dunno- i think its definitely something about his charismatic presence u know?  and the movie definitely had funny parts in it..like the part with the ants..HAHA.  i think my favorite part though, was like in the end when he's fighting with the bad guy and the bad guy like cuts his shirt! i was like oh no! be careful! and then the bad guy cut it again! and i was like oh NO!  be more careful! but then the rock just looked at his shirt, and pulled the whole shirt off..and i was like..ah..yes...that was nice....hehe.  i dunno what it is..  sunday me and kareen went to the driving range with andy and will.  i used to think that i really really hated golf, but it actually wasnt that bad this time..i really suck though, but hey thats to be expected..but im getting better really i am.  the funniest part was like, well, im in the stall next to will's and im getting frustrated cuz the damn ball is so hard to hit! and will can tell im getting frustrated ( it might have been something to do with the profanities i was muttering..) but he turned around to watch me to give me support right? ahah, so i attempt a swing, and will is like, wow- that was a nice hit- as he watches a ball go soaring pretty far..and im like- uh..the ball's still here...i had missed the ball...well it was funny at the time!  i cant believe school is going to be out in like a month!  so crazy. i got to start cracking for finals.  i hope i can get into all the classes i need for next semester.  did u know for engineers that full time student status is 12 units as opposed to like 15 or 16 or something for regular majors?  interesting huh.  next semester im taking 3 upper division courses..im not sure if i want to take anything else.  its eecs150, ee126 and ee122.  i have my schedule planned (hopefully it will stay that way) so that i dont start class until like 2 and friday's i have no class. lovely huh.  i'd rather have classes in the morning though, but these courses like mostly are in the afternoon.  but thats nice, at least i get to sleep in! but it also means no more rides to class from will..but oh well!  vegas is approaching!  well not really, but i like to think it is.  so silly- will is going to vegas like beginning of july for a bachelor's party. i want to go!  we're planning on going with kareen and andy like middle of july- which is funny cuz will would have just have went.  i hope he doesnt blow too much money at the bachelor party weekend thingee...cuz we got to save it to blow when we go!  oh another of our friends tina and her bf jeff are going to go too i think!  its going to be lots and lots of fun!  i want to go clubbing maybe one night, but mostly i just want to play blackjack.  i love it!  and kareen is addicted too now.  im looking forward to this trip for 2 reasons:  1) something to just look forward too! my light at the end of the tunnel!  and 2) going with like people we're really comfortable with- it makes it really fun u know? like u dont have to be like really worried about like oh are they having fun or yadda yadda yadda u know?  it's going to be fun!  first time i went since i got into college was 4th of july 2 years ago.  it was really spontaneous.  i dont even know how/why we decided to go..but me and will went just the 2 of us.. we saw mystere and stayed in treasure island and went swimming and stuff.  it was really fun- but i was 19 so i was paranoid about being carded, but i never did get carded even though will did! ahah.  and the last time i went was for my 21st bday last september, we went with this other couple michael/stephanie and it was fun too! but i didnt get to do as much gambling as i liked..even though we gambled ALOT!  that time we stayed at treasure island for 2 nights and venetian for a night- it was a 4 day trip..really nice and not rushed.  but ok.  i have an appt. at tang center today. blah.  i hate annuals!  but first i just gotta get through my ee lecture.  i want to start my cs homework as soon as i get home from tang today, cuz i want to go to henrys tonight with kareen/tina.  hopefully it wont be too crazily hard.  my ee ta is sooo slow at posting grades up..i have yet to find out how i did on last week's ee midterm!  im so happy we dont have ee lab this week though.  i am SOO fed up with ee lab..theres like one more left, and i really dont want to do it at all.  like i've been slacking on the last couple too.  its just that this ee lab is so pointless- like i'd rather have a lab that is more handson- like my last ee lab.  this is all matlab.  i hate matlab.  die matlab!  ok im going to get movin' now..read some of my next ee chapter..joy...hope it doesnt get too scorching hot today!!  byee!\n\nText 2:wow another week has passed so quickly!   real quick so i wont forget~  monday morning me/kareen went with will and his parents to look at wedding places!  yup!  we went first to friendly hills country club, which is the country club (private) that they live next to - they live in the friendly hills gated community.  it was SO nice!  im sure i've mentioned it before- but it was where they had filmed that scene from 'bringing down the house' with queen latifah and steve martin!  yah!  i was already pretty sold! but next we went to the pacific palms- which is the old industry hills sheraton.  no comparison.  we had an appointment afterwards to head out to the universal hilton (next to universal studios) but we were just pretty sold on friendly hills that we decided not to go.  monday night i hung out with my best friend connie from high school!  me/kareen actually first headed over to another one of our high school friends' place- karen- at her apartment she lives with her bf in silverlake, close to downtown LA.  it was def fun looking at old pictures and catching up!  afterwards the three of us went over to connie's place in west la- she lives right off the 405 and hung out a bit at 3rd street promenade.  me/connie did some crazy shopping at sephora! so fun!  then we had dinner at this peruvian restaurant- i dont remember the names, then had some drinks at cafe muse near connie's place.  it was lots of fun!  i definitely am happy and thankful that after all these years, me and connie are still wonderful friends. i think we've both definitely growed and matured since our high school days. :)  oh yes, when we got back home we went with my parents to pasadena to see those streets that are crazy decked out in lights for christmas- but it was so late that like 90% of them were off! :(  tuesday.  hm. dont really remember what we did during the day.  oh yes, me/kareen went with my dad for lunch to this place in rowland heights that is supposedly REALLY known for its clams dish.  unfortunately i HATE clams!  but i bumped into a hELLa old friend back from my YEARS and YEARS of orchestra- lee!  it was really good to see him!  so weird and random!  def someone im glad i bumped in with!!  def someone i want to keep in touch with!  but tuesday night will picked me/kareen up and we headed out to san marino and met andy at our friend heidi's place.  her bf peter (another good friend of ours) was visiting from shanghai and we all went to old town pasadena and had dinner at bucadibeppo!  very fun! then we walked around, and FROZE and got coffee at coffee bean.  we ended up calling it an early night just because i think we were all just SO tired!! it was def great hanging out with them cuz 1)peter is never here- hes in shanghai! and 2)even though heidi is in berkeley for school, we dont see her much cuz shes so busy studying and we're busy not! :)  yay so definitely happy we had a chance to see them!  wednesday.  new years eve!  hm. oh yes i remember!!  my mom had a half day at work, so me/kareen and my dad picked her up and headed up to crystal lake in the angeles mountains!  its somewhere we used to go alot when we were younger, just to see snow and hang out.  but like after an hour of driving, we come to the road being closed off! can you believe it! and the sign was saying something about like its closed cuz its not safe due to damage from the september 2002 fires! DOH! why didnt they tell us that before! so that was definitely a bummer.  we headed back and bought some fishies for their fish tank! kissing fish! ooh they're so cute!  then will picked me up and we headed down to tustin to my friend shirley's place (whos visiting from taiwan!).  ah and the night began! lets see got there around 530ish, and helped shirley make some spinach dip and stuff.  and cheese fondue!  then milan and kareen/andy got there and we pigged out on like chips w/salsa and guacamole and bread with fondue and spinach dip!  we had 730 reservations at this place south a bit called 'rockbottom' (?) which was set up for new years- its at the irvine spectrum- and like that night dinner was like set price and you got to pick an appetizer, an entree and a dessert.  8 of us (me/will, kareen/andy, shirley/milan and jeff/joan) were there and man those appetizers were HUGE!!  i cant believe everyone got one.  we had SO much leftover food.  oh yes though, the alcohol consumption did begin there.  then we were sooo stuffed we headed back to shirleys place, tried out the new eyetoy jeff/joan had gotten us for xmas and celebrated the new year there with champagne toasts!  very lovely.  oh yes, there involved a tequila shot for me that ended very badly. BLAH!  oh yes, then the poker tournament began.  SOO not my night.  only $5 buyin cuz they didnt really play, unlike us we play so much!  how embarrassing that i did so badly!  i was the first to leave $5.  i bought in another 5.  then i lost ANOTHER $5.  then i bought in a third $5.  hey it was only $5 increments and hours of fun- and thats just one hand of blackjack right!!!?  anyway, end of the night, i had lost my $15 but will ended with $30 which minus his original $5 and then covering my lost $15, he made $5.  wow will! :)  we finished playing about 6am, and we all headed to bed.  except CRAZY golfers will/jeff decided to go play a round of golf! worked for me, i got to sleep on the MOST comfortable couch seriously- in the WORLD.  it felt seriously like a giant marshmallow.    next morning- well same morning, kareen/andy met up with our friend tina for lunch, which i wnated to go! but i couldnt cuz they werent planning on coming back to shirleys place and i couldnt get a ride back cuz will wasnt around!  i woke up maybe noonish and showered and all, then me/shirley/joan made omelets,blueberry muffins/sausages/and a fresh fruit platter! ok well i just followed the directions on the muffin box. :)  but still what a fun breakfast!  then we watched tlc's marathon of 'clean sweep' and i felt really motivated to get back to berkeley and clean!!  and then we all fell asleep. hehe.  we woke up maybe like 6ish? and headed out for dinner- and ended up at the 99 ranch nearby (a japanese place they wanted to go was closed for new years) and i ate some pork cheek.  ok so it wasnt that bad. but still! hehe.  then we hung out at this boba cafe afterwards.  it was amazing how many caucasian people were there!! by the time we headed home, i def felt the warm/fuzzy feeling of having good friends to share good times with. :)  friday.  finally the catering manager for friendly hills was in!  oh yes, monday we went the general manager had shown us the place cuz rosie (the special events manager) was out sick, and she was again not there tuesday or wednesday and thursday i guess she was off.  we went with kareen/will and wills mom.  i was DEF glad wills mom was there cuz rosie didnt want to let us do what we wanted to do, which is what the general manager had said we could do- which was to use the upstairs dining area (beautiful window views of the golf course) and the downstairs patio for the ceremony.  she said we had to use the downstairs dining area if we wanted to have our ceremony cuz that place opens right out to the patio!  but its not as nice! thankfully wills mom was really assertive and got her to consider it and then we bumped into the general manager and wills mom was really nice to him and he said- yup we'll work it out! joy!  then me/kareen rushed to rowland heights to have lunch with my parents and their family friends and one of their sons.  i gotta remember to forward my resume to the dad- hes in the ee business- keep my fingers crossed!  then we went home and ..napped! haha!  friday night will picked me up and i had dinner with his parents at their place and we did wedding discussing!  then home again i went and hung out with my parents and watched a movie and stuff at home!  saturday morning (today! wow i made it to today!) we met up with rosie again and signed a contract for booking their facility for september 18th, 2004. OMG its SOOO close! 9 months!!!!!  then me/will headed out to west LA to pick up shirley and had brunch with her and jeff/joan.  then we went to their cherry sky films office.  its RIGHT next to where my friend connie lives!  anyway, at their office- it was so cool! like i see HUGE things happening from this office. they're going to be huge!! then me/will/shirley hit the road to head up here.  on the way- bathroom stops! gilroy kenneth cole stop before they closed! in-n-out double doubles!  then we had starbucks at union city!  it was def fun having shirley drive up with us- we dont get to see her enough as shes in taiwan so much so hehe we had her all to ourselves for many hours.  we are finally home now- home sweet home!- and unpacked mostly but i wanted to update real fast so i didnt forget before i got into bed.  yay! happy holidays! 99!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

'A jade figurine, partly uncovered from a tomb in the Pyramid of the Moon near Mexico City, appears to be carved in a Maya style.' - The New York Times   This means that the two cultures of Teotihuacan and the Mayans had contact with each other. Up until this point, Archeologists were looking to find a link, if any, between the two. This is very exciting news for me, since I am interested in all things Pre-Columbian.  On a somewhat weirder note, yesterday my neighbor left a piece of mail out for me that had been mistakenly put in with hers. It was a letter that turned out to be from an inmate at a prison (delivered to my home address!) asking if I would write to him. He said that a Deacon at my parent's church had given him my address and so he sent the letter. I called my mother right away, and she called the deacon, and the deacon said that she had never given out any home addresses, but then they realized that in the Church bulletin they print change of addresses. And the church bulletin is sent to everyone, including these inmates at the prison that are associated with this letter writing program.  My father writes to someone, but the letters get sent to the church, and then passed out to the respective people. Nothing is ever mailed to his home. Well, this was quite scary for a while last night, but I guess I'm not supposed to worry because he doesn't get out of jail until 2015. Small consolation when I think about what he must have done to be put in jail for so long in the first place. WEIRD.\n\nText 2:urlLink fridayfive.org     1.

I'm talking about the new game  urlLink Prince Of Persia: Sands of Time . If you want you can  urlLink download the demo here . I don't usually play games like this, but this one is an just too great to be passed. It's developed by  urlLink Ubi Soft , which means Splinter Cell video engine. It looks so nice. Not to mention the camera angles in this game are actually good unlike all the other games in this genre. There is a complete zoom out mode, which really helps. The puzzles aren't that hard, the fight scenes are awesome. Oh my god :@ You control time! Or at least the ablity to rewind. Unlike most other games which would abuse this power and turn it into a GOD-MODE type, this game is very different, you can only rewind time with the sand you get. Hence the sands of time. Anyway, you get the sand when you kill an enemy and drain them of their sand or else they will come back to life, or from this fountain thing... The demo is great, the only problem that I have with it is that you can't save, but that's probably what make me want to play it oh so much. I think I am at the end now, there isn't anything to do or anywhere to go... I just run around in the broken down court yard.

An interesting piece of information.......  Have a look at the wrapper on a *oca-*ola 1.5 liter bottle and in the ingredients label you will find phosphoric acid in it. Minute quantities of ethylene glycol are also used (which is acknowledged in the soft drink world for making it really chill).  This is popularly known as anti-freeze which prevents water from freezing at 0 deg C and instead drops it 4-5 degrees with minute quantities. This chemical is a known slow poison in the caliber of arsenic.  So, if you manage to drink about 4 liters of *oke within an hour or so, you  can  die.  Read along and give up these dangerous things. Be natural; have  flavored milks, tender coconuts, buttermilk, lassi and plain  water instead of these 'soft' drinks. Guess what's the pH for soft  drinks, e.g. *oke? pH 3.4! This acidity is strong enough to dissolve teeth and bones!  Our human body stops building bones at the age of about 30. Soft drinks do have any nutrition value (in terms of vitamins & minerals).  It is high in sugar content, carbonic acid, chemicals i.e. colorings etc.  Some like to take cold soft drinks after each meal. Guess what's the impact? Our body  needs an optimum temperature of 37 degrees Celsius for digestive enzyme functioning. The temperature of cold soft drinks is very much below 37 degrees or even close to 0 degrees Celsius. This will dilute the enzymes & stress the digestive system. The food taken will not be digested. In fact it will be fermented!  The fermented food produces gases, decays and becomes toxin, gets absorbed by the intestine, circulates in the blood stream and is carried to the whole body. Hence toxin is cumulated in other parts of the body, developing into various diseases.  Think before you drink *oke/*epsi (or any soft drink) again. Have you ever thought what you drink when you drink an aerated drink?  You gulp down carbon dioxide, when nobody in the world would advise you to drink CO2. Two months back, there was a competition at Delhi University 'Who could drink the most *oke?' The winner drank 8 bottles and fainted on the spot-too much CO2 in the blood. Thereafter, the principal banned all soft drinks from the college canteen!  While this might have been an extreme measure, their results do provide some food for  thought. Did you know that soft drinks use chemicals in them that cause immense harm to you. Someone put a broken tooth in a bottle of  *epsi and in 10 days it DISSOLVED! Can you believe it? Teeth and bones are the only human parts that stay intact for years after death. Imagine what the drink must be doing to your soft intestines and stomach lining!   ===8"], "gold_label": 0.0}

After a day of work, I always, ALWAYS have spare change in my pocket. I have a coin purse in my bag but still loose change finds it way to my jeans pocket. I think if I do the Dance of Joy (remember  urlLink Perfect Strangers ?), a certain jingling and chiming would help keep the beat of the dance.  Solution? The money box. We bought a really nice looking wooden box from  urlLink Landmark  (Cheap finds! Value finds!). Whenever we arrive home, we head for it and empty our pockets. As of this morning, I think there was about 30-something pesos in change there... a mix of 25 centavo coins, 1 peso coins, 5 peso and 10 peso coins.  The other good thing about it is whenever we're in need for spare change, we don't have to go looking under the couch or in the pockets of my office bag. I need spare change whenever I ride the cab or when I need to get coffee from the vending machine at work, so our money box is a big convenience. Meanwhile, I'll work my way up to putting in paper bills in the money box sometime...  (I still do the Dance of Joy in my weird and wacky moments, but the jingling and chiming's all in my head now.)\n\nText 2:Sinigang is one of the most popular Filipino soupy dishes. This is a very simple meat and vegetable tamarind-based soup we eat with rice. The most popular meat used is pork (Sinigang na Baboy). For alternatives, one can also use beef, shrimp or milkfish. Other souring ingredients can also be used aside from tamarind. For example, some cooks use calamansi or kamias. They taste just as yummy and work especially well with shrimp and milkfish. I am loyal to the Knorr tamarind-soup base though.  A friend of mine told me that she had experimented with another version of Sinigang --  Sinigang na Tuyo.  Now, 'tuyo' is a dry, salted fish. It is usually fried in oil and eaten with fried rice ('sinangag'). One can also have a healthy serving of tomatoes on the side to add some sweetness to this tuyo-and-rice meal. Oh, Filipino food is yummy. Anyway, Sinigang na Tuyo sounded pretty adventurous so I decided to try it myself this weekend.  My mom's cook had prepared Sinigang na Baboy already, so I just used part of the mixture for my 'experiment.' I had the uncooked tuyo soaked in water first, so the scales could be removed more easily. Afterwards, we mixed in the tuyo with the small helping of the Knorr tamarind-soup base and vegetables. I let it simmer until the fish looked cooked enough.  The verdict? The tamarind-based soup was pleasantly sour, with just the right spike of saltiness from the tuyo. The tuyo was not too fabulous. I think I should've fried it a bit prior to placing it in the soup for simmering. Frying might have given the tuyo a more 'vibrant' flavor.  I could eat the soup on its own. I could eat the tuyo alone. But I couldn't eat the soup and the tuyo in one spoonful. It was just too salty. I've never eaten anything saltier than that dish! I couldn't eat too much of everything for fear of what could happen to my kidneys.   My Dad liked it, though I think he was just being polite. H called it 'Poor Man's Sinigang,' as tuyo is regular fare among the lower-class here in the Philippines. I think this experiment is worth another try, only this time, I won't use a tamarind-soup base, maybe a kamias or calamansi soup base for a less sour taste. I'd also fry the tuyo for more flavor, maybe even make sure the tuyo I get is not too salty -- if that's possible.   P.S. Here's a link to  urlLink the usual Sinigang Recipe ."], "gold_label": 1.0}

In the unwritten book of my life, the one that exists in some untapped ESP resource in my mind, I am lost in the plot.  I don't know if I'm half way through, if I'm a quarter read, or if I'm one page-turn away from a two letter phrase in bold:  THE END.  Who knows where we are on our own timeline.  Not I, said Mungo.  Not I, indeed.  Suppose this:  I will live a long heathy life and die at the age of 87.  A good day to die, somewhere, perhaps, in a warm field with my old wife singing the songs of our youth, rejoicing our youths and our long happy lives together.  Let's just suppose that.  And say that each week of my life was a single page in that book.  Certainly a long book.  4,524 pages...or so.  Likely printed in a leather bound, nine-volume, collector's set.  That is the most I could possible hope for.  The best end to a life I could envision is just that.  And we'll say, for the sake of the blogger (and my continued happiness in general) that it does come to that.  I would be on page 1200, or there abouts, and can look back on so many pages with so many feelings cropping up.  So many beautiful friends, so many sad times overcome, so many happy times remembered twice as strong.  And from where my book mark lies today, I can say this:  Thank you, oh my hommies, for providing so many of those good pages their vast upheavals of beatitude.  Thank you.  But now, suppose this:  I live to the age of 87 still, but instead of weekly pages, the book of my life progresses only when I do.  I advance the plot by my actions and activities only.  What page am I on now?  Maybe page 800.  Not too shabby.  And this, oh my brothers, is where I find the root of my questions.  The source from which all doubt and fear come into play.  How many more pages will I write?  Will I keep on?  Or will my book, still 63 years from completion, take only 100 pages more to complete?  Will I grow stale, enfeebled, and lax?  Or will I take hold of myself, make far-reaching advancements towards pure bliss, and life a life of expansive adventures?  Where will my personal narrative lead me?  I am faced with overt life altering decisions now, at the age of 24.  I, as you all know, am federated in the United States Air Force.  The contract binding me to service is due to expire in less than one year.  Eight months, two weeks, and six days...to be exact.  To stay in will guarantee two things:  1.  The peace of mind of stability.  I will never have to worry about remaining employed.  I will never have to worry about how I will make all those 'Next Month's'...    2.  I will delay the inevitability that one day I will have to face my number one weakness:  My unwillingness to pull free of a lackadaisical state of mind that has been with me my whole life and has (and shall continue to) agglomerate my dreadful fear of the future.  If I chose to separate myself from military service, there are no guarantees.  Not even the seemingly logical guarantee that I will face my chickenheartedness to face what is to come.  Not even that.  This is the choice I am leaning towards, and that choice fills my daily thoughts with enormous misgivings.  What will I do with myself?  What is on the next page of that book?  I have no idea.  Now, being the sole author of that book, I have found inspiration and sought advice from outside sources...and have included them heavily in the reference sections along with making those sources critical roles of my own life.  I would not be where I am without my friends and my family and the book of Erik Kershner would be a shit read without ya'll.  And it is now you that I turn to.  I cannot turn the next page without first finishing the one I am on now, so I turn to you.  I put down my pen and turn to you all for advice, encouragement, and maybe the right word combinations to put my mind back on track.  Because right now, my mind is not on the right track.  It is 1:25 ahoy   I got off the couch at 1 ahoy because I could not sleep.  I have been lying awake with ruminations and dreams of winning the fucking lottery.  It's up to 32 million dollars here in Florida.  I cannot stop giving attention to this head trip.  Of course, it's natural of me to be in this state.  I'm in a position where my worst fears are on the horizon...and winning the jackpot would be an instant and easy way around this hideous confrontation.  Hokay, I'm done.

His first letter is to Sankarsan Prabhu, a dear Godbrother of mine based in Austin, Texas.  December 1, 2003  Dear Sankarsan das,  I am trying to locate a devotee who taught me a great deal many years ago. He headed up the Temple of Understanding in Durban, South Africa, in 1987. His name was Indradyumna Swami.  He then went on a trip up the Amazon, and since then I have lost track of him. I would really love to talk to him again. He inspired my life at the time and started me on the road to higher consciousness.  I should be most happy if you could help me with this or steer me toward someone who could help me locate him.  Hare Krsna, Lance Ackerman                          ******************  December 3, 2003  Dear Lance,  Please accept my blessings.  Here's a hot link that you can use to e-mail Indradyumna Swami.  indradyumna.swami@pamho.net  Hoping this meets you in good health,  Always your well-wisher, Sankarsan das                          *******************  December 8, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  I am not sure if you remember me.  I first met devotees in Durban, South Africa, back in 1988. I was lucky enough to stay at the Temple of Understanding and even sat in meditation with you. The year after this I had to undergo national conscription in our defense force. I turned to the temple yet again and went through this as a religious objector, never carrying a firearm and somehow managing to stay vegetarian through out the whole two-year ordeal. I cannot begin to tell you how much the devotees helped me - collecting me on Sundays and taking me to Misty Hills [the Krsna Farm outside of Johannesburg], and then stuffing me full of prasad and sending me back with enough for the week, as well as some to give to all the others in my camp, many of whom had never heard of Krsna.  Whenever I complained about how terrible my situation was in this 'war environment' I found myself trapped in, you would laugh and tell me Krsna was placing all these obstacles in my way to make me see that the only way forward in this age of illusion was Krsna Consciousness. You would say the sooner I resigned myself to the truth, the better for me.  When you heard that I spent a lot of time in the bushvelt and had no Bhagavad Gita to read, you gave me a small copy. This fit in the ammo side-pockets of my pants and meant I always had access to the word of Krsna.  When I look back and realize how many blessings Krsna was bestowing on me at the tender age of 19, I now realize you were correct: there was only one real choice for me. Unfortunately, hindsight is always better and not a privilege you have when you most need it.  Unfortunately, I eventually fell back into my material ways and now find myself, at age 35, lost in maya and understanding less than I did when I was 19.  In 1994 I was diagnosed with a disease called cardiomyopathy and am now bedridden and battling for each breath I take. I often thought of contacting you and asking you for guidance, but never have until now.  Recently, when my heart dropped to a working rate of just 17%, the doctors installed a pacemaker. For a while it seemed like the miracle I had been waiting for. However, this was short-lived, and I developed something called atrial fibrillation. The result was that I eventually had to go to the hospital to have my heart shocked back into rhythm.  It was at this point that something happened which told me I had to contact you for guidance. In the hospital my neck beads, which I had been wearing since you placed them around my neck, fell off and left me in fear of demonic powers. It felt like Krsna was deserting me, or perhaps it was me that deserted him?  Now I find myself in a state of depression, wondering about suicide. But my belief in karma will not allow me to do that either.  Please help me. I do not know who else to turn to.  Hare Krsna, Lance Ackerman                          *******************  December 10, 2003  Dear Lance,  Please accept my blessings. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.  Thank you so much for your letter, which brought both joy and sadness to my heart. Joy that you have contacted me after so many years (I do remember you!), and sadness to learn of your severe illness.  I would like to help you, as I can understand that you may be nearing the last stage of your life. Of course, life is eternal, and if we are devotees of Krsna we are simply evolving slowly towards our service in the spiritual sky.  The Lord may be giving you notice of your imminent departure, and like Maharaja Pariksit (who knew he had only seven days to live), you should become very, very serious now about hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. There are specific duties we have at every stage of life, and the duty of one approaching the final stage is to completely absorb himself in sravanam-kirtanam, hearing and chanting about God.  Should you survive your present ordeal by the grace of the Lord, there will be no loss in such hearing and chanting. It is always auspicious! But if you are to leave your body in the near future, such hearing and chanting is the best way to prepare yourself for death.  A devotee can make a lot of advancement at the last stage of life. I have seen it many times. It is sort of like a sprinter who on the last lap sometimes gets a second wind, which propels him ahead to win the race.  So begin making an extra-special effort to advance towards life's ultimate goal, love for Krsna. Leave behind all other considerations. Just focus on what you know is right and is in your best interest: Krsna consciousness. You are in the most favorable circumstances for doing just that. The Lord knows best what we all need to make progress in Krsna consciousness. So there is never anything to lament.  I am coming to South Africa in January. I will be there until February 28. I would love to come and visit you, wherever you are. We can talk more deeply then.  But know for sure that I'm with you all the way. Somehow you have remembered me after all these years. You can count on me to help you in your present situation.  I look forward to hearing from you again . . . and seeing you soon.  Your servant always, Indradyumna Swami                          *******************  December 18, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I would like nothing more than to see you.  I have never forgotten you, because you had such a lasting impact on my life. I knew what you would tell me, so there were no surprises, but to think that I may have your association again leaves me ecstatic!  I am going to immerse myself in hearing and chanting, something which I have long since stopped doing.  I will tell you, it is not the thought of death that scares me, because I understand and realize it is just another step along my spiritual path. What does concern me is the way in which I will die. It is a very painful process indeed. It also makes your arrival seem a very long time away.  I also worry about the effect of my death on those around me - my family, who have been my strength during this period of my life. They are not devotees, or even remotely close to devotees, so I will need to talk to them and explain Krsna consciousness so that they can understand.  I live quite close to the airport and would gladly send someone to collect you. I am afraid I will not be in a position to come to get you personally at this stage. But I long to speak with you!  Just hearing from you has filled my heart with joy and lifted me a great deal. I am going to work very hard to survive until you come.  I am at a loss as to what else to say, so I will just say goodbye and go find my beads and begin chanting.  Hare Krsna, Lance                          *******************  December 24, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  I am Lance Ackerman's sister. Lance died yesterday after a long debilitating illness. He spoke to me about your forthcoming trip to South Africa, which he was very excited about. He was determined to stay well long enough to meet with you. He was overjoyed to hear from you.  Lance and I have shared a home for many years. I had watched him getting weaker and more reliant on his family over the past few years. Since May of this year he had been permanently bedridden. Throughout all this he lived fearlessly, with love, joy, compassion, and intelligence, even at the worst times.  Recently, however, he became fearful, filled with anxiety and anger. When your email arrived he was about to go back into the hospital. Except for twenty-minute catnaps, he had not slept for weeks. He was despondent, in constant pain and discomfort. But after your letter arrived he slept peacefully for the first time in weeks. He made a remarkable recovery and did not have to go to the hospital. He was no longer fearful or anxious. He was relaxed and said he felt at peace.  He said that for years he had lost touch with his beliefs, but felt he was now on the right track again. He was happy and serene. Your letter gave him great comfort.  I am heartbroken that my little brother has gone. I will miss him terribly. I wanted him to hang on at any price. But I am also grateful that he found an inner peace before he died and that he was able to let go when he was ready, without fear. I thank you for that.  You had a great impact on his life. He tried to describe why he felt so joyful to hear from you, and what sticks in my mind is what he described as your passing on to him a special grace - a grace that touched him at the very end.  With thanks, Gail Ackerman                         *******************   January 31, 2003  Dear Gail,  It was with great sadness that I received your letter.  I was so much looking forward to meeting Lance again after many years. As you said, he wrote to me only a few weeks ago, asking for help in the difficult times he was going through. I am content that I was able to give him solace in the last moments of this life.  His spiritual quest grew more and more important to him in his last days. I suppose this is natural for all of us. That he died peacefully is a sign that he achieved a level of spiritual understanding and satisfaction for which all of us can be proud of him.  Like you, I will miss him. But I am sure that Lance's higher goals have taken him to a place more beautiful than the one we live in now.  Thank you for taking the time to write to me. I appreciate it very much.

It's been nearly a month since I last posted to this thing. I'd love to tell you that I had a family member die, or I decided to go to truck driving school, or I found the love of my life - only to find out she was inflatable, but I can't. I didn't post because I am a lazy son of a bitch - simple as that. I've been playing a lot of the sims (I did kill off a few family members in the sims, but only to make tombstones). I almost bought Jupiter, but the guy got arrested for stealing a goat before I could sign the papers. Of course, you would think that I would have lots to say after being gone for almost a month - and you'd be thinking wrong. The problem is that I post when the thought strikes me, and I post what's on my mind right then, so it doesn't really build up. I do, however, collect odd links. Here are some for your browsing pleasure:  urlLink Screw Radio Shack!  Use tortillas to make your circuits.  urlLink NerdPerfect  Like Slashdot, only different.  urlLink You can't just fuck the fish  - You gots to make looooooove to the fish. (Ok, I know dolphins aren't fish, but I don't care - it's sounds better this way.) By the way, that last link mentions that male dolphins have a 10-14' long prehensile penis, meaning they can pick stuff up with it. And when they orgasm, They can shoot love gravy 14 feet. Lucky bastards.\n\nText 2:I have a tendency to say 'there's always time.'  I don't regret that - it is true.  However, that is a bit of a problem.  There is always time....which means so much time to squander.  I have not written the last couple days, in the hopes of getting a draft of a dissertation chapter done.  Sadly, that did not happen.  It is too easy to blow time away.  Certainly, sloth is an old associate of mine.  Kind of like that slob roommate who never leaves the apartment, even when you are entertaining a guest of the opposite sex.  The type of slob who slowly grows organically linked to some piece of furniture in your apartment.  This is the sloth that follows me.  That haunts me.  That taunts me.  It would no doubt insult me too, but that would require too much effort.  So, I spend the evening here in my office, trying to work, and getting blessed little done.  It is the great all-nighter.  Now, I originally didn't have a lot of experience with this - it was generally unnecessary in undergrad.  My all-nighters usually involved laying in bed, feeling that ninth vodka shot penetrating my stomach, as a quietly say to the ceiling 'kill me.....kill me.....kill me.....'  But, once I came to grad school, tha tall-nighter and I became fast allies.  But, I can tell I'm getting old.  I remember my military history prof at UD telling us that a good commander must be able to be functional for 72 hours straight.  In my all-nighters, I decided to take that challenge.  If it works for the army, heck, it's got to work for academia.  Alas, I think my record was only at a wimpy 50 hours or so (angst).  That's when the walls started moving, and I thought I could surf on the floor (as a warning, rug burns on one's feet, though rare, make up for infrequency with sheer unmitigated pain).  Now, now I can barely make 24 hours.  What happened?  It hasn't been that long!  Surely the difference of 22 to 26 can't be that drastic!  What next?  A cane?  Dentures?  Viagra?  The mind shudders....  The point of all this?  Well, there isn't one, really.  That's the problem - the first thing to go is the ability to be decisive and be conclusive.  I think.  Perhaps.  Well, I'm not sure....  But a vicious cycle ensues.  Yes, you know the all-nighter won't help.  But, you'll be awake all night thinking of all you're not doing.  So, you have the choice of laying down and doing nothing, or sitting in your office and doing nothing.  Well, except perhaps for screwing around on the internet.  Guess option two will win out any day.  I think.  Perhaps.  Well, I'm not really sure...."], "gold_label": 0.0}

She has to gather  in a month  all her documentation for the past two years regarding her expenses.  Who the hell  keeps  all their documentation for the past two years (let alone the past two months)?  I mean, sure I might have some gas and hydro bills lying around, but I share that stuff with my roomates.  What do  they  do if they need those documents and I'm the only one who has copies?  I don't handle the phone bill, my roomate Karen does.  I don't have any records of how much money I've spent on the phone bill for the past two years.  Am I supposed to photocopy each and every bill and file it and save it in a box with a pile of other useless paper?  Makes you wonder why the rainforests are dying.  In Alisha's case, she lived at a house that has since sold, and the owner is nowhere to be found so he can't be contacted to verify Alisha's testimony.  What the fuck are you supposed to do in  that  situation?  I understand that the government is hurting for money (aren't we all?) and it can't afford for people to be fraudulently reporting their taxes and whatever.  But Alisha and all the rest of my friends are just students out of school with less than no money.  Even if we were stealing from the government we'd still have nothing.  What do they expect us to do?  Alisha's going to have to pay additional taxes because she can't prove where she lived for the last year (cuz the guy's gone).  She didn't live  nowhere .  Her rent wasn't  zero .  And it probably wasn't even that much either.  It just seems like they're trying to draw blood from a stone (and not even a stone... I mean it's just nothing... us students  have NOTHING !)  So Alisha is in the middle of trying to find a job to pay her piling bills, the bank is breathing down her neck because she can't pay her loans, and now the government decided to audit her.  What the hell man?  If no one will hire you and you got no money, what are you supposed to do?  Let me analyze this situation from a more abstract perspective.  What the fuck does the government actually  do  for us in the first place anyway?   1.  Protection from invading barbarians  Isn't this over and done with already?  Who the hell really cares enough to mount an army, cross the ocean, and invade another country?  What would the point be?  Ok, there's terrorists, and third world nations who want our food or whatever, but man.  Those are just the people in the world that share the Earth with us too.  If they want to move in, shouldn't they be allowed?   2. Law and Order  Arguments might be thrown around like over population and destruction of the environment and lack of food and violence.  But why do these things happen in the first place?  Do we really need laws to  tell  people what to do?  We're intelligent creatures.  We can think for ourselves.  Maybe the problem is just that people don't understand fully what the situation is.  Maybe it's  education  that is needed, not some far off 'leader' yelling down from his palace telling us how we should be living our lives.   3. Health Care  I care for my friends, and I care that I live amongst a group of people who live lives similar to my own.  I think we got an ok thing going for the most part and I'd want to help keep it going, you know?  If I had a knowledge of medicine and stuff, I'd share that with y'all to help you when you got sick.  But I'm no doctor.  Instead, I'm an  urlLink artist , and I share beauty with everyone to care for aesthetic minds (that's just what I happen to be good at).  If the government wasn't pulling the strings, I think we'd still help each other out.  We might not get  paid  but maybe we'd feel good at the end of a day of helping out.  Things wouldn't become complete chaos either.  We're smart and would organize into structures (e.g., hospitals) that would help us on our journeys through Being.   4. Roads and Transportation, Etc.  If you want to go somewhere, you'll find a way of getting there.  If it means building a road, I'm sure you could find a group of other people who need a road too and you could band together to make that road.    . . .  Ok, maybe I'm taking things too far to an anarchist extreme.  The point is, I think our society is too stuck up in its hierarchical structures which are deemed  a priori  'right.'  Guess what government!  There  is  no right and wrong!  That's just something we made up so only the 'good,' white, Christians could go to heaven.    We've each of us got enough problems on our plates to handle.  We don't need abstract hierarchies imposing additional strain on our lives.  Life on its own is fucked up as it is (what the hell  is  humanity and what is it doing here?)  Can't we just be left alone to figure shit out?  I didn't  choose  to be born into this society.  I didn't choose the laws that govern me (as much as they'd like to make me believe that I live in a democracy, what say have I really had in its operation and development?).  I don't agree with the goals of the larger group, or even that 'larger group' is a meaningful category.  I've never met someone from British Columbia; how could I be expected to understand the needs and desires of B.C. Dasein?  I can't.  That's my point.  Neither can Ottawa understand mine.

I'm feeling the best I have in years, but the coming weeks/months are going to be the deciding factor on all the decisions I make for the rest of my life. Like I said, right now I feel like the happiest and luckiest guy on the planet...even on a Monday! I just read Yoshi's blog and took a quick glance at  urlLink The Rapture  (iTunes link) and I think I'm going to have to delve a little more into their music. The little that I've listened to reminds me of Radiohead meets The Cure meets Underworld. Good call, Yoshi. As a quick sum-up of everything that has been going on with me, Matrix Revolutions sucks. I would have happily paid half price to skip the whole first half of the film ( damn it, no more talking heads!!! This isn't a fucking Oscar winning drama!). Effects were pretty cool, though. I didn't like having to think during the movie. This should not be a thinking movie, it should be a fun popcorn film with any sort of underlaying meanings bubbled up to the laymen by the end of the film. I prefer to leave my thinking cap on to those who know how to make a good movie (see:  urlLink David Lynch ) Work has been a little hectic, but I've been able to work on a pretty cool little windows application for the last few weeks, which has greatly increased my proficiency at programming windows apps. I got to see Steph for the second time in less than a month (Yeah!!!!!) and two days later have an enourmously heart-breaking urge to see her again as soon as possible. I've gotten all unneccessisary bills cut down to their bare minimum and am now fully focued on killing my credit card debt once and for all(thanks, Steph!). My foosball team beat the first place team in our league (damn it, we're still in third place, though). My fridge is now full of leftovers that I will probably never get around to eating so they'll just go bad. I haven't went out for lunch in over three weeks. My cat's getting fatter. I only have Fox News now, so I'm going to be turning into a hardcore conservative in a matter of weeks. I still have the  urlLink new Dido CD  (sorry, iTunes again) in my car stereo. I have managed to bring my only plant back from the dead for the fifth time. Sean's still grumpy. And I finally got around to chopping my hair.\n\nText 2:new comments on the journal.

I gave up being mean and vengeful, it just took way too much energy.  My classes are almost two hrs. long and back to back, it takes all day and breakfast is bright and early and lunch is only served if you get there on time, or you have to wait for the next course.  I have had to stay up late and study every night after exhausting days.  This is not an easy way to do it.  It is taking so much more effort than even school at home.  I was supposed to have read 75 pgs last night for just Debtor Creditor alone, then I had Immigration too.  I don\u00b4t have time to do anything and I am so worn by midday that I have to resist naps by not allowing myself in the physical bldg of the hotel, or then I nap and don\u00b4t sleep at night.  I actually haven\u00b4t slept for two nights now, except about 4 hrs last night, which for me is not enough.  I am sorry I can\u00b4t  email you all individually, I was under the very mistaken belief that this program would be a bit less strenuous, they say that it is, but they lie, it like the reading assignments that never end.  I look like hell, don\u00b4t have time for makeup and have let my hair go curly.  I am so damn tired.  Yesterday 15 girls and I decided to mastermind a jaunt into Madrid, very stupid choice on my part, it took into the wee hours of the morning to make up for time lost in Madrid.  This is also hard.  Apparently St. Mary\u00b4s is stupid and wrong, this isn\u00b4t a Bankruptcy course, this opens with Debtor-Creditor relations (a course I hadn\u00b4t heard of at St. MU), then we move onto Bankruptcy, then Secured Transactions, then wrap-up with Spanish/civil law.  To all the non law-junkies, thats a three hour course, followed by a three hour course, topped off with a three hour course, and a full other round of law school in the civil tradition.  WHAT AM I DOING?  I am buying sleeping pills today.  Mom can you fill my prescription ones and have daddy fedex them to me?  I need to sleep.  I have to dink caf\u00e9 con leche constantly and still can\u00b4t function.  This sucks.  I hate law school.  Oh and the kicker is that the Dean keeps asking me to climb this literal mountain behind us, a 5 mile climb, how can I say no?  He is really excited and thinks I want to go, I want to get my reading done and figure out what Bankruptcy is?  I have to figure out how community property in Texa sfigured into a case where the Husband owed IRS taxes and wife didn\u00b4t get to claim her vested interest in her half of his money, something about the govt having priority, but even though the case said she wasn\u00b4t liable, only her husband was, that they could still get at half of her money through community property  because of his vested interest in her property.  Seems like a double edged sword, she has a half interest in  his income and is not at fault, but can\u00b4t protect her share, while he is the wrongdoer and his the only one liable, gets to pay off his debt by also accessing part of her half vested interest in his income.  What in the hell did I just say?  Did I mention I didn\u00b4t like property law?\n\nText 2:April just emailed me, here's an excerpt...

I don't understand you and your freaky deeky Dutch.  Dammit.  2.  Ok.  I'm from Wisconsin.  Lived here my whole life.  In four days, I'm moving to Minnesota permentantly.  My wonderful Chad is there.  Wonderful jobs are there.  Living there means the wedding is going to be there.  We will be living there and it will be a hell of a lot easier to plan the wedding.  This was an issue, but doesn't seem to be one as much anymore.  They could return to it.  Who knows.  My mom did say that none of my father's family was going to come.  Bullshit.  They all went to my cousin's wedding in Hudson, WI.. a whole 45 minutes away from the Twin Cities area where we live.  I've talked to them.  They're coming.    3.  The church issue.  This one probably won't be settled until some time after the wedding and maybe not even then.  Fuck 'em.  My family is very Catholic.  I'm not.  Chad's not.  Our wedding.  See where I am going with this?  Monday, as my grandmother is bringing me back to my mom's, we drive past the new St. Matt's church.  She was going on and on and on about how beautiful it is.  She's saying this to someone who has seen the Catherdrals at Strasbourg, Reims, Chartres and Notre Dame in Paris.  I highly doubt this modern church meets my views of beautiful.  So I just shrugged at her comment.  I haven't seen the new church because I don't go to church.  So she says, in response to my shrug 'Why are you so anti-church?'  I tell her it's my opinion.  She tells me 'If you were with someone who went to church, I bet you would go too.'  Excuse me?  What the fuck did you just say?  Lucky for her she was driving and I don't particularly like to hit drivers.  One more comment like that about Chad and I swear... grrrrrrrrr.  4.  Later on monday, my brother, Josh, informs me that my uncle is going to lecture me when he gets up here for my graduation.  He can lecture me all the fuck he wants about supposedly getting married too early and wanting to have a family too early.  This is coming from a man who has never married and does not have kids.  If he thinks for one moment that I am just going to sit there and take his shit, he has another thing coming.  That side of the family has to learn to stop fucking with me and learn to let me grow up.  I'm 22 and they treat me like I'm 12 and don't know what I'm doing..ever.  People who never got beyond high school telling a soon to be college grad that she's dumb.  Lovely.     There... done for now.  Feel free to  urlLink email me ."], "gold_label": 0.0}

There are 7 regular 'no license' channles and the other 15 channels are the 5 milers. I wonder if I will be arrested for using the long range ones with no license? Hmm.....

For instance, today, I ate some asian thing called '...' I don't know the name anymore, it's like some sticky rice wrapped in some green asian leaf.  It has a little bit of meat inside and it's steamed.  I really don't care anymore.  My mom made it, and it tasted good.  Other days, I don't eat, and starve a little.  Most days I sit around my house playing Counter-Strike or Warcraft 3.  Usually on the Gameline.ca servers.  Somedays I go out, and eat lunch with friends.  Like today I went to Sonny's.  Or play poker with friends.  For the past 3 weeks, a lot of poker has occured.  Almost everyday.  After that, I drive my mom to work exactly at 3.  Soon after, I go back to either poker or video games.  Sometimes I go to Body Works.  After that I go to Aaron's most of the time, and do something, in most cases, it involves poker.  If I'm not at home around 6, my dad will surely call me on my cell phone.  I short conversation will occur, usually with me telling him that I'll be home later.  He'll say 'okay.' or mumble something in agreeance and hang up.  Then I would continue with whatever.  With that, I usually don't come home until much later, as I either go out to eat, or play some card game/gamble/video game/or some other activity.  At 11:45, I usually leave whatever I'm doing, and go pick up my mom from work.  Then head home. On the drive home, I usually get some lecture from my mom about whatever... and usually this ends up with me arguing with her.  For instance, yesterday, she basically said I don't know what I'm getting into by going to Woodbine, I promptly said 'Shut the fuck up.  You don't know shit.'  She then shut up, and we argued some more afterwards.  Today we argued about how I'm so forgetful, and that it's entirely my fault for not being organized enough to quickly find things when in need of them.  This somehow started, from when I asked her 'Do you know where that green hub is?' She then got into a lecture, we then argued, and then I told her to fuck off at some point.  I think on Tuesday we argued about my driving skills.  I really don't like backseat driving.  She constantly tells me I'm driving too fast.  After the 2nd warning of me telling her to stop talking about my driving.  I told her, to shut the fuck up, or get out of the car.    As you can see, me and my mom have a working relationship.  She lectures, I tell her to fuck off and we rinse and repeat every single day.  You might think, I use lighter words, or maybe talk to my mom in a more proper tone.  I don't, not recently anyway, not for the past 6 months.  She told me today that I was stressed, that I curse way more than I use to, and that it's unhealthy.  I wonder why mom.  I wonder fucking why.  I could tell her.  I could tell her what's bothering me.  It would probably crush her heart and smash it much like a broken mirror.  I really can't live in this house much longer.  I'm glad I'm getting away.  I'm glad."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Ah, the humanity.\n\nText 2:Two things occurred to me tonight.  One, it had to be a man who invented pantyhose.  (I was right.  His name was Allen Gant Senior.  Pantyhose were first introduced here in North 'first in flight, first in pantyhose' Carolina in 1959.)  Second, I ought to make a pantyhose aerobics video.  For Christmas sake, they're like torture.  Of course, being the abundantly blessed woman I am, all my pantyhose are the industrial strength high-tensile radial belted steel control top kind, which makes it even more of a workout.  Seriously, you can break a sweat putting these things on.  Then, at the very last moment, when you think you're finally there, zing! You get a run that looks like the CSX Atlantic Coast Line track running from thigh to ankle.  And so you begin again.  But the fun doesn't end with just getting them on, oh no.  Then you have to actually move about the place and so on.  And they creep.  Have you never heard of pantyhouse creep?  It's a serious issue.  There you are, going about your business without any problem, when suddenly the crotch of the pantyhose is strangling your knees.  Naturally, this only occurs when you are at least 50 yards from the nearest closet/bathroom/office/stairwell/whatever where you can hide and adjust them.  But wait!  There's more.  The last and possibly the most serious issue of wearing pantyhose is the dreaded center seam.  Now, if you don't get those pantyhose JUST RIGHT, or if they creep, that seam is going to create more friction than LA needs to create a day's worth of electricity.  The government's studying this as we speak-whether chubby women in pantyhose can somehow be rigged to a treadmill and the resultant seam chafe friction used to power steam turbines to create a cheap and renewable source of electricity.  Richard Simmons is thrilled-if it's approved, he's got plans for a series of powerplants around the country marketed as women's gyms, with rows of treadmills all rigged to capacitors, and big generator substations out back.  L'eggs is in on it too, with free pantyhose to all members for the life of their membership.  It's potentially enormous.  Bush is pushing it in Congress, hoping he can shut out the Middle East as an international power by eliminating our dependence on imported oil.  You heard it here first.  So all that remains now is for me to get a hold of Peter 'Lord of the Rings' Jackson and have him direct my 'Pantyhose For Pounds' exercise video.  Brilliant.

From missing my hubby, to feeling like someone beat me with a big stick!  Spent most of the day yesterday outdoors on a sunny yet chilly spring day.  When the studio construction was completed, they were supposed to clean up the yard and put the patio back as a 'courtesy', but since it wasn't 'in the contract' that courtesy was not extended in any form other than a verbal 'let's close the deal' pitch.  Ah well, more work for me, lesson learned.  My father in law, bless his poor achey back, brought his rototiller and helped break up the ground and concrete blobs left behind.  We got about half of the patio done before we were both too sore to continue.  Today, ow.  Walked half a mile on the treadmill, if that.  I walked and moved with extreme caution today!  I also miss my man.  I've not heard from him since Tuesday, and with all the goings-on, I really would like to hear his voice.  I know it's ok that he hasn't called, no calls are better than calls from the 'other' kind of military people, so I reassure myself saying it'll either be him, or nothing.  And that's ok, but still I miss him. Today was a rough day being so sore, the first day of spring break, girls at eachother from 7 a.m. until dusk.  FUN!  The picture there is a very intricately beaded piece done by a client of mine.  Isn't it beautiful?  She had been working on it for quite some time and when I painted for her and got to know her she decided that this was meant for us.  I am such a gush, I wept when I opened it.  It is truly beautiful.  I meant to post it when I got it but kept forgetting to get a picture of it.  I finally did, because I wrote to Mark about it and included this pic in his letter so he could see it.  Anyhoo I wanted to share it because I have been thinking a lot lately about my clients who have become such wonderful friends that are so dear to me, and it means a lot to me that this sweet special bond is all created by a love for art and beautiful animals.  :)  Have a good night & great Sunday, don't forget to change your clocks!

'life will find a way,' to quote from 'jurassic park,' and it's just plain dangerous!  we honestly only *imagine* we know what we're doing when we do that.  we *don't* know the long-term effects of these g.m. organisms upon the ecosystem long-term.  nor do we know the long-term effects upon it of the various new chemicals we produce and dump everywhere.  why are we so blind and unthinking and even uncaring?  it makes no sense.  it's poisonous attitudes that are to blame, of course, things like greedy attachment, malice and (especially willful) ignorance, pride, superstition, and all those, which are called 'kleshas' in buddhism.  according to buddhism these kleshas have been with us, partially dominating us, from beginningless time.  personally i don't think it's worth blaming anyone, because it's only that we've been dominated by these bad patterns which we *wouldn't* allow ourselves to be dominated by if we were *really* aware of their effects upon our happiness and suffering levels.  we need to clear our judgments from these bad patterns if we are to overcome them, which we definitely *can* do.  some people have done it thoroughly, some people more partially, but it *can* be done and it *must* be done, by humanity en masse and generally by all sentient beings en masse throughout the universe/multiverse/all.  it's a big task, but i vow to you that it shall be done.  then we'll have a permanent golden age in real life.  i vow it to you.  nothing is ultimately more important to me than accomplishing that and then enjoying the results forever.  it's a serious vow, so hold me to it (in a reasonable fashion of course).  i've found that the best sources of information about the nature of reality which are practical for building *real* personal strict knowledge upon are theosophy, buddhism, and modern science, in terms of overcoming blindness and the kleshas in general and coming to know the reality of our situation firsthand.  some of the results are in my certain experience surprising and strange, especially how very psychological natural processes generally seem to be.  mind is heavily involved in every phenomenon which has any meaningful existence, and it can be quite surprising to have true revelations about this.  and it can be highly *useful* to come to know this stuff firsthand, i know from my own experience.  it's a universe of *living* energy/matter/sensation which is gradually learning how to make itself (all of us, that is) thoroughly happy.  our happiness (its happiness) is most definitely the one central aim of it all.  even our blunders we make imagining they'll make us happier.  because the whole thing shares a wish for perfect (implying unalloyed and permanent) happiness, and because it's developing better and better intelligence, and because some beings have already achieved their individual perfections, there's real hope for us all in the long run, very real actual hope for us all to be quite happy together forever someday in actuality.  just think about it, eh?  l8r...\n\nText 2:Hey, peeps.

I've been saying for ages that its not that big of a deal.  I'll put in some excerpts from what I wrote the other day: {I can't put all, because then you might actually begin to understand, and we can't have that, can we?} I want, so very badly, to go away, to be gone, to hold my breath and disappear into nothingness, and for my existance to be forgotten.  Therefore, it wouldn't matter any more, nothing would.  You would have never known me, and been all the better for it.  This sickening knot would melt into serenity and would be no more.   Marbles roll across the floor to disappear between cracks in the floorboards, and pictures flicker across the movie screen which is the landscape of my mind.  Images which possibly never were, figments {a fig is a fruit, a fruit that was meant to be?} of my imagination.  Do I miss the fruit? I miss what used to be my reality, perhaps not a real reality, but mine all the same.  I've come to hate the sound of my name on people's lips.  It's inconsistancy tires me.... I also think  If I really were perfect, then everything would be ok.  Then I would know all the answers. This is merely my response... yet another piece of fruit.  I think of Margaret Atwood, and her heroine who drove off the side of a bridge in her sister's car, and with yet another piece of fruit {perhaps this time it is a pear}  I think of the girl's hands, gloves cuffed with lace, clutching the steering wheel. and I look up and see the lacey iron works of the side of the bridge... but my car is my own, and I have no gloves.  ...On the palm of my hand there's a disaster.  I must have been born with it.  I carry it with me wherever I go.  When he touched me, the bad luck came off on him.  I am awake now. I think of the questions they've asked. Are you happy Rachel?  I think  please, please don't say my name. and I say yes of course I am.  Things are going very well for me.  I smile. Is everything ok Rachel?   not my name.  my name. Everything's fine, why do you ask? Are you sure?  I feel the pressure, bugging out my eyeballs.  I blink.  Yes of course.  and I am craving a fig newton.    and I think I've already said too much, but I need someone to save me.  I need a piece of sanity. but it never seems to be enough. and its never the right person. there always seems to be more instead of less. and I am not thankful for this bountiful harvest. I feel as if I should be crying tears of something other than mere salty water, these tears should tears of lead, though their release doesn't lighten my load at all,  and I keep them to myself. You don't need to know this nor do I. There are things I wish I had never known things I wish I could forget. things I wish would cease their constant flashing across my mind. and I have nothing left to do there was never anything I could do.

It was called the aeananasumthingram...i don't even remember what it was called.  Anyway, it told me I was extroverted, decisive, and organized.  So I tried again.  I only changed like three answers but all of a sudden I was not so extroverted and not necessarily organized.  So then I used that information to search for the livejournals and blogs of people like me.  Apparently people like me are depressed and alcoholic.  Interesting I think, since I suffer from neither depression or alcoholism :).  Today all I did was work, help out with tennis camp, and volunteer at the horse place.  It was a very busy and full day, if only routine.  I had fun at the equestrian center.  I was talking to Aimee (girl from Summit that volunteers there) and she was telling me how next week she is gonna go on like a four day long trip with the newspaper staff cuz she will be a staff writer next year and so of course, Ryan is going.  And I was just thinking about how if it weren't for tams, i'd be going to that thing....*sigh* oh well :).  TAMS is like a two-year-long camp, right?  :) :).  Work was soooooo boring.  I just wanted to come home the whole time.  Tomorrow is payday.  Yay.  So today I was thinking about why do I think the things I think?  Like when I eat homemade blue bell vanilla ice cream, why does my brain tell my tongue that it is deliciously creamy and...delicious?  And why does my brain tell my tongue that whipped cream is the devil when in reality it is not that far from vanilla ice cream?  And whoever decided that pain was a bad thing?  Pain is merely what your brain tells your nerves to feel, so why does your brain think it has to be bad?  Why are our perceptions on these matters the way that they are?  Why does it bother me when the two stacks of hand held baskets at work are uneven?  Why does it bother me when one bag is fuller than the other?  Do I think that the emptier bag is more lonely?  In the end, I end up using the same amount of bags anyway, so why does it matter to me so much that the bags have equal amounts of groceries in them???  Or like when you hurt one leg, you feel that the other leg is jealous of the other leg so you have to hurt your other leg too so that they are equal.  And it REALLY bothers me that my eyes have different seeing abilities.  One is at like -5 and one is like at a -4.5 (this is contact prescription talk here if you don't understand it).  WHY ARE MY EYES UNEVEN???  IS MY LEFT EYE JEALOUS OF MY RIGHT EYE?  DOES IT SIT IN THE DARK AT NIGHT PONDERING SUICIDE BECAUSE MY RIGHT EYE WAS BORN WITH BETTER VISION??????  Why the hell should an eye have to live with a burden like that?  Now, I feel sorry for my left eye.  And it sucks for my left eye more than it does the emptier bag of groceries because I can even out the grocery bags but I can't do diddly squat for my left eye.  Except for maybe stab my right eye out with a stick.  But that would make my right eye worse than my left eye so I would feel sorry for it.  AND it would cause pain, which my brain perceives to be bad, much to my dismay and bewilderment.  You know what, I do not understand relationships.  Say in a hypothetical situation you have an awesome relationship with a guy at school, just a friend or whatnot but you can have awesome conversations with him.  Deep, philosophical, but also funny and easygoing.  Then summer comes and you do not talk to this guy for like a month.  Then, when you finally talk to him again it is like the magic is gone.  You just don't get along with him like you used to.  And this saddens you. Why did the relationship go sour?  Can a month really change people that much?  Well, I guess just look at me and how I have changed so much this past six or so months.  A year ago, I was a completely different person.  I rather prefer the person I am now.  Much more open-minded I am.  Change is an interesting thing.  We dread it, and yet, without it, life would be terribly dull.  I mean, I love summer and wish it would last forever, but if summer lasted forever it would lose its appeal, its ability to seem magical and free.  Infinite....  Ever since I brought up that word with Fifer I have been thinking about it a lot, what it means to be infinite.  It is the feeling you get listening to an acoustic guitar while driving into the sunset....it is sitting in a group of your favorite friends talking under the stars...it is laying down in the middle of a field and looking up at the sky for an hour...its hanging out with people and listening to music...its laughing while completely forgetting that a grim reality awaits you when the laughter is over.  It's everything that the good stuff in life is made out of.  That is what feeling infinite really means.  Our childhood is infinite....our teenagerhood is infinite.  While we may grow older and die, it will never fade away.  It will live in our minds as the best years of our lives.  And that is what it truly is.    It is time for bed now.  I downloaded much good music today.  I am only to the fs though.  Tomorrow I will get further.   Goodnight, goodnight.  Sleep well and when you dream, dream of me. (West Side Story)  -Lisa\n\nText 2:Current Mood: Tired Current Music: None  Uggh. I hardly got any sleep last night. The twin terrors stole my room for the night and I was forced to sleep downstairs on the floor. At least it was better than the couch... Sorry I was cut off last time. My mum literally threw me off the computer. Uggh. I spent the rest of the afternoon teaching the oldest of the terrors how to play Harry Potter and the philosiphers stone (My mum bought me it like 3 years ago). It didn't install properly or something so everything was in slow motion and there was a three minute gap between characters saying their sentences. Very tedious. It's so warm outside! My computer is in my conservatory and when the sun shines on it it acts like a mini oven. The good thing about it is that it kills all the flies that have decided to infest my home. Yay? What else can I talk about? (I seem to ask that question a lot these days.... I have a very boring life). I finally got to see my LotR DVD, but my mum and my brother were arguing all the way through it so it wasn't that fun... :-( I'm gonna watch all the special features later on today though. That's right folks. I am that sad. There's something new that I want to bitch about now (I've just seem it in Warriors Realm). What is with 'teh'? Danny keeps going on at my because he thinks that it's a mistake. But how can soooooo many people make mistakes on the same bloody word!!! Is it supposed to be 't'? Like they say in some places in England? 'Open t door Judy..' And if it isn't then why do they use it? It isn't shorter, it doesn't take less time! AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGG!!!!!! I also hate the replacing words with numbers. But more about that next time. See ya!!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Wei Wei Cui.  From the ERIC Digest:  Surveys allow information to be collected from a sample group and generalized to the population at large. Because they are low cost and easy to implement, mail surveys are used more frequently for social research than either telephone or face-to-face interviews. Those conducting surveys should recognize four potential sources of error -- sampling error, non-coverage error, non-response error, and measurement error -- and take steps to minimize their impact. Any one of these sources of error may make the survey results unacceptable (Groves, 1989; Salant and Dillman, 1994; Dillman, 1991, 1999). This article describes the four types of errors and summarizes ways they can be reduced.    Sampling Error   Mail surveys, like all surveys, collect information only from the people who are included in the sample. Because certain members of the population are deliberately excluded through selection of the sample, their responses are not obtained. Conclusions about the population at large are thus drawn from sample survey results. The heterogeneity of the survey measures among members of the population (in other words, the degree to which it does not represent the general population) will cause the so-called sampling error.\n\nText 2:urlLink George W.

Flying to Czech Republic and back home to Houston would cost me 1,185 dollars and once I got to Prague it would cost me 300 Euro to rent a car for the five days I would spend there.  I choose my attractions by interest To travel to Prague, Czech Republic from Houston it cost me 1,183 dollars. Once I got here I spent 314 Euro to rent a compact car for five days. I spent Ten dollars and seventy-five cents on a reference dictionary for translating their language. For attractions I spent all together sixteen and five Euro (I don\u2019t know how to read their money). My hotel with free breakfast (probably paid for in price for hotel) cost me 300 euro. The total cost for my meals was 172.5 Euro. I spent 175 dollars on souvenirs for my dad, mother, Granny Iva, Nana, Doggy Oggy, Erica, and Me! Plus an extra fifteen dollars a day turns up to be seventy-five. If you leave the Euros, Euros and turned the dollars into Euros then I would have spent 2900.68 Euros. Turn that into dollars and its 3563.49 dollars which means I have 2436.51 dollars left. I have enough money to replace my computer, or maybe ill get a digital paint set.     4/25/04 Today I packed my things to leave for a five day trip to Czech Republic. In my suitcase you will find. A lot of warm clothes. Jeans, long sleeve shirts, tons of socks, underclothing, tennis shoes, Tylenol, tooth paste and brush, hair brush, shampoo, deodorant, and my fuzzy blanket. I started packing early so I could make it to the airport on time. My friend, Erica, and my dad drove me to Houston. We made it there just in time for me to put on my luggage and get on the plane at 5:40 p.m. they served us supper and I slept a good was their as well as read. The flight landed at 10:25 a.m. and I got my luggage and went and picked up my car which I could have gotten at 9 a.m. if I had been there. I put my stuff into my compact car and drove to my hotel. There I checked in and went to my room. I settled in. I decided to set out for lunch and found the most pleasant restraunt. I went back to the hotel and rested for a little while and realized that out the widow there was the most magnificent view of the city. I took a shower and changed into some nicer clothes. Went to eat again and then went to a Black Light Theater.  I got back to the hotel room at about 10 or 10:30 and went to sleep. Overall today went quite well. I was amazed at the city and the beauty of the architecture but the Black Light Theater was not all that I had hoped.              Oh by the way, I traveled eleven hours and forty-five minuets in air not to mention after that. WOW!  4/26/04 Today I am to travel to Plzen. Its about a thirty minuet drive. I have already ate my breakfast and am about to get on the road. I should get there in time to do some shopping before lunch.  I figure ill get something for my dad, Doggy Oggy , Granny Iva, Erica, and Mother. That\u2019s about one hundred dollars. After shopping ill get lunch and then go to the Monastery. I\u2019ve heard about them and always thought it sounded neat so I am going to see one today. I amagine that I will be there a good deal of the day. Ill drive another probably thirty-five minuets(longer since its dark). I will get back to the hotel about eight thirty, took a shower and went to bed.  Did I mention that it has been raining for the past two days. Grrrrr.... Yeah. Bummer.   4/27/04 Alright. The third day here and its still poring rain(reason for tons of socks). I skipped breakfast and left the hotel early because the weather and the drive which was an hour and thirty minuets. I am going to Brno today. Here there is some kind of cemetery that for some reason is special (Honestly, I just went for the name. Brno. Its great. That is what im going to name my next dog). Any ways, ten bucks to go see a cemetery! Can you say crazy! I can, and I have a friend who can say it in thirteen different languages. Five are computer languages. It wasn\u2019t so bad thought. Its not like I\u2019ve spent tons of money anywhere else. So yeah after the Cemetery my feet were soaking wet. That\u2019s why I brought three extra pair of socks. And people call women crazy for over packing. I had an umbrella I bought after I got there so the rest of me was pretty dry. So yeah I went and ate lunch and then went shopping. I got something for my Nana. Also I remembered I had not gotten myself anything, therefor I did. I drove back to the hotel yet again, and fell to bed with no shower completely exhausted.   4/28/04 Today is the last day I will get to do anything. I wake up and cant remember anything past when I walked into the hotel lobby. I took a cold shower to get myself fully functional and went downstairs to have breakfast. Still not fully awake I go upstairs and back to bed. I wake up at noon and go out for lunch after fixing my hair. Then I make my way to The Museum of Decorative Arts.  I honestly cant say why I choose here except.........well it might have had something to do with that really hot guy in my English class who came here last year and suggested it. But really you never know. I spent hours here, until supper at least and went to eat yet again. Then I decided standing in one of the rooms there that I would go out and drive around the town if the weather cleared up( the hot guy said it was the best part). And ya know you wont believe it but I got to go. It was the nicest evening I had there and the building were beautiful. I don\u2019t know if I would go back but im certainly glad I went.  4/29/04 So today is my last day here. I eat breakfast at the hotel, pack my bags, and go to the airport. I get on the plane and sit there for thirteen hours and twenty-five minuets, plus the three hour drive home. I dread it. I mean I love to travel but this is just to much. I figured it out on the plane and I will be coming home with 2,436.51 dollars left. I could buy a computer, except I have one already. I finished reading the book that I started at the beginning of the trip.   4/30/04 Alright. So I know your saying, hey that was five days but part of the journey of any trip is homecoming. And seeing that I got back yesterday at 1:40 in the evening and sleep. I met up with everyone today and told them how it went. I gave everyone their gifts I brought back ( the real adventure is seeing if I can make it thought my Nana reunion even though I don\u2019t see her much anyways.

ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Michael Wehmeyer.  It looks at ways that severely disabled students can be made more independent.  From the ERIC Digest:  Promoting the self-determination of students with disabilities has become best practice in special education, particularly in promoting more positive transitions from school to post-school life. Promoting self-determination means addressing skills, knowledge, and attitudes students will need to take more control over and responsibility for their lives.    While efforts to promote self-determination are in place, most of the methods, materials, and strategies they use do not adequately address the instructional needs of students with severe disabilities (Wehmeyer, 1998).    Wehmeyer, Agran, and Hughes (2000) surveyed 1,200 teachers of students with severe disabilities about their beliefs concerning self-determination and the barriers to providing instruction to promote this outcome. Some of barriers they identified are:    * Lack of student benefit from instruction in self-determination (42%)    * Insufficient training or information on promoting self-determination (41%)    * Lack of authority to provide instruction in this area (32%)    * More urgent need for instruction in other areas (29%)    * Lack of teacher knowledge of curricular/assessment materials and strategies (17%)\n\nText 2:urlLink Introducing First-Year Student-Athletes to the Library  I just gave a tour and orientation session for the freshmen football players.  They were a good group and I enjoyed teaching to them.  I got excellent questions and commentary from them as well.  One of the students sat at the instructor station.  Before he could finish his joke and take another seat, I drafted him and had him type in the examples while I walked around the room and lectured.  I bet he doesn't forget his library orientation!    Anyway, later I told a colleague about the session.  Unfortunately, I got the 'athletes are pampered, dumb, and given special treatment' response from her.  I was annoyed but not surprised.  Bias against student-athletes is rampant in higher education.  How pampered are athletes?  Lets see, they have no free time as they are always required to be in class, practicing, at a study table, or travelling to games.  They are forbidden to hold jobs.  And they have to jump through multiple NCAA requirements like the 'do not gamble' seminar every semester.  And people assume they are dumb and look down on them.  For this, they get no payment except for free classes, food, and a dorm room.  Mind you, the university will profit financially from their labor even as the athletes don't.  Few make it to the pros.   If sports in higher education is bad, then let's move to eliminate them.  In the meantime, we should not give the student-athletes anything but our best.  They are not responsible for the system.  We owe the athletes a quality education.  Being taught about library skills is an important part of this process.  Librarians need to reach out to student-athletes and help educate them and provide them with services.  This is one special population that needs the outreach.  I hope the anti-athlete bias is becoming rarer and starting to die at most places."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I first met him while visiting JHU during my senior year of high school.  It was during Asian Perspectives weekend and I wanted to see what the ministries were like in college, so I checked out this ministry called 'Agape'.  After it was over, I he walked over and greeted me with his trademark, sortof aloof grin. 'Hey.'  The conversation consisted of greetings, introductions, and then he asked me if I had met his brother Jeff, who was also visiting. (No, I hadn't then.)  There was a connection made, at least on my part, that I knew would begin a good lasting friendship.  4.5 years later, we're still friends, and I'm the lucky one.  Why?  The guy has passion for the Lord, passion to live a life of integrity, and a passion for worship.  It rubbed off on me some over the years, especially from serving on worship team under his tutelage.  Sure, he's a bit goofy, and sure, he makes the corniest jokes, but he makes up for it with his genuine, fun-loving personality.  He's also one of the most considerate people I know.  He's always concerned about the good of those around him, and not just by doing the big things, but by consistently remembering the little things.  I remember, I think it was my freshman year, where he was one of the few people that remembered my birthday.  Heck, I never even told him my birthday, so it was a surprise to me that he sent a card.  Thanks Edmund, that made my day.  What also made my day was something he mentioned to me the first Sunday I attended Hope Chapel after I decided to attend, last year.  It was after service, and he pulled me aside with that sheepish grin again, and said something along the lines of,  'Hey, man, you'll make a difference here. God will do a lot through you.'  Up till that moment, I just wasn't too sure, but yeah, that really perked me up.  There's a lot else that I could say, but I just want to leave it at that.  Ladies, consider:  he's caring, he's thoughtful, he loves the Lord... and he's going to be a doctor.  $$!  j/k.  Thanks for the friendship, Edmund.  Man, I miss Baltimore already.\n\nText 2:The nonsense surrounding AC Wharton and the 'proposed' budget he submitted to the County Commission finally gelled into an idea for a graphic.

I suppose I should figure out if I like someone back right?  Anyway, yesterday Andy visited and we walked around downtown, ate at the Roaring Fork, watched  Daredevil  and went to the party at Jeff's.  It was cool. Andy is my first visitor. The Roaring Fork is pretty good, and the place is much nicer on the inside than you would think from the outside. It's somewhat pricey, but I guess the food is good and you do get soup or salad and 2 sides with whatever you order. I was disappointed by the beer selection, because usually those rustic themed places have good beer. It was just room temperature Labatt.  Daredevil wasn't bad or good. The logical gaps just made it annoying and there were some problems with the flow of the story.  The party was good. It was you're usual excessive drinking and talking to fellow grad students or complaining about school stuff type talk. Andy, Wataru, Tami, Ai and I went to Kennedy Fried Chicken around 2:30 AM to get some nuggets. Then Andy and I had to wait around for an hour for a cab to take us home.

I also loved the soundtrack. In the scene I was all like... 'wait a minute... hmm... THAT'S A COVER OF THE BUZZCOCKS!'  Earlier in the day, I had an interview at Dietrichs in Laguna Beach. It went ok. Man it was such a nice day for a drive down to Laguna via the 133 and along PCH (on my way home). It was so beautiful and it just felt so nice seeing the Pacific Ocean again.

Well, it is an interesting enough contest that I'm paying attention on some level:  Here's an interesting quote from an  urlLink AP story :   Bustamante's outlook resembles that of Iraq's information minister during the final days of the war with the United States in April, said David Schecter, a government professor at California State University, Fresno.   'Bustamante's job is to blow a little smoke,' he said. 'He's back on his heels and on the defensive.'  'For Bustamante, this thing has spiraled out of control. The fat lady is on the stage and is just about ready to sing,' Schecter added...   So they're comparing Bustamante to the Iraqi Information Minister, during the final days of the war?

I got up late and rushed to put on some clothes.  And put my hair up in a high bun.  Then off to go pick up Paula.  When I got to class we were reading and the sort.  At snack, I showed Christine and Brittany my Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich my aunt made me.  I laughed and told them that I felt like I was back in elementary again.  :)  And then when the bell rang I went to go to class and noticed Javier right next to me and then He said 'Hey Michelle' and I turned to my side, he was going up the stairs and I smiled and said 'Hey Javier!' Then I went to my class.  And Erika, Robert and I were writing notes to each other.  At the end of the class, Erika and Malcom were being really disgusting!  They were throwing spitballs at each other, except the one that Malcom threw landed on my sleeve.  It was soooo disgusting!  But Erika got back at him for doing that to me.  Ahh.  Even more disgusting then what Malcom did.  She got a whole piece of paper and put it in her mouth, she chewed on it until class ended and she put it in the back of Malcom's shirt.  Ewwwwwwh!  Anyways, I searched for Paula and didn't see her so I went to go walking home by myself.  *sigh*  I walked past Javier and his two wierd friends, and they just stared at me, and told Javier I was passing by and he got a piece of paper from his backpack and threw it at me.  I looked at the paper and threw it back at him and we smiled at each other.  Hah.  He's an awesome friend!  :D  He's probably one of my best friends, mostly because of his sister.  But I think we might like each other.  I try to get a picture of him but it's hard.  And I met up with Paula later on.  We started to walk home and then I saw my aunt and she gave us a ride.  And then I went to go get my hair done at the saloon.  And I got new shampoo to keep the color in longer!  \\/\\/|-|33333!  And then I went to my cousins house and we hung out there for a bit, We talked about how short she was and lol.  Poor Armine.  And then I went home and Allyssa called and gave me a speech why she wants me to pass 9th grade.  Dude.  I am going to pass, but she can't tell me what to do.  We had an argument like this before.  But bigger, but she drives me insane sometimes.  Voice Lessons are going to be at 2:00 on Wed.  Well better go to bed.  Paula's mom is going to drive us to skool tomarrow!  *hugs* Love ya!

If you look at the psychology of markets, as well as individuals, the trend we've seen as of late with markets wildly gyrating at the smallest sneeze from Greenspan, is rather disturbing.  I mean, if these people don't have their own ideas of where markets are headed, the people we pay MILLIONS for their opinions, how good can that be?    This is one of the reasons I didn't get into investment management right out of college - something I'd primped myself for for a long time.  It really is a load of hogwash.  If you have a math degree, and can model, you're the same off as the next guy (once you get to a certain point).  Investors have been relying less and less on MARKET and COMPANY fundamentals, and more on playing the guessing game of 'whats the Fed gonna do', 'where's the next big hit gonna be'.  Folks, they are guessing games.    It all comes back to todays society, the 'gimme gimme's' and 'I want it now!now!NOW!'.  Everyone wants to get rich quick, take a ride down easy street.  The stock market, and increasingly other financial 'vehicles' are seen ever more as the means to the end.  This ideology was what led to the boom of the late 90's, and I'm concerned that the bubble hasn't really popped.  If that's the case, we should REALLY be concerned, as whats held up the economy over the last year (refinancing equity out of homes) - is eroding, and the erosion will continue and accelerate as rates increase.    So, maybe the Fed IS onto something.  But the flip side to that is, you can't manipulate a market forever, again, as we saw in the late 90's  :|\n\nText 2:...that makes me emo?  I mean, seriously.

It is a background and issues paper for the first national roundtable on information literacy conducted by the Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) and held at the State Library of Victoria 28 February 2001.  From the site:   Information literacy - what is it?   Information literacy is an understanding and set of abilities enabling individuals to \u2018recognise when information is needed and have the capacity to identify, locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information\u2019.  An information literate person is a person who has learned how to learn, and is able to      * recognise a need for information     * determine the extent of information needed     * access the needed information efficiently     * evaluate the information and its sources     * incorporate selected information into their knowledge base     * use information effectively to accomplish a purpose     * understand economic, legal, social and cultural issues in the use of information     * access and use information ethically and legally     * classify, store, manipulate and redraft information collected or generated     * recognise information literacy as a prerequisite for lifelong learning   Information literacy - why?   Information literacy is required because of proliferating information access and resources.  Individuals are faced with diverse, abundant, information choices\u00bein their studies, in the workplace, and in their lives.  Information is available through community resources, special interest organisations, manufacturers and service providers, media, libraries, and the internet.  Increasingly, information comes unfiltered.  This raises questions about authenticity, validity, and reliability.  In addition, information is available through multiple media, including graphical, aural, and textual.  These pose special challenges in evaluating, understanding and using information in an ethical and legal manner.  The uncertain quality and expanding quantity of information also pose large challenges for organisations of all types, and for society itself.

Panda, while I feel that guilt is usually a pointless emotion, I feel that it's especially true when considering Ash Wednesday service.  God really doesn't care if you're there or not.  He's got like 6 billion people to worry about, and so he stopped tracking church attendance ages ago.  Unfortunately, he's been keeping this info on the down-low, so not a lot of people are aware of this.  Plus, The Church doesn't even consider it a holy day, so even the bureaucrats don't care.  On the plus side, Santa is still keeping a naughty/nice list, so the pure-of-heart are still rewarded, while the evil are punished.  Yesterday I went to Ash Wednesday Mass with Duf and Anjali (I thought it was nice that they joined me).  It had a 'centering' effect on us (or at least me), but it was quickly lost on Duf when he later had a little run-in with the valet at our hotel.

Second off, here's my F5 on a Monday...    1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?   I'm always reading something, but the bulk of it is newspapers and magazines.  My favorite newspapers are the NY Times and the StarTribune.  My favorite magazine is Vanity Fair, and Entertainment Weekly is something I'll eventually have to wean myself off of.  I also like reading both novels and non-fiction books.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My two all time faves are The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Life After God by Douglas Coupland (though I dont think this one is technically a novel).  I also have to site To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee as a sentimental favorite  Ms. Tyson read it to us in seventh grade, and it taught me that books read in school can be cool.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Okay, its not exotic, and probably says more about the fact that I saw The Outsiders at an impressionable time in my life than anything else but here goes:  Natures first green is gold Her hardest hue to hold Her early leafs a flower; But only so an hour Then leaf subsides to leaf So Eden sank to grief So dawn goes down to day Nothing gold can stay   4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  Im a slow reader and I have to have great interest in anything to read it, so I have a pile of books that I swear Ill get to but I never will, and books that I made it 1/2 way through, and I swear I'll complete.   5. What are you currently reading?  Tender Is The Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I told CK2 how much I liked The Great Gatsby and she told me that I would like TITN even better.  So Im being obedient.  I just started it, so its too early to tell if its as good.   Third off, I'm in a ridiculously good mood this morning... I don't know why.  It is Monday, fer chrissakes...\n\nText 2:I woke up with a new sense of purpose, and it really feels good, I feel healthy which is a bit strange since last night I drowned more than half a bottle of Bacardi, and 1 glass of straight Jack Daniels, plus 2 joints, I know fucked up huh? Also had one cigarette and it really was dumb because I was weak and it didn't even feel nice. Before you go with your groans of dissapointment and evil letters (because I know you care, ha, ha) that slip up let me really realise how much I want to quit. Really serious folks, it's over, those things and me are just no longer friends. I am also going to say that Beenie did not smoke...wo-hoo! I am so proud of her and she is very strong and we must all support her in this evil time of cigarette withdrawl. I've been up since 9am too.... looked everywhere for things to clean and realised that we have to go grocery shopping because we don't have sponges to wash the dishes with...and the dishwashing brush is coated with Vicks Vapo-Rub... eeeew...eeeeeeew....greasy Vaseline stinky shit....also although I feel healthy it's because I'm doped up on drugs and this morning when I opened my eyes I thought my nose and brain had been glued shut...I'm serious. Oh this is funny...CB twisted my arm this morning, in his sleep, perhaps around 6-7am...he grabbed my arm and just twisted it really fucking hard....and I screamed awake and he woke up all shitshitshitshit I'm so sorry!...hmmm....he was having nightmares all night, fuck man I am getting worried. Met the new neighbours, and they are really cool, I think I made a fool of myself when I met them though because I was totally drunk, and I don't remember what I said...but I think it was bad...and embarrasing...something about JS and her flatmate (evil neighbours of ours) and how they like to be nudie....well they DO....but should I have said that? and should I have mentioned our dealer?? like our neighbourhood dealer? what if they are cops??...undercover cops...hmm...no...no..couldn't be... Yeah I have to stop doing all these weird drugs....messing with my mind... Well I just finished reading Wurz's latest addition to her blog, and alright, it's all cool. I'll stop there because censure sometimes is a good thing, and I respect Brian, and I know I'm a blunt rude bitch, that's the reason why so many people remember me. Take it or leave it. We went out to Kings Cross last night, red light district, Been pushed us into an Adult Store, she's so funny....last night eyed red from so much drinking and smoking joints, she blurted out 'I think being a comedian is the only thing I am interested in...' and I was like 'Then you are going to have to start performing in comedy clubs, that's how Bill Hicks started' and she got all contrite and said in a small voice.. 'yeah..'. She'll rock as a stand up...everyone if you see Beenie in the street...push her into a comedy club....it just might stop her pushing me into Adult Stores...I went in there drunk trying on the sequins giggling with a Scooner in my hand....spent 26 bucks on Taxis, and I think I talked to a Drag Queen...but I think that was a dream because I had watched Australian Idol earlier that night....oh man that show is weird! .. what else... I don't know what else I can tell you... except that in 10 minutes I have go wake everyone up... I want those dishes done! I have a lot to do tomorrow."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Over the last year or two I've kind of blown hot and cold on what he does - like Mark Thomas he does that self-satisfied thing a bit too much and I find it irritating - but Ashley points out that he's as self-aggrandising as he is because he wants to be  as much of a nuisance as he can possibly be . He wants to hog the limelight and shout about what he believes, and to do that you have to be populist, brash and confident. And god knows it's hard getting across a liberal perspective in the States.   'But now America has Michael Moore. He's huge. Huge personally - a great big hairy doughball of a man. He's huge commercially. He's huge on the web. And he's huge in the scale of his ambition - he is determined to bring down George Bush'   Having read some reviews, I  really  wanna see  urlLink Fahrenheit 911!\n\nText 2:I need to be alone.  Forget everything about this life, just rest forever.  Forget about all my memories; forget all the possibilities that may still linger.  My soul was taken from me along time ago, I cannot even remember when it was.  My heart is lost, confused, broken and shattered.  I am so alone.  When all this had began, I hoped I was the only one feeling this pain, for it is unbelievable and unreal that someone can feel all this hurt inside.  I\u2019ve wanted to find something I\u2019ve wanted all my life, true love, someone that cared for me.  She came too late.  I am feeling hallow.  Often my wrists have bled there crimson tears, but never did anybody notice.  My wounds cried so many times.  Screaming for someone to heal them, my heart constantly trying to keep me breathing, but without the willingness, I cannot grant it that one wish.  The emptiness of my life, a void that has yet to be filled.  I\u2019m paranoid.  I\u2019m uptight.  I feel like everyone is always watching me, staring at me, waiting for me to do something wrong.  Now that I have you're full attention, you are going to hear me out, like it or not.  I hate everyone that breath's except for a chosen few.  I hate everything about this world, from the smallest bug to the biggest tree, I hate it all.  I often wonder why I hear voices, why I never put my pain on display, or ever set it free.  Instead of letting my pain, my anguish free, I let it form deep within me, let it become me.  I am my pain, and my pain is me.  It never goes away, they never leave.  Haunting me for age's it seems.  I have tried to cut them out, tried to cry them out.  I opened my sounds, bleed them out.  Nothing worked, the only way to calm them was to take pills, to feed the urges.  I am so confused; I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worth fighting for.  Why do I scream? Why do I breath?  I finally found a cure.  Death.  Felo-De-Se.  The act of self annihilation.  I often say things that I don\u2019t mean, but at the same time, I mean them.  Tonight I am taking my own life, painting my pain on my walls.  Blood is the letters, crimson regret is my clarity.  I have fallen into a hopeless black void.  I cannot stop my fall; tonight I shall meet the devils advocate.  I cant trust anybody.  All truth slips through the cracks in the ground, and the lies, being bigger than the truth, and in stronger numbers, is all the stays in my lost mind.  I will no longer waste myself on you.  Who is you? You is whoever is reading this, you are hardly worth my time or breath.  If you are Jill, I love you and you are worth it.  If you are anybody else, I care not about what you think of me.  Nobody listens to me.  I told you everything there is to know about me.  All my fears that I kept well hidden, all my pain and stress I kept as a goal in life, to overcome it.  As you can see, I have also failed that.  I gave you so many warnings.  But you were not listening.  I spoke so clearly to all of you, and at one point even told you my exact feelings.  You weren\u2019t listening.  This is my session of peace of mind.  Keeping everything silent, no more voices, no more screams, no more anger, no more hate, no more hopeless dreams, no more denial.  Everything I ever did was nothing more but another mistake to you.  I tried to make everyone happy by being what he or she wanted me to be.  It overtook my soul, and I became so afraid to be myself, that I pretended to be who I was not.  Every step that I take is too much.  To much stress that has conversed upon my black heart.  I\u2019m tired of being what you want me to be.  Its so funny how I found myself in tears day after day, wondering why I was cursed to live in this hapless world.  Why was I created? What was my purpose? Was it just to feel all this pain in my heart? I was a waste of life, a waste of air, a waste of food, of everything.  The blood is running trough my veins still, keeping me alive long enough to write this.  To express all my hurt and anger into this one letter to the world.  Ever since that first day where I gave myself paper cuts and showed everybody, someone should have known or taken a clue from that.  I had to feed the pressure in myself.  Its under my skin, tearing at me, slowly killing me.  I fed it by giving it what it wanted, crimson regret.  I keep looking over my shoulder, thinking someone is taking to me, but all it is is a new voice inside the back of my head.  So many voices I hear now.  Anger, Hate, Love, Hope, Death, God, Satan, Angels, Demons.  It\u2019s a whirlwind inside of my head.  You people make me sick.  All these words are ignorant.  Every time you talk to me, I take one step closer to the edge of life, treating every time to jump and die.  I want you all to shut up about life.  Shut up and quit you're bitching about the world.  You don\u2019t know how it feel's like to be like this.  Being on the edge all you're life, and finally getting to the end of you're rope keeping you safe.  Burning it to finally fall.  No matter how hard I tried, I will never see another day.  I am not sorry for what I have done.  So much trouble in my mind, I could care less about how you think of me now.     More about myself, there is a lot to say, I cannot seem to express all my feelings, all my thoughts.    I once sought to find a meaning for my existence.  I often confused what was real, thinking things that I dreamed were real, and it ends up they were not.  There is something deep inside of me that grows and grows.  I\u2019m finally ready to unleash it.  Let the world feel my pain.  I\u2019m falling lower and lower and confusing everything.  My walls are closing in, I can barely breath, and I feel the shadow's dept also closing in on me.    I stare up at the neo sky some nights, thinking how it would be life to finally be in that final resting place.  How it would be to go outside of this earth, and beyond.  What is beyond? Nobody knows.  But maybe, just maybe, its better than here.  I\u2019m always wondering why to everything, instead of asking myself how?  Soon I\u2019m going to run away from everything, and never again wonder why.  Open up my eyes to death, then close them once I take my last breath.      I don\u2019t know what to do.  I\u2019m so confused and lost.  I\u2019m crying everyday.  I\u2019m so alone.  I\u2019m stuck on the outside.  I once felt the hate rise up from the pit of myself.  Eventually, I will be but a distant memory.  Remembered by none.  I tried so hard to make it, but everyone was always mocking me.  You would not recognize me anymore, with my true self being revealed to the world.  You never knew me.  None of you ever knew me.    I\u2019ve always wanted to live underground.  Its strange, and I cannot explain this urge, but it would free me of my pain.  Keeping it underground, stuck beneath the earth, and by force, over take the evil energies around me and turn them into positive.  Would never feel the heat of the sun upon my pale flesh, never have to worry about daylight or darkness, just my own hallow cave.  Hiding away from the world, keeping myself hidden from everything so that no one would know I exist.  I could hurt nobody that way now could I? That\u2019s one of the only things I\u2019m good at now, hurting people.  I tried to let all my pain go, let it leave me and put all my trust and love into somebody.  Too many times I was hurt, too many times my trust was turned into pain and it became forged into the very core of my soul.  And now I feel like I have to run away, escape it all.  I don\u2019t know what I will be searching for, but I know if I try hard enough, I will find it.  The moment I feel it close to me, the moment I can touch it, I will know I found it.  Ill crawl my way to it if I must.  I\u2019m calmer than a heartbeat that is on a flat line; I fear not death or any of its ways.  I embrace the kiss of death every night, I pray I die and that death's depth will come and will me away.  There is barely any more joy's in life for me.  But I found one, sleep.  When I sleep, I feel like, I\u2019m dead, even though it lasts but a few minutes, I seem to be in peace.  I dream so many wonderful things.  Love and happiness find there way into my mind, and I dream them.  It is amazing how happy I am when I dream, its like, I\u2019m in another world, another dimension.  Still, when I wake up, I am forced back to reality and see that I am forced to live another day in this horrible world.  Sleep is the closest thing to death without actually meeting death."], "gold_label": 0.0}

The events and activities that I am involved in neither require my existence nor would be significantly different if I were not existence. Don't get the wrong idea here- this isn't one of those 'now I must leave you, goodbye...' Suicide notes, goodness. I guess what I'm trying to say is that my problem is that I don't know the problem.  Everything was particle's peach a month ago... I had a girlfriend (which I subsequently broke up with, something I still think is correct and gave me a few precious social points, LOL) and I felt I had some sort of purpose in life. But before that, I had some sort of 'connected with the world' thing going on, setting my purpose as to, redundantly, find my purpose.  However, I get back to my original problem: my existence is slim to none, which brings me to the title of my exploration.  While I clearly want to be part of this thing we call society, my problem has to do with choice- not in simple 'do I want to or not' sense, but my choices afterwards. Does my mind and heart say that I want to be in society, yet my hand and mouth waver away from the human spectacle? Am I choosing the incorrect path to my entrance into society, and thus, my choice is no?  Then again, choice itself is a problem... Whether or not we have actual choice in life, we will never really know. (just watch the first two Matrix movies and you get a pretty good idea about the whole 'am I choice or being controlled?' concept. If not, watch the second one again- I had to ;) However, if I don't have that choice, then what purpose do I have here, running around with no visible or implied impact on the Earth as it is? How does this lead me to becoming a better person, or a place in life? People tell me almost everyday about how I'm going to be something big, or something along the same lines, but this sheltered life stunts the growth of social skills that I need to communicate with people- the most important skill on the face of the Earth. (What have been the most important revolutions in the past 1000 years? The book, the telegraph, the radio, the telephone, the television, the internet. See something?)  So, with this heavy feeling in my breast, I headed to the only place in my mind that seemed like I still belonged, or was visible: English 1-2 Honors, Mrs. Kimberly Richey. I have that weird feeling like I have to return home or something. However, I waited and waited, and she was no show. I instead went to my personal confidant, Mrs. Kimberly Stansberry. (Spielman (I hope I spelled that right...)) I have that weird feeling around her that we are cut from the same cloth... Visions of the same person at different periods of time, something like that, LOL. I told her that things were going pretty crappy, school's boring, even in the hardest coarse loads. The only advice she offered was 'Hang in there.' A persistent voice within my lifetime- it will come.  I wouldn't mind waiting half as much if I knew what I was waiting for, or who, or a clue to something of my sum total. But, as mere humans, I must live with the limited foresight that I have into my immediate future, vision of what I think is the present, and hindsight and horrors of my past.  And, returning again to my problem, my problem is choice. I choose to wait. I choose to be who I am. I choose to believe in the future.  in love.  in hope.  in faith.  in life.  The problem is choice...  I just hope it's the right one...\n\nText 2:Last night Robert and I went to see The Killers in concert. We were both pretty excited about the show as it was going to be our last concert together before I hit the road ... as well as this being one of our favorite bands! So here we are at the Forum -one of London's oldest and possibly coolest venues- getting excited for what's promising to be a great night. We'd checked my bag, gotten ourselves a few drinks and moved along the main floor to watch the back up band until the show started. The back up was made up of two guitarrists who played as well as Lenny Kravitz ... no joke.       So we're casually standing there, bobbing our heads as you do in a concert when all of a sudden one of the guitarrists throws a percussion instrument into the crowd. Unbeknownst to me, this projectile hits Robert square in the head. His initial reaction is: 'Did you see that? That thing just hit me in the head!!' So that's when I turn around. Of course ... me being the shorter one of the two, I didn't see a thing. But next thing I know is that blood is gushing down his forehead... Robert tries to blow it off, saying he's ok but as more and more blood kept pouring out, I insisted he go get some first aid. Now get this - as we approach the bouncer, he tries to kick Robert out of the venue, thinking he'd been involved in a fight, and of course we had to explain the story to him and then the manager and then the first aid nurse. And that's when we're told 'You've got to go to the hospital mate - I think you need stitches!' They call us a cab and Robert insists that I stay for the show...which I did in the end. There was no point in arguing as he wasn't going to give in.   I make my way upstairs ... steering clear of any other mishaps along the way. I buy myself a Red Stripe and The Killers come on. Song after song, the show just keeps getting better. Suddenly Robert comes up the stairs with a Jack and Coke in hand ... and glue in his hair. He walked just in time for our our favorite song looking cool and relaxed. Lucky for him, they managed to glue his wound, instead of giving him stitches. He missed half the show but was there for the best bit...  As we walked out of the venue the first aid nurse came over to check on Robert and give him a once over before we headed home. That's when the 'friendly' bouncer came to find us, stressing that the manager wanted to see us. He takes us into the back room and apologises profusely for the incident. He explains that the band is very sorry about what happened and would like to send him a gift in sympathy of what he endured that night (and for missing the show!)... All in all, I came out with a free t-shirt and Robert will shortly be receiving a special care package from the Killers themselves! Despite our 'adventure' the night ended well and the show was amazing!! I guess you should always expect the unexpected ... wherever you are."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I thought  Jackass: The Movie  was sheer genius.  I don't remember laughing so hard in my life...well, in the last couple of years anyway.  I personally thought the end thing (after the credits) with them as old men was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of exessiveness.  Anyway.  As for Kevin Smith latest foray: I haven't seen it and I highly doubt I ever will.  I struggled through  Dogma  which was such an over-rated piece of crap, I kind of felt cheated.  Was I offended by it because I'm religious?  No, and for the record, I'm about as agnostic as they get.  I just thought the performances were awful (Linda Fiorentino was horrible) and that snootchie-bootchie shit is for the birds.  After seeing 'Shitma' in the theatres, I swore off seeing any more Jay & Silent Bob movies.  They pantsed me on Mallrats and I felt taken again with Dogma.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me. The funniest thing is, ol' Kevie Smith peaked at Clerks and that was the flick he did with the smallest budget.  Oh...if anyone is wondering how  Gangs Of New York  is, I can sum it up in a couple of words: Waste Of Time.  Easily one of the worst (and most boring) movies I've seen in a long time.

Had to wake up around 10 to run errands, then wound up heading to the city to hang around with a few folks.  Jonas and I wanted to tour a few ships during this fleet week, but the uppity security made lines to get on ships insanely long, so we opted out.  We met up with Micky and some of his friends for sushi.    After a good and spicy few rolls, we parted ways.  Jonas and I walked by the Mormon temple up on Columbus in the 60's, and it was open to the public for tours.  When else in my life will I ever get to see a Mormon temple without accepting Jesus Christ as my lord and savior?  The guide said the tour was formal, so Jonas decided to opt out.  The irony was not lost on either of us, that a Jewish kid from Wisconsin and an Ismaili Muslim from Long Island were standing in the NYC Mormon Temple.    The tour guide was an Asian dude who spoke very quietly and with a heavy accent.  That wiped out my first stereotype about the Mormons (that they were all white).  So after having to sit through a 15 minute video about the history of Mormons and Mormon Temples, we had to slip these plastic booties over our shoes (they said it was just to protect the carpeting, but I don't know if that's the whole reason though).  We toured the Temple, and I have to say that it is an extremely remarkable structure.  The first thing we saw is the baptismal Font, which has three huge statues of Oxen on each side (representing the 12 tribes of Israel).  I thought it looked like a jacuzzi without the jets.  I admit I did picture myself relaxing in the pool, preferably with a cold drink in my hand (I don't think the Mormons would appreciate that thought though).    But the rooms of the Temple are beautifully decorated and designed.  Most have fresh flowers and very pleasant lighting.  The Temple has carvings of beehives all over the place, which is supposed to symbolize the work and commitment that goes into their community.  But what really struck me is that they didn't have a big central congregation hall.  It was more like a series of smaller rooms, all beautifully decorated.  The guide kept saying it was designed to feel the presence of God and all that, and I could definitely see what he was talking about.  But I didn't feel holy in that place.  It reminded me more of a very beautiful wedding chapel (which I guess is intentional, since marriage is a huge part of their faith), very earthly and paradisical, but not spiritual.  But I could definitely see how others could feel peaceful and spiritual in that place.  Kudos to the Mormons.    In the end, they gave us free cookies!  In the end, it was apparent that the Mormons are an extremely wealthy community who like to reinvest their wealth into their Temples and communities.  That's absolutely amazing that they do that and keep humble about it.  All the Mormons I met there were very enthusiastic about their faith, but extremely nice people.  Got a lot of polite smiles and greetings.  They're a good group, all the best to them.  I'm pretty happy being an Ismaili though, so no plans of conversion... But I do see no problem in learning and appreciating others.\n\nText 2:Checked my  urlLink 'scope  this morning  Sometimes these things are just so dead on its scary.

ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Susan Imel.  It relates how students can use career development to find meaningful work.  From the ERIC Digest:  This above all, to thine own self be true. (Shakespeare)    I think there is a 'sweet spot' that each of us has...It's the kind of work we want to perform, the kind of work that makes us proud. But finding that sweet spot requires deep self-knowledge. You start by looking at the work you are drawn to. You try it, you evaluate the experience, and you evolve as you discover more about it. I think of this process as developmental self-interrogation. You're working on a mental model of yourself--always. (Larry Smith, quoted in Warshaw 1998)    The attacks of September 11, 2001 prompted many people to ask 'What am I doing with my life?' (Cannon 2002, p. 44) and 'Am I really living the way that I want to live?' (Boyatzis, McKee, and Goleman 2002, p. 87). Some individuals have responded by changing to careers that have more meaning for them; for example, one woman left a secure job in manufacturing to help homeless women in the Chicago area (Cannon 2002). Although the traumatic and shocking events of that day caused many individuals to stop and take stock of their careers, others have been quietly seeking more satisfying and meaningful work lives for a number of years. An article titled, 'Boomers Trade Security for Freedom,' published in the ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH on March 19, 2001, for example, began with the statement 'many baby boomers, unfulfilled by corporate jobs at which they've worked for years, are deciding to give up the great pay and benefits to do what they want to do' (Hudson 2001, p. 8). These examples support emerging perspectives that view work as an expression of meaning.

This is true at Central Michigan University as well.  I asked one of my students to write an article about her experiences.  Here is the result.  From the article:  ' Library instructions have always been taught by the librarians from my experience and when a group of us were told that teaching those sessions were going to be a part of our duties it was surprising and a little nerve wrecking.  As with most, I was not one to feel comfortable in front of a group, so to say the least I was a tad nervous.  After being told that we were now going to be doing these sessions we were trained on how to do them.  All of us had already seen many of the instructional sessions before so the concept was not all that new.  We were given a sheet that read like a script which was going to be what we would teach.  I read through the sheet and it did not look challenging and it set me at ease.  Everything that we were to instruct was so second nature and there was nothing new to be learned.  One of the nicer aspects of the library instructional sessions conducted by students is that the groups that we teach are never at a level higher than we are studying.  The groups that the students teach are at the 101 level of courses, high school students, or visiting groups not affiliated with the university.  For those reasons the instructional sessions that we teach are basic introductions to Central Michigan University's home page and the library itself.'

This is particularly true for web supported courses for distance learning students.  Do students actually use this content?  This is a full-text article from  Academic Exchange Quarterly  written by Rafi Nachmias and Limor Segev of Tel-Aviv University in Israel which looks at how students use online content placed on the web for their use in a course.  Abstract:  'The use of the Internet as an instructional tool in higher education is rapidly increasing. We are witnessing the development of huge amounts of learning materials for academic web-sites. Still, there is little empirical evidence regarding the actual use of these contents by students. In this study, computer logs are used in order to evaluate how online contents are consumed, the individual differences among students in terms of contents usage are investigated as are the amount of contents that is presented in courses' web-supported sites. Finally, further implications of information related to content usage are discussed, and their relevance for the evaluation of ICT implementation in higher education institutes is shown.'

But I got a lot of shit done at work.  I think it's cuz I've been slacking off for the last month so after this weekend I felt all recharged and ready to work.  It also helps that I'm back to doing stuff I like to do.  Don't worry, my boss reminded me that I still have to take care of all the other shit I was supposed to do after I get this more important stuff taken care of.  So another interesting thing that happened today was that the cousin of the ex called me and told me he couldn't deposit her tax refund check because the account was closed.  I didn't know anything and I sure a hell didn't want to help.  So I don't know.  I did feel bad for blowing him off so I called back later and told him that I was sorry for being mean to him.  It was funny being able to say 'so...' when he told me what was going on.  I'm chuckling right now, in fact.  BTW, it is getting easier and easier not to think about the breakup and crap.  I think I'm through the angry, bitter stage now.  I wonder what stage is next.  Anyways, it's fucking 3:20am so I should get to sleep.  I'm gonna miss yet another day of morning surfing.  My friend are gonna stop asking me to go soon.  I think one of them has already given up on me.  I have to get my act together and get on some sort of regular schedule.  Damn, I just remembered I have to be at work earlier tomorrow to meet a vendor....  Aw shit... while I'm at it, I might as well mention that I went to someone's engagement party on Saturday night.  I didn't know anyone there since I was there with a friend of the friend, which makes me nothing.  Anyways, the fiance was freakin cute.  That got me all depressed to I just drank a lot of  vodka tonics, I think 5 or 6, and got thoroughly wasted, all the while checking out the fiance.  She was Japanese.

I hadn't been up there since G, Matt and I spent an evening with Wrestling Superstar Who Used to Be Shinobi. Anyway, I am a die hard New Yorker, to the end hopefully, but there is some weird shit in Times Square. Based on my experience today, I would like to tell you that we live in a world in which:  1. Robert Evans has an animated series about his life (that's actually a plus). 2. Posh Spice shills for hip hop clothing. What the FUCK. 3. Why is my agent/lawyer/advisor spending money for me and my girlfriend to see 'A Boy George musical' that is also a 'Rosie O'Donnell production'. This is BROADWAY? Where are the actors? 4. Jason Patric on Broadway. Nuff said. And no, he's not an actor, he's a method half ass. 5. And to make it worse, he is 'acting' opposite Ashley Judd. 6. Bubba Gump Shirmp Company opens on December 6th. I'll be at Sardi's thanks.  This is all I can think of it. It was too much. I hate myself. Anyway, I ended up getting mom tickets to see Hugh Jackman looking crazy disco gay in THE BOY FROM OZ. and yes, I'm going too. Dan Hamill just told me 'Moms love singing fags'. I would have agreed with this, but Jackman IS Wolverine, so he's tops in my books.  My 'celebrity' sighting was Robert Sean Leonard who looks like my relative who married a woman to cover the fact that he loved men. There's nothing wrong with that! Stop it! Gay is OK. Where the hell are the real stars!  Anyway, this sent me packing right into the Virgin Megastore where they expected me to spend 30 bucks on the new John Cale album. Luckily, Amazon UK has it for like 14 bucks. Screw you Branson. I ALMOST bought the new Interpol single cause it's the Arthur Baker remix, but its just two song. Lousy. Luckily I came to my senses and ran home, where I now have to go meet my former student, Edward, who is a nice guy.  Two more remixes have arrived: The first one comes all the way from Japan. SINO, who you can read about in the new Industrial Nation, took an interesting approach to DREAMS TO DEATH and made it a nasty machine dirge. It's very simple, but effective and fits in real nice on the EP. In the meantime, the lads in Cyanotic delivered their remix of THESE MILLION NIGHTS and have taken a drum n bass approach to it. Solid. I'm really happy with it and it gives us something we don't have yet on the record. One thing I have learned from all this is that Tom's vocals remix really well. Remixers love the smooth vocals.  Meanwhile I am working on a remix for a band you all know and love but are curious as to where their new album is. I am just as curious to be honest with you as I thought I would have it by now. Who knows. I'll get back to you on that.

So, a billion thanx to Xue Kun.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; But that's not all.

And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because  we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope . And  hope does not disappoint us , because  God has poured out his love into our hearts  by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.'  -Romans 5:1-5 NIV  The heck?  How do I rejoice in this pain that starts in the middle of my chest and spreads throughout my torso, stifling me till I can't even weep?  How could I listen to and sing these following lyrics?  'Blessed be Your name And blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering Though theres pain in the offering Blessed be Your name  And when the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say, 'Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your name'...  You give and take away, You give and take away My heart will choose to say 'Lord, blessed be Your name''  -  Blessed Be the Name of the Lord , by Matt Redman  How?  How can I get my heart to recognize this as a blessing in disguise?  Who could ever imagine blessing coming from deep, extended betrayal?  I'm bitter that I thought I was responsible for causing pain, but instead, all along I was being  betrayed  behind my back?  Then I think of Judas and Jesus:  'Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: 'The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.' Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, 'Greetings, Rabbi!' and kissed him.  Jesus replied, 'Friend, do what you came for.''  - Matthew 26:48-50  Jesus, what're you doing?  You know that Judas, whom You love, is screwing you over...  You're just going to let Him take advantage of You like that?  'During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him...'  -Hebrews 5:7-9  God, I understand all this in my mind... that You did it all for our good.  But God, how do I actually make this heart rejoice?  I've even tried shouting at my soul to not be downcast, but it hasn't done anything.  I just don't know how to force myself to rejoice in suffering.  Yes, you're teaching me perseverance to teach me character to give me hope so that I won't be disappointed.  Yes, this is all a blessing.  You give and take away, but how can I get this stupid and stubborn heart to GENUINELY cry, 'Blessed be Your Name!' in response?  God, please, teach me. You're the only One that can show me through this... You let me into it after all.  Help me to ignore all the naysayers that say to trust in myself, to simply just let go of something that won't let go of me.  Every blessing You pour out should turn to praise... let this be something that will enable me to praise You at a level so deep and true that those around me may be led to You.  I'm hurting.

This ERIC Digest is by Chia-Hui Chin.  It reviews the concept of literature circles.  From the ERIC Digest:  The reading materials used in literature circles are important to lively and meaningful discussions (Farinacci, 1998). According to Brabham and Villaume (2000), fiction is the most commonly used reading material in literature circles, although other types of texts, such as nonfiction, picture books, and newspaper articles can also be used with great success. Some authors, including Farinacci (1998) and Peralta-Nash and Dutch (2000) have suggested the following criteria for selecting texts to use in literature circles:   * Comprehensible to students of different abilities and interests   * Reflect students' language needs and skills   * Address issues/topics relevant to students' lives   * Provoke students' thinking and discussion   After students have selected the reading materials they wish to read, the literature circles are formed in accordance with their reading interests or book titles they choose.\n\nText 2:Very interesting  urlLink stuff  brewing in the African-American community.  Just when you thought it was the politically correct thing to do as a white male, to blame racism for the ongoing struggles of blacks in America, Bill Cosby upsets the apple cart and says there's no excuse.   During Thursday's speech, Cosby said his detractors were not facing the facts about poor black communities and were just trying to cover up what he called their 'dirty laundry.'   'Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it's cursing and calling each other n----r as they're walking up and down the street,' he said.   Cosby continued railing about the state of black youth in America. 'They think they're hip,' he said. 'They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere.'   To African-American men, Cosby ranted, 'Stop beating up your women because you can't find a job.'   He complained about rap music: 'When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'n----r this' and 'n----r that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car--those children hear that. And I am telling you when you put the CD on and then you get up and dance to it What are you saying to your children?'   And he also ripped into sitcoms targeting African-American audiences: 'Comedians coming on TV [saying,] 'I am so ugly, you are ugly, yuck, yuck.' That's all minstrel show stuff. I am tired of it.'   'I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is'...and I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk,' Cosby said in May. 'And then I heard the father talk...Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth.'   On Thursday, Cosby further elaborated his thoughts on the subject, saying once again that white people aren't to blame for teen pregnancy and high-school dropout rates.   'For me there is a time...when we have to turn the mirror around,' he said. 'Because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us. And it keeps a person frozen in their seat, it keeps you frozen in your hole you're sitting in.'    Easier said than done coming from a very wealthy man?  I don't know.  Does he minimize the very real impact of ongoing racism and socioeconomic inequality clearly held in place by a dominant white power structure?  Could be.  Does what he say have value?  No doubt.  It is not 'Uncle Tom' to take a hard look at how racism and inequality become internalized by the oppressed, to examine how this internalization often manifests as irrational, sometimes self-destructive behavior and cultural trends.    It took guts for Cosby to take this stance and I'm glad Jesse Jackson is supporting him."], "gold_label": 0.0}

During the winter, when I arrive and leave in the dark, the neighborhood has a dingy look - depressing, deprived, scary even?  Now that it is summer I see it in a different light - not exactly where I would want to live, but beautiful in its own way.  This morning the air was cool and fresh, the sunshine sparkling across the farmer's market by the railroad tracks, turning the fruits and vegetables into colorful gems.  Those working at the stands looked happy, bright, and ready for the day ahead.  The customers were beginning to build, everyone looking excited at the prospect of shopping beautiful produce for an equally beautiful 3 day holiday weekend.   Enjoy!\n\nText 2:That title is more my mood than anything.  Because it's certainly not silent in my world right now.   You see, the man that I've talked about quite a bit on this site (though not nearly as much as I could have) was killed in a car accident a week ago tonight.  He's gone.  I made a big deal about saying how my life was going quite well last week.  It isn't anymore.  My world changed.  A lot.  I'm keeping my last thoughts of Ryan and all of that emotional stuff private, but I will share with you all the way my last few days have gone.   His family isn't doing well.  They're not dealing with their grief well at all.  So badly, in fact, that I have taken on all the duties usually related to the family of the deceased.  I planned the visitation.  I planned the funeral.  I notified people.  I am now in charge of dealing with the bill-collectors and the other people that have to be informed that their services are no longer needed.   Do you know what that last little bit entails?  First of all, most companies on this planet don't have any measures in place to deal with those that die.  They don't have anything in their system to deal with it.  Nothing at all.  Second of all, actually being able to deal with these sorts of situations is near impossible if you're not a blood relative, next of kin, or spouse.  I am none of the above.   One of the businesses I'm dealing with is local to our hometown.  The person I spoke with on the phone to deal with this situation was AT the funeral.  He was standing less than four feet from me at the burrial.  He shed at least one or two tears.  He tells me on the phone that I need a death certificate to prove he's dead.  So actually seeing the body wasn't enough for him?  This is refuckingdiculous!   Trying to get the phone shut off is really an issue because this is still in his late wife's name.  He couldn't get them to switch it to his name after she died.  They wanted HER to call in to have it switched.  How exactly does that work?  I don't think they have phones from the great beyond.   In less depressing and annoyed news, I now have fish.  Ryan had a huge aquarium and he treasured those fish.  I couldn't bear to let the poor little guys starve to death, and no one else could take them, so they're here now.  And they make this place a little happier than it was before.  I think it has to do with the sound of the water.  Or maybe it's that there's another living thing in my apartment.  I don't know, but I'm glad I have them.  6:53 pm"], "gold_label": 0.0}

I have meet many librarians who like this show and just as many who are extremely negative towards it.  You either like it or you don't but liking it doesn't mean your are intellectually challenged as some smug academics haughtily imagine.  This show is actually rather sophisticated.  I wish I could on the show.  I'd make a serious run at winning.  This Survivor speculation board has had good conversation in past seasons.  The participants are quite good at guessing which contestants are likely to be booted next.  They rarely nail it right all the time but the posters have good theories that can help narrow the choices down when picking for fantasy points.  Supposedly, the show producer (Mark Burnett) frequents this board under various alias to plant false clues and lead people astray.

Includes a letter written by a 10-year-old Adams to his father.   From the site:  This issue of The Mandate examines the importance of the family in shaping the destiny of a nation. The article on pages 10-11 shows that God the Creator has given parents the great responsibility of overseeing the education and character development of their children. Christian character, which can never be adequately taught in a public school setting, is essential to sustain a free nation.  Modern Americans have ceased, for the most part, to fulfill this obligation. They have turned away from the God who made America great and have produced a generation that is lazy, incapable of shouldering responsibility, dishonest, and forever blame-shifting. Many Chinese students observe these modern Americans and the enormous prosperity they have inherited and conclude that freedom and prosperity must have very little to do with personal character.   But that is not true. We must look deeper to find the truth. The personal history of most early Americans reveals quite a distinct contrast in character to their modern counterparts. A close examination of historic accounts leads to one conclusion: America rose to greatness because of character - and she shall fall, if current trends prevail, for lack of it.  John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States, is an excellent example of this character instilled in early Americans. Born in 1767, John Quincy came from a New England farm family that played a significant role in shaping the course of the United States."], "gold_label": 0.0}

Unfortunately for you and your  fianc?, DJS, you stumbled upon a bad parish.  Regrettably, it's the bad/extreme parishes, priests, bishops, etc that we hear about on the news and from disgruntled ex-Catholics.  And all of these episodes, for most people who hear about them, give the entire church a bad rap.  I'm not saying the Catholic church is perfect.  Not even close.  But it's parishes like the one you experienced that are making people leave the faith.  I definitely know more people who have abandoned Catholicism than have embraced it, and for that I am saddened.  For me, Catholicism should be synonymous with acceptance and embracing of all types of people, forgiveness, holy traditions, the belief in only one God...all the basic Christian ideologies.  Instead, what we hear about are condemnations, the rules associated with 'this is right/this is wrong', corruption, pedophilia, etc, etc.  I went to Catholic grade school, college, and grad school.  I have met some amazing people (priests as well as lay people) who embody all things good about the church.  I just wish more people had the positive experiences with the church like I have.  I also think my parents had a lot to do with that.  DJS, I do not categorize you with my ex - the only way I could do that would be if I thought DJ LZ really cared about the Catholic faith.

For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.\n\nText 2:johnathan - that's an interesting thought.   i had a weird thing happen to me this year, in terms of movies i like: i used to love the purple rose of cairo.  i watched it about 4 months ago and i thought it was one of the most contrived pieces of crap that i'd ever seen - what happened? can a person's taste change that much over the course of a few years?"], "gold_label": 1.0}

The pope, 84 and stricken by Parkinson's disease, wants to make the pilgrimage like any of the other ailing pilgrims who go to Lourdes hoping for a cure from waters in a grotto where the Virgin Mary is to have appeared in 1858, they said.  The Polish-born pontiff wants to mark the 150th anniversary of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which states that the mother of Jesus Christ was born free of original sin.

Nikol, hang in there, I may be a ways away, and we may not get to see each other due to shitty vehicles, but you are always in my thoughts.\n\nText 2:Well, it's been a while. I have been busy doing 'stuff'.  I have actually decided to satrt working out again. I went to the Princeton club today and it felt great!  I have set up to go with Laura to areobics next week.  I have never thought of myself as an aerobics gal, but if I'm there with someone I know, it might be okay.  It seems a little wierd, Laura is a bit older than I am, and her daughters babysit for Ashley, but really, almost all my friends are that age. I guess it just feels different with her because her girls are so much older.  Who knows?  I also organized an outing for the troop to go to the club and meet with a personal trainer and tour the facility. I think that it will be fun.  Our collection for the family that lost their home in the fire is going well. I am so proud of those girls, they are all such good kids, even the new ones that I was worried about are doing a great job. I went out with Mary last weekend, I am afraid that it will be the last time that I see her ever.  We said that we would try to hook up at least one more time, but I think that with the holidays coming, it will be hard. Christopher was with us, and we ran into Franki!  Nikol and I met him the last time that we went out with Mary and we had such a great time making fun of him and calling him 'Nick'.  This time was just as good.  note to self, never get Franki talking about real estate. I got an e-mail from Angela on Monday. I have not heard from her in forever. She is really nice, I feel bad that we didn't 'click' after the first couple of days.  I think that the whole thing, the whole summer and into fall, was a great time of growth for me. I have learned so much and met some great people. I am sure that I have made the right choices, I would have regretted not taking action, but I've also learned that some things are better when left as a fantasy. sigh I do miss Nikol, I have not been able to catch her at all lately. I did get an e-mail reply, but I can never find her on line. I wonder if it has to do with her switching her ID.  I'll have to e-mail again soon. Christopher is bugging me about this blog thing. He wants to read it. I guess he can, It's not a big deal, nothing is secret. I would just hate to have that in the back of my mind all the time, like I'm writing for an audience. I know it's just my husband, but still. Maybe somethings should still be private. He wouldn't want me to read his journals. I know, because I tried that a few years ago! So we saw the third installment of the Matrix. I loved it!  I can not say enough positive things about it!  I think that it was as good as the original, but in its own ways. It can't really be measured against the original, but as a closing of the story, it was everything that I had hoped for. Class is going well, however, there were some disturbing passages. Lots about enochs and even some about being eaten by dogs!  Just a lot of death and above all else, alot of contradiction.  I feel like I was just finding a faith (very ignorant of me) and now that I am really studying it, I am very much questioning what I thought that I had come to believe.  I find it interesting, but I have a really hard time being a real believer. I honestly think of the Bible as a collection of stories. Some of them are great; timeless stories of betrayal, love and human nature.  There are some wonderful lessons learned, and alot of those lessons carry over into today, but honestly, I find most of it just arbitrary and completely unrealistic.  I believe in the behaviors that are characteristicaly Christian, but I don't know what else at this point. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrit, and feel guilt for having been confirmed and becoming a member without having a real knowledge of the faith. It's a constant struggle. Add that to the Non-Christian faith that I was brought up in, and there is just a mess of stuff going on in my little head.  I could go on about this religious topic all day, but I won't.

Visual composition is also good--art production-wise and SFX-wise. Kate Beckinsale is a bit too small/skinny for the role, but she gave the character Selene, a fierce werewolf-hunter, some measure of vulnerability. It's a wild roller-coaster ride, with lots of gore and surprising twists and revelations, such that the bad guys aren't so bad after all, especially Lucien (played by very talented Brit, Michael Sheen).   And guess what,  urlLink ROTK trailer  was attached to the film, so it was more enjoyable. Thirty-foot Legolas looks mighty fine in that hood and blue... erhmm...contacts. And Eomer doesn't look like he's having hissy fit at all. Still can't decide who he was holding.  I guess I had been just movie-deprived in the past weeks, so I also caught 'Once Upon a Time...' last night. It's not a very nice one, and would have been totally ruined if they didn't cast Johnny Depp. He was the film's saving grace and--following the popularity of his swaggering Jack Sparrow in 'Pirates'--selling point. They way they depicted Mexico made it appear as if it was more chaotic than the Philippines. Bah!   I arrived at the G4 cinemas lobby just in time, since people were already qeueing for the film about 40 minutes into the scheduled screening. After buying my supersize Wendy's hamburger combo with biggie fries and liter-size iced tea, I fell in line to get a nice seat. It was weird that G4 didn't have seat reservations for the film. As I had more than an hour to waste on the qeue, there was nothing much to do but figure watch while nibbling my fries. Gawd, the lobby looked like United Nations--Northeast Asians, South Asians, whites with their girlfriends, partners, mistresses, hookers--with a few locals dressed to their party best. I didn't know Makati crowd was this vain. Hmmm... I guess they were trooping to the bars after the film.   If you have been a long-time visitor of this journal, you'd have known that I fancied Billy Boyd. Oh well, here's just a yummy  urlLink wallpaper  with angsty Bonden. Forget the guy in front of him as he's unimportant and the film could still survive without him--that is, if all moviegoers were like me.

You are either compelled by love of your father or hatred of yourself to act against yourself.  You are denying yourself to support your father (or worse to make a big salary).  I cannot imagine what it would be like to suppress who I am in order to maintain the approval of my father, and I won't even try to imagine what kind of father would ask a child to do that.  I wish for you that your father would love you for who you are, that he would support you as you, and that he would recognize the impact of his policies on his family and on families all over America.  I am an African American, and I am married to a white woman. To understand what you are doing, I imagine that my mother is the Vice-President, and that she was advocating for the return of anti-miscegenation laws.  I can tell you that if that happened, not only would I not support my mother's campaign (how could I?  To do it would be self-hatred, and it would be an acknowledgement that the love I feel for my wife is wrong), but I would work for her enlightenment.  If that failed, then I would work for her opponent, and I would be public about it.  Feel free to use my strategy if you want to do so.  Im sure that John Kerry could meet your salary expectations.  The big flaw in your approach is that you are not just denying yourself, you are denying others.  It would be one thing if you made the choice to deny yourself in order to maintain peace at home, but in supporting your father, you are furthering an agenda that is aggressively anti-you and therefore detrimental to those gay and lesbian brothers and sisters with whom you share community.   I wish for you clarity and conversion.  I wish that your father would discontinue his hypocrisy (he cant love you and hate you at the same time  he cant love you privately and hate you publicly either  to love you, he must love you for who you are and he must do so in all settings), and I wish that, as you channeled your energy into supporting your father, you would work twice as hard to get him to provide for you the full blessings and rights to which you are entitled as a human being.

Last night I had the privilege to watch Les Miserables on Broadway, just in time before the production closes May.  It's a given that the play has touching songs and story, so I move on to comment on the production itself.  The incredible amount of detail in each scene blew me away:  the set pieces were well done, the rotating floor kept things moving, and the ad-libbing done by the supporting actors really added to the feel of each scene.  For example, during the scene that introduced Cossette's foster parents, every actor in their tavern carried on audible but unintrusive conversations.  These details gave the scene a lively and bustling ambience.  The person with whom I attended the production noted that I was very quiet.  I had forgotten until hearing observation that I am quiet and pensive when I enjoy watching a movie or play.

I actually cried a bit at the end even though it was a creepy S&M type love story.  But I think Maggie Gyllenhaal is adorable.   urlLink  Slackers  : good, but not that memorable.  I rented it because of my love for Jason Schwartzman.  He plays a very convincing stalker.   urlLink  Vulgar  : disturbing on so many levels.

Full of Grace!'), and claimed it as a  miracle .  I think even my mom would laugh at that one.   urlLink  Blue Car  : good, but depressing.  Saw this in the theater...I'd call it 'Lolita-lite'.   urlLink  Keeping the Faith  : I was surprisingly delighted by this.  Edward Norton and Ben Stiller make a great combo.

PS - 'American Gods' rocks PPS - it's a book\n\nText 2:Something that I was thinking about when reading  urlLink someone's blog entry  was the difference between our hearts and our minds.  I believe that the reason it exists is because of the two are inherently different things; it's like comparing apples and oranges.  I have thought of a good way to explain the difference and the dichotomy by using the following analogies.  1)  Our hearts are like vessels, our minds like the sailors and passengers on these vessels.  Learning new things and recalling concepts are like taking on new passengers and taking a survey of their demographic.  It is the relatively direct and mechanical tasks of loading on new information and surveying what's in there.  However, changing the heart requires a deeper metamorphosis, because you are changing your personality and tendencies.  This concept is similar to changing the actual properties of the vessel.  It can happen through external circumstances, like barnacles and water damage eating away at the hull of the ship, or the ship colliding with dangerous obstacles in the sea.  And so it is with our hearts: our personalities are shaped by the hurtful things people do to us, or situations that we find ourselves in.  Change can also happen to the actual properties of vessels from the inside, like the sailors neglecting their duty to take care of the vessel, or the sailors adding improvements to different parts of the vessel.  And so it is with our hearts: we use the concepts we learn through philosophies, religions, psychiatrists, self-help books, etc. to mold our personalities.  So, that's where the dichotomoy/difference can be understood:  our hearts are the vessels, our memories the inhabitants.  Is the analogy making any sense?  Try the next one.  2)  For you fellow science heads, the difference is analogous to the difference between physical change of matter and chemical change of matter.  Physical changes of matter are more at a mechanical level: you can pulverize and chop the object, but the intrinsic properties of the matter are the same.  Chemical changes are at the fundemental level: you change the actual chemical makeup of matter when you burn something, when iron rusts, when you bake a cake.  What does this have to do with the mind and the heart?  The mind is more physical: it operates to store and compute data, it does things at a more mechanical, computational level.  The heart is more chemical: it is the essence of the person, it is more fundamental.  So, the mind can store all the data it wants, but that data doesn't necessarily reflect the fundamental essence of the person because it hasn't actually changed any personality.  A piece of paper 'remembers' you cutting it by staying cut, but it is still a piece of paper.  You can fix a bad memory by relearning material, just as you can fix that cut paper with tape.  Contrariwise, the heart can suffer extreme rejection and pain, but the mind cannot grasp why it cannot recover automatically.  A piece of paper is changed by a match's flame, and you can't tape it back together to restore it.  It would require you to change the chemical makeup of the ashes to restore the piece of paper.  Therefore, learning and knowing something in your mind differs from learning and knowing something in your heart because they have different inherent natures.  The first is more 'physical,' the second more 'chemical.'"], "gold_label": 0.0}

They mostly don't have a community view of the KDE project and they just see their own little application. This is sad. I feel I care about KDE as a whole, I enjoy building all modules and report small things I feel should be improved here and there. I also feel that even if I am not physically at aKademy, I can participate via IRC. The doc team is eager to take time to work with me so we can share new ideas and review what's been done so far. The usability team also is ready to think about what could be done and improving guidelines. It's hard to manage a module and I feel pretty alone in trying to foresee the kdeedu module future. Besides, having emails from users about porting 'this great (closed) program' does not help. Ususally, users want a KDE-matlab or scilab clone...

We went for dinner at Cassarino's in Providence and to Mohegan Sun Casino.  It was a good time had by all, but we all lost $$$. Even the non-social infamous by song title anyways Zdenek Janda and his wonderful wife went.  Please feel free to wish Erica a happy birthday by emailing her at eputis@comcast.net  Dave and I started to re-record the album again.  He finished 6 drums tracks and he has 5 more to do and then its onto the guitar and bass parts.  Then vocals and then we are done...haha so give us about 2 years before its done.  We have been coming up with some album names for the new record and we are going to choose 5 and then we will have you guys vote for the one you like best and the album name that has the most votes will be our album name. After the album is finished we are also going to get some tshirts and stickers made up so you the Predicatizens can be the few, the proud, the predicatizens!  On a side note-The Predicates will be attending the Ben Lee show at TT The Bears in Cambridge, MA on Wednesday June 16. You should attend it if you can.  Ben Lee is a singer-songwriter form the land down under Australia and he used to date Claire Danes.  He puts on a great show and he has terrific songs.

I think the reason I did not play well today is that many things were on my mind and I could not relax and focus on just hitting the ball...so I lost my first match to a girl that I placed above in the last tournament by much...and the girl that got first in today's tournament was a girl I beat in my first match last week...*sigh* but oh well...  So, afterwards, I called JoAnn (after I called Fifer of course....GET HOME SOOOOONNNN!) and she invited me to an outing with her, Naomi, and Bethany (the old group...we are not dead!!).  So we went to the mall and saw Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, something I had never even given a second thought about seeing...but they are all those kinda girly and hyper girls, so it is something they enjoyed...well, except for maybe Bethany, but that is just because she said it is not as 'realistic' as the first one (I was like, 'Um, the first one was...not exactly realistic itself...').  Anyway, it was fun.  Even though I am not as crazy and hyper as them, I kinda prefer it that way.  I gave a kind of sanity to the group.  Besides, some of it was immature in a way.  Not that I am judging them or anything, just explaining why I wasn't like them :).    We had some time to spare after we bought our tickets like an hour and a half early...so we went shopping a bit.  Now, I wanted to go to the book store, but apparently, all of my friends have decided never to go to the book store with me because I spend 'too much time in there.' and since I was outnumbered three-to-one, I had to go to Charlotte Russe with them and look at underwear...oh man, was this ever interesting.  Now, I don't want to get too personal here, or give more information than is wanted, but...gosh!  I don't understand how girls can wear thongs and feel comfortable!!!  Furthermore, they are made of an amount of cloth that is worth perhaps a nickel and they are $3-$6 a piece!!!  Is that not the craziest thing you have ever heard???  Heh, but in the end, after many 'Oh, this one reminds me of you, Lisa,' or 'Oh, you like these colors right?  AND it has a butterfly!!' I ended up being conned into buying two.  These people go out like every week and buy tons of them.  Craziness, I am telling you.  Well, after we got out of there, I was like, 'So on to the book store!!!!' which was inevitably met with a resounding, 'Noo!!'  I need to find some good nerdy friends :) :).  But, anyway, it was all great fun.  They make me laugh so hard, when I just observe them being crazy and hyper, and when I add in my own remarks that are so much in contrast to theirs that they just stare at me in unbelief...a good kind of unbelief, mind you.  And I laugh whenever JoAnn screams every time someone touches her neck, and when Naomi makes dirty jokes (Because I never thought she would!), and when me and Bethany argue about who is fatter.  Plus, JoAnn had Finch in her cd player (good screaming music :) ) and me and her head banged and screamed at the parts where they scream.  Bethany and Naomi didn't know the music, but it was all good, cuz they laughed at us.  Naomi and I talked more about what we are going to do with our dorm room...she read through the handbook and found out that street signs are banned at tams!!!  seriously!!! they have the weirdest rules...but our room will be the best by far.  Oh, and this morning I opened my own bank account!!!  Score, huh?  Well, I'm off.  Big day ahead of me.

I spent most of my time this week cleaning my little brother's room yes, it's THAT messy in order to set up a computer network from my mom and brother.  I have been unable to apply to jobs yet, though I set out to do that a month ago.  Man, this soul-searching stuff is hard.  I have gotten leads from some past references to possible places to apply, but nothing yet.  All you readers out there, take note: if you know anyone in the greater New York metro area looking for someone to work for them, please let me know.  I would mucho appreciate it.  Man, I need a haircut.  I've been unintentionally growing it out because I haven't really had a chance to go to a barber yet.\n\nText 2:I need something, or someone, to wake me up by grabbing me from the seat of my heart.  I want to  live , to live. TO LIVE.  Yet I wake late, and when I do, the day oozes by.  No real intelligent thought occurs until it's later at night and I realize what stupidness I've done, again.  Funny, how the fires of sober thought are stoked by the poker of regret.  ****  'Hmm... looking at your transcript, I don't think you should shoot so high when applying to grad schools.  Honestly, well, your grades suck.'  *uncomfortable silence, then a nervous laugh from me.*  'Oh, by the way, don't forget that I can always write a recommendation for you.'  *I smiled in disbelief.*  And so, during my senior year, went my final advising session with my horrible undergrad advisor.  For four years I had seen him once a semester, seven times in total.  Each time, the arrogance oozed out of his pores as he dismissed every question with the most deflating answers.  I remember the first session, I told him that I considered the field of prosthetics.  'Oh, well, that's not a very respectable field.  You shouldn't even bother thinking about it.  It's antiquated, and not very academic.'  Every semester, during our advising sessions, he'd look at my transcript, ask me what my activities were, flash his unctuous smile, and say, 'well, you'll just have to get those grades up.'  Right, right, and please tell me something I didn't know already.   Finally, I did, I made Dean's List first semester senior year.  On top of that, I was one of the few students to get an A in his class that semester.  And what did I hear?  'Your grades suck.'  HAHA. Oh, how rich.  The irony, the irony.  I'm smart, but I'm lazy.

Today a federal judge ruled a Virginia law passed last year (I think) outlawing the so called partial birth abortion procedure as unconstitutional.  I don't know the specifics of his ruling or what the law says, and that is not my question.  What I do not understand is under what situation is the pregnant woman's life in danger enough to end the pregnancy but not enough that it is 'safe' to undergo as much of the birth process as this does.  I use safe in quotes because nothing about the birthing process is without danger.  As much as doctors know, they still don't understand all the vagaries of child birth.  Please don't respond with a flame, because I have not desire to argue this issue, merely to have someone fill me in on something I may be missing about this particular procedure.\n\nText 2:17 Juni 2004  Blog..

It came down to some Intel MB drivers from Gigabyte. As I write, I am installing Halo PC. Maybe, just maybe, I will be able to run it on this machine.  With a good framerate.  Don't tell anyone, I may become the target of assasination.  I decided to reset my sleep schedule so I can actually get to bed at an hour that humans here normally do. To do so I embarked on a journey to completely screw my sleep pattern up. By staying awake all night, this I have accomplished. I may be kind of an asshole today. Ok, a really big asshole. But tonight I'm going to be tired. Tired like I haven't been in ages. And then I can go to bed.  Early.   I've been playing BFV, BF1942, C&C Generals, the Ground Control Demo, and the Joint Ops demo. If the graphics become particularly impressive I will hook you guys up with some screenshots. I think you'll get a few from Halo. I will be writing that Ground Control Demo review today as well.

What is your favorite magazine?  I've discussed this before...my guilty pleasure mag when I fly is US.  I adore it...and I have recently stopped hiding it because I don't care who knows that I LOVE celebrity gossip.  When I have to go the brain-fulfilling route, I would say I enjoy Smithsonian (loved the Frida article a few months back), Business 2.0 (esp. nice for a young-professional techie like myself), FastCompany (progressive business-speak), and Entrepreneur (to keep my dream of someday owning my own business alive).  For music, I can't get enough of Q Magazine, although, since it's imported from the UK, the price is high and you can't get the special attached CDs cuz they get lost when shipped over.   2. What is your favorite television station?  I be like Duf...no cable in my humble home.  So I must resort to the more mundane network and local stations.  I really like Public Television (channel 11) on a Saturday afternoon, esp. when they show the entire Anne of Green Gables series.  The WB is something I'm embarrassed to say I enjoy from time to time.  I'm missing the last episode ever of Dawson's Creek tonight, and I forgot to set my VCR, so I'm really bummed (I like me some Pacey, baby.)  Right after work I turn on UPN (channel 10) and watch Blind Date (makes me feel REALLY GOOD about my dating life), and then switch to Fox at 6:30 to watch Seinfeld.  Wow, this sounds like I'm anti-network, which is probably true.  Who in the hell could watch yet  another  episode of Fear Factor or Survivor anyway?  If I had cable, my favorite station would be TLC...hands down.  And maybe Lifetime for the Golden Girls reruns.  Don't get me started again about Bea Arthur."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I didn't even realize that the clock said 5:20 instead of 6:20 when I got up!!!  So I had a full hour of finishing my homework that I had not done.  Jennifer got here around 6:40 and I was ready obviously so I went outside to get into her car...and she informs me that no, we will not be going anywhere because she has accidentally locked her keys in her running car!  Wow, isn't this going to be fun.  So, instead of being late to school, I just went ahead and skipped first period.  We called a lock smith and waited 45 minutes for him to come and unlock her door, which took like 30 seconds, and she had to pay 45 dollars of her money that she had been saving up to buy a stereo for her car.  But such is life.  It was nice to miss first period...of course, I had missed it already yesterday for tennis and will be tomorrow for ready writing.  But oh well.  I got some more homework done during the time we were supposed to be in first.  What we also missed this morning was the mandatory TCC class meeting that we had to go to to take TCC courses next year for dual credit...so we had to go with all the Seniors during second period...so that was cool...we got out of algebra for 45 minutes.  History was normal...all we did was go over the two chapters...and lunch was funny cuz that one guy that Ialways write about put a Mr. peanut mask on his head and called me a retard...actually, he sat there and continually went, 'retard, retard, retard...'  ....um, yeah,....it was a bit funny if only a little immature...he is not my type of guy...but anyways...and then I watched Dunja and Nick play their tennis matches...and win them...they both got 3rd in district...that was some pretty amazing tennis I watched today...wow...anyways, sorry this isn't very interesting...I will have more to say some other time.

At lunch today, I was leaving Bruce and going to get an ice cream cone but they were all gone and then he came up behind me and was like, 'Tell me there are still some left!' and then I was like, 'No, I don't think there are.' and he looked and was like, 'Damn.  This ruins my day.' (it was amusing) and I was thinking, well, it just made mine...hahahahahahahahahaha.  ahem.  And so I was like, 'Maybe we should go ask for some more.' but then me and Sarah left and him and his friend left behind us....and that's it.    I know it might seem like I am obsessed because all my blogs lately have been about this, but it is the most interesting thing that goes on, and Sarah and I have many, many jokes about it (much like Fifer and I have jokes about journalism boy and turkey), so it gets discussed a lot.

ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Jeremy Kilpatrick.  It looks at the issue of state testing of math proficiency.  From the ERIC Digest:  In recent years many states have developed their own assessments of student learning in mathematics, usually aligned with state standards or curriculum frameworks. Many of these assessments are intended to have high stakes: financial or other consequences for districts, schools, teachers, or individual students. In some cases, teacher promotions or high school diplomas may depend on students achieving passing scores. As of 1998, 48 states and the District of Columbia had instituted testing programs, typically at grades 4, 8, and 11 (Council of Chief State School Officers, 1998).    Many states report the results of high-stakes assessments by school or by district to identify places most in need of improvement. State responses to assessment results vary. Some states have the authority to close, take over, or 'reconstitute' a failing school, but to date only a few states have ever used such sanctions (Jerald, Curran, & Boser, 1999). Florida awards additional funds to schools that perform near the bottom or near the top of the range (Sandham, 1999). When schools or districts with poor results do not show sufficiently rapid improvement, some states revoke accreditations, close the schools, seize control of the schools, or grant vouchers that enable students to enroll elsewhere.\n\nText 2:Guess who I saw at the Mandarin today....

I had brunch with the girls and watched Matrix 2 with some of them. It was cool for the whole gang to be back together.  Matrix was awesome. I didn't think it was confusing at all. There are little things that I had questions about, but they're minor sci-fi nerd questions. It was basically the all so common sci-fi question about destiny... are you meant to do what you're doing? or do you have choice? It's like the paradox of time travel. Are events of the present a result of you going back and making it happen? or would it have been different? It's kind of existential. Exactly how do you live your life? I read Sartre's 'No Exit' today and it addresses some of those issues. Is existence being able to make choices or not? Of course for Sartre it's making choices. Then again there's the ever so famous Marx quote that 'Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please.'  As Sartre says... 'Tu n'es rien d'autre que ta vie' - - 'You are nothing but your life.' As Merovingian says...

I don't remember what Philo's exact stance is, but I think it's agnosticsm.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have did the extra religious studies minor in addition to all the freaking degrees I have.

It was interesting, but I think the think I'd like to point out is that the professors' use of the word 'racism' might not be quite right. While it is perhaps a word similar to what ancient Asians might have used, it does not necessarily mean that the same sense of race existed back then as it does now. Indeed there was difference based on social location based on power, and identity; however, was it phenotypical or cultural / ideological / political? I'm not an expert on ancient, or even modern Asian history, so I don't know. I only know that racism as we know it today is a construct of capitalism and slavery.

Hey you know, when you talk politics day in and day out, and reading the paper is like some sort of sick obsession you just wonder about what other political movement do we have left?I just can't sit through CNN, I can't sit through TIME, I can see the god awful bias, the painted UNSAID WORDS and the fact that nothing is ever that blatant nor right/wrong.Time apparently is running out...you paranoid fucks! I can't believe you really believe that...after a hundred years of total fuckups, you think that your judgement day is coming any time soon? If there is going to be a judgement call its going to be destruction of ourselves by you know more human mistakes, like not admitting it. I was sitting with Kimberly on the steps of the Pavillion when she said that its harder to say sorry than to cause a fight about it. There you go, that's the godamn problem.I read everything and yet I can't stomach American media, its too red, blue and white.People just try to be too P.C and elitists and say; yeah you know do it for the greater good no matter how tough you are, it will be better in the long run. Are they too blind to see that controlling people and putting words in their mouths show a loss of faith in the human race? Let them stumble and revolt into a million mental diseases, let crime run wild in the land of the fee. Who gives a fuck about people? I care about ME, about what I want, I want to survive. But you are just people who answer to other people, its a chain of oppression and its so damn old. Why aren't you talking about the people who actually have to live under this system, like you! Politicians don't know what its like to live like this, they throw us a bone, cut some slack once in awhile and are godamn happy to know we are nicely sedated and confused about the whole godamn thing, they are above the law, they make and reinforce the laws, they get away with so much and people just catch and let go, like they are oiled eels. Why isn't the Republican party demolished? That fucking elephant has EXPIRED, let capitalism the way we know it know kiss the ground man...it's started to cramp spiritual freedom, as in..it's killing it one breath at a time, and the deep cynicism is poisoning the minds of too many true intellectuals. I'm sick of people putting each other down, like they have all the fucking answers. Its so delusional. Too many people have died and there are too many robots in this world, there is some sort of thread of enlightenment, somewhere right? Some people say to take a side is to be a realist. I don't care how articulate you sound, you are speaking to me like you know, I actually should support the ever expanding US Empire. That's what they mean, Take a side. The Right Side. Our Side. From Saudia Arabia; Shaykh Abd-al-Rahman al-Sudays, preacher and imam of the holy mosque in Mecca: 'We mustn't forget,' the imam says, 'that we are a nation of a pure faith and creed and a sublime world message and reminding people of it is the topic of this and every hour until the Day of Judgment.'  From America: George W Bush; State of the Union Address There can be no neutrality between justice and cruelty, between the innocent and the guilty. We are in a conflict between good and evil, and America will call evil by its name. (Applause.) By confronting evil and lawless regimes, we do not create a problem, we reveal a problem. And we will lead the world in opposing it. (Applause.)I rest my godamn case on top of the table where this political record is playing over...over...over...and over again.\n\nText 2:What do you do when it feels like your entire consciousness is within the confines of a relentless vise, restricting you from performing any constructive duty?

Anybody with a logical mind please enquire within.  My favourite part of music lessons has started! Sorry, did I say favourite? I meant my most hated dreaded I-really-don't-want-to-do-this part of music. Composition. Sounds easy? You just write lots of notes down, play 'em and then you're done, but there are several probelems. First of all, I can't sight read very well so when I have to play them back to myself, I can't remember what I did. Secondly, I can't read or write bass cleff, I can barely manage trebble cleff! Thirdly, I can't compose! I don't know what to do and what ever I write sounds like a monkey wrote it. This is the kind of point where I think to my self I don't want to spend 1/4th of my 6th form eduction on the flipping subject. I enjoy listening to music, and to some extent I enjoy playing it, but I hate composing and I hate learning about it. The fact the clarient wasn't around in the Baroque period isn't important information to me. I really don't need to know that serialsim sounds like me playing the piano with my arse, and I really do not need to know that a Sitar is a guitar from India without frets! I don't care! I really do not care! I don't want to know this information, please, no more! That is the end! No more ever please!   urlLink How do you mend a broken heart?

A mother skunk, a father skunk and two identical twin skunks named Inskunk and Outskunk. their parents named them as such because the only way to tell one fom the other was to keep inskunk inside all the time and Outskunk outside continually except at meal time. When being fed, Inskunk would be inside to eat and when done inskunk would go outside and Outskunk would come in to eat. After eating Outskunk would go back outside and Inskunk would come back in. They followed this ritual daily to avoid confusion. One day mother skunk had to go into town and left father skunk to look after the twins. As she was leaving she reminded him not to mix up the two because the last time it took them a week to sort it out. Father skunk replied, 'it is alright dear. I can tell them apart. So Off she went. When lunch time came father skunk let Outskunk in to eat without letting Inskunk outside. Mother came home to see this happen, I cannot believe you let this happen!' 'They are mixed up!!'

I may as well be in Buffalo THIS week ... 20-something degrees out every day.  UGH!!  Anyway ... here's a cool 'human interest' story.  It snowed overnight on Thursday into Friday, and again on Friday into Saturday.  Now, I have two cars ... an SUV that I take on road trips and when the weather is bad, and a little, incredibly gas efficient hatchback that I love to drive around town and for normal commuting.  So ... when I got up to go to my rehearsal on Saturday morning, I scraped the ice and snow off of my SUV and took off at about 8:00.  After the rehearsal and several errands later, I arrived back home around 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon.  As I drove through my parking lot, I noticed that all of the cars that had not been moved since before the snow hit were still quite covered.  So, as I pulled into my parking lot section, I looked for my little blue hatchback under a pile of snow.  GET THIS PART!!  Someone had not only brushed the snow off of my car, but had scraped the windows bone clean.  I was amazed!!  There were lots of other cars that needed cleaning, but some kind soul did mine.  I have absolutely NO IDEA who it was.  The likely culprits (a wonderful upstairs neighbor couple) insisted that they didn't do it, and I don't really know anyone else around here.  I can't imagine who ... so, in lieu of thanking him/her, I am putting this in my blog so that you can get a good idea about maybe doing the same sort of anonymous favor for someone else!!  :-)  Go for it!!  By the way ... our Substitute Teacher Assignment Network at school is named S.T.A.N.  (get it ... SSSSubstitute TTTTeacher AAAAssignment NNNNetwork!!??)  There was a huge piece of paper on my front seat that I put there as a reminder.  It said, 'Call STAN!!!' in big letters.  Whoever it was that was cleaning my car could NOT have missed seeing that piece of paper.  They must be thinking now that I have a wonderful man in my life named STAN.  LOL!!  I assure you that I don't!!  HAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nText 2:Alright, it's that time of year again. That's right.  It's Big Brother time.  Now some of you may know that a few years back I was completely and utterly obsessed with recapping the live feeds.  Last year, the love was lost.  This year, I'm completely undecided on.  The cast seems a little less loath-worthy this season (as you may know, last season there was no more than two likeable people, and I think they were only likeable by default--surround yourself with the cruddiest people on the planet and you will come out smelling like a rose, even if you are a complete nutjob).    And this year I may actually have time to recap, and DSL to keep my computer from attempting to blow right up (dial up and recapping makes for a whole damn lot of work).  But will my new place be set up to accommodate that kind of recapping?  I don't know yet.  I moved my bed and closet-items over this morning (with kind help from a passing through stranger--okay, it wasn't a stranger, but he just happened to be headed up to Minneapolis and stopped here on the way (which is completely out of the way) and helped little ole' me with the pre-move move.  Thanks Travis.  You MUST return to get your reward for your humanitarian efforts.  Or some food or beer or something).  The rest will be moved sometime at the end of this weekend or next week sometime.  I plan on hitting an Independence Day sale at McGregor's to get a new desk for my computer (not that I can move the computer until the parents' new one gets here).  We remember the flood damage, right?  The problem comes in when I note that I only have two televisions and one will go in the living room while the other will go in my bedroom.  This leaves no background noise for the recapping.  I have to have background noise while recapping, otherwise I just lose my will to bother.  I also have no more stereos to hook up anywhere but in the living room (with the television and the surround sound audio), and the newly decided upon fitness room (where it is just a mini-stereo).  I could move that from one room to the other whenever I need to, but that's just a lot of prep to sit down and recap and we all know I don't like a lot of prep-work for much of anything.  I lose interest.  Anyway, I have no idea just how much I want to recap anyway.  Not to be all up on myself, but I posted once on that board already and one of the mods was almost up my ass begging me to recap.  I know I won't have the same dedication I had to it two seasons ago (where obsessed with it might be considered the understatement of the millennium).  Mostly because I really enjoy that whole sleep thing these days, not that I get a lot of it lately, but I do enjoy what comes my way.  And then the second or third week of the show, I'm probably going to Sacramento for a few days.  And then to wherever I want to go toward the end of the summer.  I have no idea.  So, I guess I may or may not recap depending on a variety of things.  Anyway, I mentioned the new set up of the new house.  I decided to utilize all of the four bedrooms (why close them off and let the spiders have them, right?).  I am using one as my bedroom (obviously--and I'm using the largest with the 3/4 bath attached).  One will be the office (with my former living room furniture and computer desk and other office-related things).  The third bedroom will be my at-home gym.  I'm taking the exercise equipment that has been stored in the garage since about a week after it was purchased (I'm guessing 12 years ago) and instead of going in search of a work-out facility, am creating my own.  We have a bowflex and free weights and the like, so why not use them, right?  The fourth bedroom will be the guest bedroom.  I'm taking my old twin bed and setting it up in there (the bed has been in storage since I went to college) and my old bedroom furniture to go with it (who doesn't like white veneer furniture?  I don't, but it works for that, I suppose).  So that almost fills the house.  I guess I have more at my fingertips here than I thought I did (it helps muchly that I'm getting the old living room furniture from the parents).  I'm so excited about it that I can barely stand it.  Now who wants to help me with the big furniture?  You know you do.  There's not even any packing involved.  The rest has been boxed up for--well--since I moved last time.  Easy as pie.  And maybe you'll get some of that pie if you help me move.  Please.  Please please please?!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

I think we are all allotted a maximum quantity of things in our life.  We walk around everyday with a riding-a-bus threshold, a chick-flick ceiling, and a visit-to-the-mall cap.  Everyone's threshold is different.  For example, DJS's mayonnaise threshold is comically low, while my french fry limit is almost inexhaustible.  My mother will not eat a hot dog, no matter what - she had to live on them when she was a poor college student, and she maxed out.  Anyway, during my college years, I reached my Violent Femmes limit.  I simply cannot hear 'Blister in the Sun' again (although, it must be written that 'American Music' is among the worst songs of all time - it ranks with 'H.W.C.' as being almost as bad as 'Paradise by the Dashboard Lights').  I have heard it 100,000 times already.  It's not that I dislike the Violent Femmes, I'm sure they are just fine.  It's more that I am past my limit with them.    You never know when you are going to max out.  It just happens.  I hit my VF limit in 1987.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  It happened on March 15th at 10:17 a.m.  I was late for my Current American Foreign Policy class, and I was drunk.  My roommate Todd (late for his Comparative Lit class and stoned) took off my slightly warped LP of The Smiths' 'Meat is Murder' and put on the Violent Femmes.  'Gone Daddy Gone' was spinning on our turn table, and I realized I was done.  I couldn't listen anymore.  I'd maxed out.   Historical note:  For you younger Pandylanders a turn table is a machine that is used to play LPs (a.k.a. records).  You see, before .WAV or the MP3 and before the mini disc, in fact, before the compact disc or the cassette tape, there was a music playing device called a record player.  People used it to play records.  You might have seen it at a club where a DJ is 'spinnin' and winnin'.'  Anyway, Duf the dinosaur actually had a record player in college.  As a side note, he graduated never having used a computer.  That's right all of his papers were written on a typewriter, and he used the shit out of white out."], "gold_label": 1.0}

This head was called 'kharchi-e-paandaan' (betel box expense)! K established a trust for this purpose but did not pay H regularly after her marriage to K's son. Consequently, H sued for recovering arrears of Rs. 15,000 from K. K contended that the contract was between him and H's father. H was not a party to the contract and hence could not sue. The case went to the Privy Council in England and the Council decided that since a trust was set up with H being a beneficiary, H could indeed sue for recovering benefits in arrears. A most extraordinary case, or, in Sherlock Holmes' words, 'a most singular case'... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case was cited to note&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;exceptions to the general law that 'a stranger to a contract cannot sue for damages in case of breach of contract'. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"], "gold_label": 0.0}

There's this weird deal, for this week and the next, that they're giving out 6000 free minutes for nights and weekends, to be used for the next six months if you get it online.  Phone:  urlLink LG 1010   Something I was thinking about today.  Maybe it's a waste of thought, but I was wondering, how can one describe the feeling of liking or 'falling in love' with someone?  How does one qualitatively describe the feeling?  It's easy to describe other emotions, like happiness.  Happiness is the state where one thinks and has positive feelings, is it not?  But when you like someone, there's this one specific feeling that I just can't find a way to put into words.  I feel it in my chest; maybe I can say it's like muted excitement.  It includes an overwhelming sense of longing to be with the person in question; there's that really strong sense of adoration for the person, regardless of perceived imperfections.  I wish I can say the word 'longing' would be another way to put it, but there's still more to it.  Maybe it can be described as this:  romantic feelings are when you feel pleasure, excitement, desire, concern, and the rest of your emotions in response to the person in question.  I have no idea why I was thinking about this, besides the fact that I'm a very emotional/sentimental type of person.  Too much so, in which I find myself rendered stupid when overcome by them.  Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.  How can we humans feel the same way about God?  About Someone we can't perceive with our physical senses?  Yet, God desires that for us.  How can I feel pleasure, excitement, desire, longing for God, in the same and even in a more intense manner than I do with romantic interests?\n\nText 2:urlLink Battle Creek Yankees - News   Another former battery-mate making it big!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

I can't even handle being alone with myself. It seems to me, I need to spend some time alone. Or at most, just hanging out with guys not even thinking about girls. That would seem like the only logical thing to do, especially if I don't want a rebound relationship. I think it would be best to heal. I mean honestly, I feel as though I should be alone for a while. I don't want to be one of those people that NEEDS to be in a relationship. I want to be the kind of person that if a relationship comes along I can be like, sure, but not strangle it.   It's like I would really like to be in love with somebody, but I don't want to just be in love with anybody. Does that make any sense? AKA, I would like to have someone to love, but it DOES make a difference on who that person is. I'm not just going to want to be in a relationship with any ol' girl.

What this site does is trade currency between online communities, worlds, and games.  In this blog, I will mention those terms often, and it's important that I define them as such.  An online community is a group of individuals interacting inside of a predominantly social environment.  An online world is similar, but with less focus on social interaction and more focus on creativity or development.  An online game is something along the lines of a MMORPG, where the focus is on skilling a character by hunting, clanning, or crafting.  Collectively, and generically, I'll refer to them as metaverses, which are defined in many places as  urlLink virtual online representations of reality.   Although I find that GOM provided an exceptionally intriguing service, it was, at least partially, illegal.  Although There, Inc. and Second Life do allow third party transfers of their in-world currency, the vast majority of online metaverses do not allow this.  Lineage 2 (L2), a new release from NCSoft is struggling with this issue in the game's infancy.  Such prohibitive language can be seen in Paragraph 7 of Lineage 2's  urlLink Agreement of Use .  Although one could argue that this does not mean players cannot sell/trade 'Adena' (L2's in-game monetary unit), the developers construe it as such and are enforcing it.  In a thread on the official L2 forums,NCSoft's DhevrinNC makes a post (3rd down) that is directly  urlLink on point .    These companies invest hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars of capital into creating these online metaverses.  The environments they create generally consist of their own intellectual property.  This is, of course, changing with the introduction of There and Second Life, but those companies have been remarkably open with their property rights.  Traditional gaming corporations are much less likely to be as giving.  From my lay perspective, it appears as though they see any profit being made by third parties as money being taken out of their pockets.  It is arguable as to whether this belief is based in fact.    Prohibitions, construed from intellectual property law, to prevent those third parties from financial gain are why places like GOM will be unable to function for the foreseeable future.  Even There will not assist with currency exchange issues between third parties.  Second Life's Linden Lab has been much more accommodating, but it seems as though Linden is willing to venture into the forefront of digital property rights experimentation; often to a point even I would find uncomfortable.  This is an unfortunate response, although it is understandable.  The parent corporation does possess a valid intellectual property right in the in-game money and items that one earns or purchases.  Developers such as Sony and EA have always exhibited strong protectionist leanings.    One might argue that because a player earns these items or currencies, the player has a vested property right in them.  However, usage agreements explicitly state that the world exists under the supreme rule of the developers and the player contracts away any possessory rights before even setting foot in the metaverse.  Until litigated, these contracts stand as enforceable.  Conscionability may be arguable, but, for now, these worlds do belong to the developers.  If you distribute their intellectual property outside of the scope and terms of use allotted, not only are you taking that value into your own hands, but you are infringing on their rights in a method that may be actionable.  --DW"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Part I. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Jeanne Bleuerand Garry Walz.  It shows how boys are being ignored at the expense of girls.  From the ERIC Digest:  For many years, gender equity has pertained primarily to improving education and career opportunities for females. In a highly controversial report published by the American Association of University Women, How Schools Shortchange Girls (AAUW, 1992), researchers presented evidence that girls were not receiving the same quality or even quantity of education as boys.    Recent studies, however, provide evidence that boys no longer hold the advantage. As Diane Ravitch, former Director of the U.S. Department of Education Office of Educational Research and Improvement, stated in Sommers (2000, p.22), 'The AAUW report [How Schools Shortchange Girls] was just completely wrong. What was so bizarre is that it came out right at the time that girls had just overtaken boys in almost every area. It might have been the right story 20 years earlier, but coming out when it did it was like calling a wedding a funeral... There were all these special programs put in place for girls, and no one paid any attention to boys.'\n\nText 2:urlLink Teaching about the Life and Health of Cells. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury.  From the ERIC Digest:  The cell is 'the ultimate irreducible form of every living element, and...from it emanate all the activities of life both in health and in sickness.' Rudolph Ludwig Carl Virchow (1858, translated 1860)  We've learned a lot about living cells since Robert Hooke (1665) viewed cork through a crude microscope and likened the hollow chambers to the cells of a monastery. Now we know that living cells are dynamic micro-environments, complete with microtubule transport networks and protein motors (see  urlLink http://www.hhmi.org/news/vale.html ). With the development of cell theory in 1839 (Mazzarello, 1999), Biology became a theoretical science, and with the publication of 'Die Cellularpathologie' (Virchow, 1858), modern clinical medicine gained a scientific foundation. Since then, good health came to be viewed as an outward expression of healthy cells, with disease arising from the cells of a tissue. Now, modern biotechnology is moving us along previously unimagined avenues to health that involve the use of undifferentiated cells (stem cells) in developing cell therapies, replacing diseased or dysfunctional cells with new, functioning cells. Biologists' understanding of cells has been greatly enriched in recent decades (Flannery, 1999). Though a long established field of study, cell biology has been transformed from the study of microscopic curiosities to a theory-based study of life itself, and now to a powerful new tool for creating health by marshalling the body's own life forces. It seems time for the study of cells in school biology to become transformed as well."], "gold_label": 1.0}

This is called your FICO&trade; Score. (FICO&trade; is named after the company who made credit scores popular, Fair Isaac Corp.)  FICO scores range from 300 - 900. In reality, credit companies give everyone a starting score of 850, and deduct points based on their credit history. Of course, it is more complicated than that, but essentially that's how it works.    My FICO Score   I purchased my credit report today (08-06-2004), and found out my FICO score is 704. Now 750 is considered median, in that half the population have scores under that amount and half are over.  So what this means is I have  slightly  below-average credit. This is causing me some concern right now, and is the primary reason I started this blog. I suspect that it will not be too difficult, mostly through personal education, to raise that score above the 750 mark.  The nice thing about the credit report is that it breaks tells you the top 4 primary factors affecting your FICO number. According to today's report, mine are:   1. The amount owed on credit cards and loans is too high  I already knew this. I have a lot of debt. It wasn't always like this, but I will get into the reasons why it happened another time.   2. The proportion of balances to credit limits on credit cards and loans is too high  I don't quite understand this aspect of FICO, and will spend time learning more about it. In theory, if you have a $10,000 credit limit and you have a $7,500 outstanding balance, you have a 75% debt-to-credit-limit ratio. My ratio is currently 66% - but I am getting dinged for this number being too high.   3. The proportion of balances to credit limits on credit cards is too high  Same as above.   4. Relatively high number of accounts with balances.  This means I have too many loans and credit cards. But because this is the fourth item on the list, it is the one least affecting my score.  In coming blog entries, I will explore ways to improve each of those four areas. Then I will check my credit score again in a couple of months to see if there is any improvement."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I ask, not because I actually think the frozen food aisle here in the grocery store is a train station, or that I think you, the stock boy, are the engineer or something - but I think it's a good way to start conversation. I mean, I ask you if that display of cap'n crunch is a train, you go 'eh?' and then I can go off on a tangent, about how I read on this website about a bunch of people who want to get the cap'n promoted to admiral for some reason. I mean, I wouldn't promote him. I personally know the cap'n, and his place is on his big cartoon boat, not commanding some fleet of cereal-based warships, bound for milkitania, to overthrow the despot ruling it and to free the people, not, as some people think, to let the cartoon cereal mascots have easy access to that country's great stores of milk. I know we already conquered spoonland, and now spoons are cheap and plentiful here, and the new country, The United States Spoonland Federated Territories, is the geographical equivalent of a steaming pile of alpaca manure, only with less nutrients - but at least they are free from the terrible state-enforced free healthcare, education, and utilities. You know, while we're talking about cereal, don't you miss boo-berry crunch? I mean, it was the most godawful tasting bile of a cereal, but it turned your milk *blue*. Anything that makes milk blue without also making it poison is a gift from the gods. Also, I think stuff that makes milk blue *and* poison is a gift from the gods, but I probably worship the wrong gods. I invented my gods. I'm the only person who worships my gods, who mostly deal in turning things different colors. I think my religious system stems from the spiritual experience I had at the crayola factory. See, when I was young, My school went on a tour of the crayola crayon factory, and I got to see all the neat crayons and stuff, but then - They gave me a box of crayons! For free, without me doing anything spectacular or noteworthy. I mean, this guy just walked up and gave me a whole box of my very own crayons. I was so happy I went home and drew gods on the walls of my room with the crayons. Each color was a different god. I have 8. The blue god changes things into blue, but sometimes he also makes them poison. I think he's the bad one. Him and white. That white god hardly does anything, unless I leave like, pudding or something in my fridge for a couple months, then it turns white. But when the white god turns stuff white, it almost always smells real bad and tastes kinda funny. I can't usually remember what it tastes like, but I know the people in the hospital also wear white, which I think the white crayon god makes them do to freak me out. Oh, hey, so if you're the stock boy, and I wanted, say, shark fin, could you go out and catch a shark and defin it for me? Because I want my shark fin to be really really fresh. I make fermented shark fin soup from it. Hey, where are you going?"], "gold_label": 1.0}

So, to those who don't know: yes, you can. You don't have to be stuck with the generic icons your Mac came with. The ability to change the icons of, well, pretty much anything on your Mac that has an icon is one of the great pleasures of owning a Mac. Here's how to do it:   Step 1: Get some icons  Excellent icons abound for the Mac, the advantage of being the platform used by the best artists in the world I suppose. Download and unstuff icons from any of these places:  urlLink Icon Factory  - icons at their best  urlLink Apple's Icons & Screensavers  section  urlLink Xicons.com   urlLink Icon Master    Step 2: Applying the icon  Once you've downloaded and unstuffed the icons select the icon you want to use and Get Info (Cmd-I) on the selected icon file. You'll see the Info window appear and in the upper-left corner of that window, a small representation of the icon. Select the icon in the Info window and Copy (Cmd-C) it.  Now select the file or folder you want to apply the icon to and Get Info (Cmd-I) on it. Again you'll see the icon in the upper-left corner of that window.  Select the icon in the Info window and Paste (Cmd-V) the icon you already copied (its now stored on the clipboard) onto it.  If everything went properly you'll have copied the icon from the icon file to your file or folder. C'est tout.  urlLink Discuss\n\nText 2:To all the developers out there writing the kick-ass software that makes OS X the techno-orgiastic playground its become, and to all the fine folks inside Apple laying the groundwork: thank you!

Every night when I go to my cupboard looking for something to eat... a packet of Easy Mac falls to the counter and teases me with its potential cheesy goodness. But, I don't eat it because of all the Thiamin.   Last night I had to eat something quick to get to the bar in time to catch the end of the Pistons game. Pistons won... and I had to make something 'easy'. Some food I could 'mac' on. Some Easy Mac. I was excited. I was going to eat the Easy Mac.   I opened my cupboard in anticipation waiting for it to fall down to the counter, yet tonight... it stayed put. It sat there and taunted me like a little bitch. A little bitch I would devour.   I snatched it out, emptied the crusty noodle into a bowl, splashed some water in, and nuked. As I kept my face pressed against the leaky microwave I caught a glimpse of the noodle wrapper. I saw what I thought was the serial number and started thinking to myself what a huge dork would understand what that shit actually meant. I mean honestly, how boring of a person would that have to...  BEEP!  I emptied the cheesey pack into the bowl and stirred. It wouldn't be long now. A cloud of cheese powder floated into the air with the toxicity of what I could only guess was that of asbestos. I took my first bite. It didn't taste like easy mac at all. It tasted like Satan.   I ate three more chomps wondering if maybe I just hadn't had the shit in so long my body needed to build up a tolerance. The third bite kind of sat in between my lungs. Almost like there was some sort of problem down below...   I waited for my food tube to push the easy mac down yonder and started looking at the serial number again. Maybe I could decipher it...   'EXPMAR01'   Hmmmm... before I could let the realization of my own stupidity sink in, it felt like I'd been shot in the stomach. I keeled over and stared at my trash can for a couple seconds and as quickly as it came, it went away.   I got up, threw away the easy mac, and ate a sandwich.   The next day I was at the Secretary of State renewing my licesnse plate. I'd taken my number and was sitting in the row of chairs that face the wall, when a little thimble of gas arrived to my rectum. It was a minor disconfort and I was sure nothing would come of it. I put my arm over the chair next to me, lifted my right cheek as I acted like I was looking behind me, and released.   pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffsssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  I hadn't noticed but a small black kid was curled up behind my chair, I had probably just killed half his brain cells. I soon realized that was the least of my worries. I could watch the smell move through the room as people one by one became extremely uncomfortable. I finally smelled it, it smelled like death.   My number was called. I sat motionless deciding on my next move. Would I sit and wait for the smell to leave and then get another number? Or would I give away the culprit. There was no was I was about to sit here for another hour in this room, besides it smelled like shit now.   I walked through the aisles and approached the counter. As I walked through the aisles I heard comments behind me.   'Oh for Christ's sake...'  'Damn, that boy needs a Doctor!'  That one got people laughing.  'Yes, I need to renew my plates.'   'Ok sir...' she looked at me with a skeptical look, 'here's a pass to leave and come back, you won't even have to wait in line. Go out that door, use the bathroom NEXTDOOR, and come back after you've made sure that won't happen again.'  'Yes maam,' I'd just gotten a Federal pass because of my ass.   As I walked out I saw the little black kid's eyes roll into the back of his head. He fell over and the mother exploded in agony...   'naw NAW NAAAAWWW!!! MUH BABY BOY!' she turned to look at me, 'you did this, cracka!'   'No maam, Thiamin did this. Thiamin.'\n\nText 2:late night update:  won about $20 playing late night to offset some weekend losses.  i'm down about $8 as we speak.  maybe tomorrow i'll get bak onto the happy side of par"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Caller ID told me it was the school.  The voice on the other end asked if I was me.  'Yes it is.'  'Do you know who this is?' she said with assurance.  'Yes.  It's Nurse F,' I replied.  'So how sick is she?'  Yep, R is sick again with the same thing I have, it seems.  Apparently, her immune system is on furlough.  I can only hope it returns sometime soon, hopefully before next year when it's not 'just first grade'.  And my child is not an easy, oh I'll just lay down and rest and watch TV kind of kid.  She's the dramatic, cry out at random, cover her mouth every time until she's on my lap kind of kid.  lol.  But, she's my baby and I just want her to be well.  So I'll sit with her, give her medicine and plenty of liquids (on a miserably hot day like today - a whopping 87 degrees record - I'll give her lots of pedialite pops from the freezer) and read to her, play quietly with her and tell her that no, even though she is sick, it is not an open door on whining or sassing!  She came home with homework and I made her do it right away and there is no school tomorrow, so we're set for the weekend.  Daddy is off to school and then work tonight, but he'll be home tomorrow to give me a break (after he has a nap) if I'm ready to run into the streets screaming 'sanctuary' - lol.  And if she's worse tomorrow, we'll see the Dr.  I, on the other hand, was feeling better.  It seemed by infection was resolving itself.  But now it's back and forth so I suspect I will ultimately end up at the Dr.'s for my own TLC, too.  Of course, it's in my lungs causing my asthma to flare up.  I really get frustrated with that, too.  Yuck.  And my baby has it, too.  It stinks!  On a brighter note, for there always is one, I have finally completed making my first leather book cover for my dad for a gift.  It was actually due in Feb - lol.  But, with school and my own family, I simply had no time.  It's done today, though, and I'll mail it off tomorrow to him.  He uses it almost like a purse - lol.  Everything he needs to take with him goes inside it - checkbook, notes, directions, Dr. appointment info, etc.  So he wears them out about every year and I've made them from that plastic mesh stuff and yarn previously.  But I hope the leather will last more than a year as regular material didn't even make it a full year.  He is a man who always reads books, so it gets LOTS of use.  He is the one that instilled the love of books in his kids.  Well, one of my brothers doesn't read much, but all the rest of us do.  Especially all 3 of we girls.  Which causes me to recall a wonderful series of books by Jan Karon - The Mitford Series.  If you enjoy reading and appreciate what I call 'good books' - meaning not filled with filth - you will love them.  Right now I'm reading an interesting book called The Stone Diaries.  I'm about 1/2 way through and I've quite enjoyed it so far.    I finally got some groceries in the house.  Our cupboards had become bare!  I got all good, healthy, cool to eat foods - fruits, veggies, 100% whole wheat bread for sandwiches, etc.  Tomorrow, we go to the grocery store where we DON'T buy any produce because it's terrible there but everything else is cheaper.  Then we'll get everything else we need.  I'm working hard to only shop once a month or so.    For Mother's Day, I asked J to grill some steaks I've had in the freezer for about 2 months!  Our money is tight, so I'm perfectly happy with dinner here as long as he does ALL the prep and cooking and finishes up the dishes.  He's game, so I'm happy.  R made me at least 4 things for Mother's Day, too.  It's my favorite holiday because I waited so long to be a mother and R has been such a great joy in my life.  It was a day that used to be a very sad one for me.  Not having felt my childhood to be a very good one, it hasn't been one that I got excited about.  Then, I had R and my life changed for the better and I came to know what is meant by unconditional love for someone - that is what R has from me.  And, I'm beginning to strongly believe, it's what J has from me, too.  It feels good to be able to give that kind of love to someone.    Well, I might pop in here for another post tonight - or not - lol.  I'm enjoying having the time to post whenever the mood strikes me.  To be a writer for a living - now that would be my dream!  Too bad it's not very realistic - lol.\n\nText 2:Heh.  I work at home, so who really cares about 9 to 5.  Just no weekends, please!    R watches a show called Kim Possible about a teenage....secret agent, I guess is what she is.  Anyway, she has this pal, Ron Stoppable, who has a Naked Mole Rat for a pet named Rufus.  Now they do this song about Rufus, who is like a super cool critter, that goes like this: Hey! What's that? What's that freaky thing?  A Naked Mole Rat! So every time I hear or read 'What's That?' I think of that darn song.  Don't you hate when that happens?!?!  lol.  I had work yesterday and I'm happy to say that it went a little quicker then usual.  I was glad of that.  I didn't have any today and my boss is checking to see if he has something for me for in the morning when she runs by his office tonight.  I like doing these transcriptions because they are pretty wordy and the more words, the more money.  But I think I'll only be working about 3 days a week over the summer - which is perfect.  Come time for R to be back in school and I'll want to be full time.  But for now, this is okay.  My other issue is while listening and transcribing, I can feel the insurance adjuster coming out in me.  It's really pretty awful because I often roll my eyes at the new 'complaints' a patient has.  But I know that comes from handling claims and there being so much fraud in that line of work.  If you're an honest person (which I know my pals reading this are!), you don't really think that way.  But you'd be very surprised how many people do.  Even people you don't expect it from.  I had a very bad attitude about people in general when I left that job.  It used to drive J crazy because I just didn't have a lot of faith in the goodness of people, so I didn't trust them very much.    Okay, here's one story about a claim that surprised me - by the dishonesty and stupidity of the insured.  We got a call from an elderly man who said he'd been robbed, had called the police and then was told by a neighbor 8 months later that he should file a claim with his insurance.  I took his recorded statement.  He knew he was being recorded, so he knew any lies would be on record.  He proceeded to tell me how he'd been out and it was snowing, a light dusting on the ground.  When he came home, he noticed he'd been robbed.  He called the police right away and they took a report and investigated.  This happened, according to him, on January 2 of whatever year that was.  I asked what was missing and he began to give me a long list.  He said he was a singer back in his younger days and they stole all his rhinestone western outfits - of which he provided xeroxed photos - his instruments, of which he sent photos of two but said there were 5, etc.  Then he said they took his TV, stereo (okay, this is more believable), microwave, pots and pans, china, sofa, 5 guns of various type, even his underwear!  That's right.  His underwear.  Okay, you can probably see this is pretty far out there and had I not stopped him, who knows where it would have gone.  I asked him if there was evidence of a truck pulling up to his residence because that's what it would take to steal all that unless it was a large group.  What theif would steal clothing?  Maybe a woman taking an expensive gown.  But a guy taking mens clothing????  And underwear????  I don't think so.  Nor pots and pans.  Or china, unless is was a special, expensive set - but this old man was living in a little trailer, as I recall.  Well, the police report came in two weeks later and, low and behold, there was one set of tracks leaving the house (meaning one guy) which the police followed and caught the one theif who had only stolen a shotgun.  And the icing on the cake, it actually happened in December, 2 days before we had a policy with him.  When I called him, he was mad, said the police were lieing, the date was wrong, etc.  I called his previous carrier and warned them because he said he was going to file with them and why let someone like that waste other's time and effort to investigate?  Even sent them a copy of the police report.  Since there was no damage and everything - the gun - was recovered, there was no claim.  That was a very typical situation, just variations in the insured or claimants level of intelligence.  Pretty sad statement if you ask me.  I'm popped.  I'm gonna take a nap.  Probably write more tonight."], "gold_label": 1.0}

In fact the only person I've ever hit out of anger was my ex-husband, 2 days before I married him.  Should have taken that as a warning.  Anyway, this morning my eye is twitching (a newly developed stress-related twitch) and I am completely on edge.  The thought occurred to me this morning on the way to work that I understand how parents can beat their children.  Not that I condone it or would ever hit my children, but out of sheer exasperation and frustration, I see how it happens.    I wanted to tear wings off flies or kick a dog or something.  Wanted to yell at my children to hurry up and blast my car horn at every driver in my way while I sped down the highway at 70mph this morning.  Some horrible seed of anger has sprouted in me this morning and I don't know why.  And I don't feel sad or anxious.  Actually I feel pretty good today.  And now that I'm at work, I'm calmer.  The room is quiet, my coffee is good and the oatmeal is hot.  It seems to have passed, for now...  Diva out.\n\nText 2:Someday soon, I've got a pretty meaty post to write about my own personal politics and the current Presidential campaign. That one is still brewing up in my mind. In the meantime, I offer yet another selection of assorted thoughts and notes.   Our company president has been missing in action so far this week. This matters mostly because our staff has been cut and reallocated so that he's essentially our only salesman, at least for capital equipment. Our head engineer has been dealing with sales calls in his absence, and that has actually probably worked out better. The only problem with this is that our head engineer is leaving at noon and won't be back for two days. Of course, our sales haven't been so hot lately anyway, but we have had a lot of inquiries. Should anyone want to turn an inquiry into an order over the course of the next two days, I think they're going to be out of luck. This seems like a fine way to run a business.   Today I'm finally going to get around to putting the electricity for our new apartment into my name. Somehow, in all the rush of actually getting everything moved, I've skipped this little detail. The electricity is still on, but I think it's currently being billed to the landlord. That probably shouldn't continue any longer than is absolutely necessary. On the flip side of that, a new tenant moved into my old place yesterday, and his electrical usage is currently being billed to me. So I guess it works out.   One thing that wasn't so bad about my tire experience yesterday is that the time I spent waiting to get the tire fixed was time I was able to spend reading  The Winds of War . I started reading it on July 15 and I'm just now about 1/3 of the way through it. I read quickly, but I'm only reading this one on my lunch break or whenever I find myself stuck somewhere with some time to kill. It is a superb piece of historical fiction. I'm in awe of it, actually. I've always been fascinated by World War II anyway, and Wouk has really crafted an interesting work by spinning a tale set in that period and really integrating historical fact into the story. It'll be a while before I'm finished with it, but I'm sure I'll dive immediately into the follow-up novel  War and Remembrance .   I'm also still working on  Song of Susannah , which I started even earlier than I did the Wouk novel. I said at the time that I planned to take my time with it, and apparently I was serious about it. I haven't had much time to read that one lately due to moving anyway, but I'll probably dive back into it pretty soon now that things are settling back down. I'm fairly close to the end. The next and final book in the  Dark Tower  series comes out on September 21, and I'll definitely be ready by then.   I know I said yesterday I would post some pictures from the Kerry/Edwards rally, and I haven't done that. As it turns out, I was so far away that Mr. Kerry is just a blue blur in the photos I took. I was hoping they would come out better, but unfortunately my camera doesn't have an optical zoom, and its digital zoom is nearly worthless. This is one event I definitely would love to have had a better camera for. At any rate, I may post some photos later anyway, just to show how packed downtown Bowling Green was on Sunday. It was utterly unbelievable.   Speaking of photos, I'd really like to take an afternoon to walk around the BGSU campus to take some shots to post on here. I'm sure I'll spend my share of time by the athletic facilities (Anderson Arena and Doyt Perry Stadium, at least), but there are some other spots on campus that I really like as well. Maybe I'll put that on my agenda for this weekend, if the weather cooperates.   I heard a radio commercial this morning featuring spokeswoman  urlLink Pam Dawber . Wow, really? Pam Dawber? I had totally forgotten she ever existed, and I'm probably not the only one. She seems like an odd choice for current advertising, to say the least. I was so stunned to hear her name, I couldn't even tell you what she was trying to sell me.    The Reds are on TV late this evening (they're playing in San Francisco), and as dreadful as they've been lately, I'm sure I'll probably watch.  They have to come out of their slide at some point, right?  Ken Griffey Jr. is supposed to be back from injury perhaps as soon as tonight, so that will help.    Another item I want to catch on television this evening is President Clinton's appearance on Letterman.  That'll overlap some with the baseball game, but that's fine.  I really enjoy hearing Clinton speak, and I also like Letterman a lot.  Having both of them together should be great.  I read something yesterday that said Mr. Clinton has been asked to host  Saturday Night Live  at some point.  I hope he does it."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I can't wait to buy my first new bikini in 5 years...yup, that's 5 years...i've been wearing the same things over and over...and can't wait to visit a water park to get a much needed tan   Trip to Vegas in November! My hubby is dragging his feet cause he doesn't want to spend the money, but I've been saving like crazy and I'm confident we can afford it.   My coach purse that hubby promised me...hahaha... mababaw  *    The fact that I've been able to regularly work out for 2 and 1/2 months.  There's been a slight improvement in the belly area, but the best improvement is with how I feel.   Almost ready to take my network+ test! Wish me luck.   This real estate deal that is coming together for me and my partner...even if it doesn't pan out, at least I did  something  to make goals a reality instead of giving lip service to it   My hubby of course! He's the best!   Japanse food....gosh, they're so yummy and have been enjoying eating them a lot lately.=)     *this is a Filipino word for shallow\n\nText 2:Friday Five revisited   I really, really missed them, so when I saw that there is now an  urlLink livejournal online community  for friday five, I was very happy!    1. If the world were to suddenly end right now, what do you wish you would have done?  I wished I had told my family and husband that I loved them, that I had sky-dived, gone white-water rafting, visited the countries I wanted to visit.  All the goals I had outlined to accomplish when I was in high school.   2. How many times do you hit the snooze button before getting out of bed?  About 3-4. I'm really, really bad at it.   3. What cartoon do you enjoy watching from the present (or the past)?  I loved Tiny Toons, and now enjoy Dexter's Laboratory and Power Puff girls though I haven't watched any cartoons in a long time (or any TV for that matter).   4. If you could go to any time and/or place in history, where/when would it be?  I've always wanted to go back to the fifties cause of the cool fashion. I really loved the way ladies dressed back then.   5. If your life were a movie, what would it be rated and why?  I'd rate my public life a PG-13, but my life behind closed doors with husband 'Restricted' (wink, wink)     Have a Great Weekend Everyone!!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

His parents have a really boss pad in a fashionable building on the Gold Coast.  They are part owners of the Chicago White Sox. They have plenty of cash.  As I was walking into the building, I came out of the revolving doors and bumped into, literally, Oprah.    I would pay money to see the look on my face.  My immediate reaction was to say excuse me.  I bumped into someone.  My just as immediate second reaction was to realize who I bumped.  Just as immediately as that, I exclaimed 'oh my God!'  She laughed and said 'no problem' and gave me what I would call a genuine smile.  I have seen her show maybe 5 times in my life.  It seems to be classy and thoughtful, even as it is slick and, perhaps, insincere.    Two things in reply, DJS.  First, I have a friend whose mom was shopping at a posh grocery store in Connecticut and happened to see a very famous man.  We will call him PN.  She went up to him and said 'I'm a big fan' or 'Can I have an autograph?' or some such thing that fans say.  PN said 'get the fuck away from me': hostile words in a hostile tone.  I can only imagine that I am one of thousands of people who have heard about it either directly or indirectly.  So, PN had a really bad moment.  PN is probably a flaming asshole.  But, there are times when it makes me wonder about the burdens of celebrity.  Myself, I would not want to rich, powerful or famous.  But, if I had to avoid one, without a doubt, I would avoid fame.  What a curse. Oprah has all three.  Second, I'm not sure I blame Oprah for her popularity.  She is the consummate Capitalist, no doubt about it.  She is all about the dollar that's clear.  We used to debate the merits and demerits of her book club at Barnes and Noble all the time.  I think, in general, we all concluded that she got people to buy good books and read them (two good things).  I can say with certainty that she was surprised by the popularity of her book club.  I don't know that it is her fault though.  I also think that, as you get to know Jonathan Franzen (and 'The Corrections' is phenomenal BTW) you will realize that in the jerk Olympics, he would easily lap Oprah, and then flip off the crowd as he accepted his gold medal.    But I have to admit I am an Oprah apologist.  I like powerful women in general (I even admire Martha Stewart though I have never seen her show or read her magazine, and even though I am troubled by the insider trading scandal when I was in high school, I had a Geraldine Ferraro thing that woud not quit - I can admit that among friends, right?), and I tend to root for the success of AfAms in general.  Having said that, I know there is probably much about her that is worthy of criticism.  I just wanted to say that there is much about her that is worthy of praise too.  Last, I have a friend who has a friend who worked for Oprah for years. The friend told my friend (who told me) that Oprah is very hard to work for (very demanding, very particular, a perfectionist and often uncivil), but also very generous and supportive, and, in a strange way, one to cultivate a (dysfunctional, yes) family atmosphere at Harpo productions."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Well, besides the big bald head; my head is small and hairy.\n\nText 2:'Thoughts During My Morning Shower'  For some reason, the memory hit me of one of my biggest fears as young child:  loud noises.  The vacuum cleaner's whine induced a deep panic that led me to run to the couch and bury my head under the cushions to drown out the noise.  Rather, I remember when we had our old couches, we had these 1.5' by 1.5' seat mats that went on each individual couch cushion.  They were about an inch thick and had these ornate embroidered patterns of Asian swans and plants.  It was always my proud task to keep them neatly in place on the cushions.  It was under these things which I hid my head.  Furthermore, when my mom took me to the supermarket in Flushing, the loud forklifts similarly drove me to fear.  I nestled my head in my mom's coat to block away the noise, sometimes crying during the ordeal.  I wonder if my mom remembers me doing that.  ****  Thinking about those seat mats made me recall another memory.  Sometimes, when I was five years old, I wanted to play a joke and scare whomever walked into the living room.  I would lay on the couch and place the seat mats on top of me, so that people wouldn't notice I was there.  When they came to sit down, I figured that I would pop out and scare the living daylights out of them.  However, I didn't have the foresight to realize that when people were making the motion to sit down, there wasn't much time for me to get up and out of their way to do my deed.  As a result, on the first try, my mom came into the room and was about to sit down, but I didn't hear her.  Next thing I know, I felt a suffocating weight on my face and I squirmed and pushed out of panic.  I scared my mom all right, but it scared me more than her.  You'd think I would have learned from that, but I figured that I didn't do it right that time, and kept trying again.  No one sat on me again, only because no one happened to come in whenever I hid.  It's funny what memories come up while taking a hot shower first thing in the morning."], "gold_label": 1.0}

To me, it seems to be done to gain sympathy and attention, in order to affirm self-importance/self-righteousness.  Complaints essentially say, 'This isn't the way things should be, I deserve more.'  Complaints are a declaration of ones' self-importance, aren't they?  The sad thing about all of this is that people find more pleasure in complaining instead of praising.  We seem to be so much more content about finding the faults in our environments versus rejoicing in their perks.

Yesterday I went to the Andy Warhol exhibit at MOCA with Julia and Naomi. It was quite a good exhibit. I've never seen so much art from one artist before. They had everything from Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Kennedy, Chairman Mao, to Elvis in addition to soup cans. Afterwards we met up with Janet and Flo to go to Citywalk. Citywalk... is... pretty much like any of the other outdoor malls here in southern California... such as Downtown Disney, Spectrum and the Block. It just has what I guess is a 'hipper' vibe since it's quite a destination for people in the Los Angeles ADI. I hadn't been there in about 2 years, and it's still just as crowded. We had some good Italian food at Bucca di Beppo and it was quite fun hanging out with my female posse as it always is. As Suzanne commented on not too long ago, I have a lot of female friends. It's cool though. These girls are enough like my buds of the 'Irvine Posse' from high school, that it's always cool just hanging out. Of course things are slightly different being they're all girls and I'm the only guy in the group, but I never feel out of place.   Today, was relaxation for most of the day and eating leftovers from Bucca di Beppo. My 'Irvine Posse' did come over so we could watch the WWE PPV. We had some fine, but cheap beers such Quilmes from Argentina and various versions of Eureka beer. It was lots of hanging out and talking, the PPV was mostly a background thing... the good thing is it was free thanks to Derek's box. From what I remember of the PPV, it was pretty good. Nothing too spectacular though. I found the DX chants from the audience when HBK came out to talk to Triple H amusing. Goldust and Booker is always funny. Bischoff is just such a heel, he's great in an annoying way.  Tomorrow I have work, I don't know if I'm supposed to go in at 8 or 8:30 AM...

OK, so her parents have paid for: a new apartment, a new car for him, furniture, and the wedding ceremony. They're also buying him a laptop (Koreans also exchange rings, but since he's a doctor and can't wear his ring at work, he figured he'd get more use out of a laptop). He's paid for: the honeymoon. But wait! Yesterday he had a change of heart, called ex-gf and said that she would have to pay her half of the honeymoon. I'm not sure why, but I think it's because Koreans also buy clothes for each other when they get married (wtf  don't  they buy), and womens clothes are more expensive than mens. Now, it had always been agreed that this honeymoon (5 day trip to Paris / Switzerland - cost: about 1200 pounds per person) would be paid for by him, and as such her and her parents had not budgeted for this extra expense. Bottom line is... she'll have to take a loan out / borrow money from someone to go on her honeymoon. She turned up at my place in tears yesterday. She'll be marrying this absolute fuckwit in 6 days' time. I'll be there, taking pictures / superimposing his head on gay porn and distributing it throughout the Gwangju medical world.     *for the lazy, the mp3 is two Nickelback songs being played at the same time.

ALLERGIES!!  i guess like since i've been having allergies (especially this past weekend in LA at disneyland cuz of the heat and pollen and stuff) my ear was like trying to protect itself with earwax! disgusting huh!!  so the doctor cleaned my ears, with like a water thingee that he squirts into it.  and guess what- i PASSED out.  can u imagine! it was so strange, one moment i was fine and talking to him about how disgusting ear wax was and the next thing i knew i was getting lightheaded and things were fluttering and i just kinda like fell backwards.  good thing he caught me!  but yah, that was really really strange.  no worries im aok and ear wax free now!! but he says my eardrum is definitely very red and irritated!!  after that i headed off to work 12-5.  what a day what a day.  man like i was the only person on the phones there 12-5, and there was SO much to do be done.  unlike my previous job where i could just like refer pissed off customers to my supervisor, nope not this one! here for whatever purpose,   I   am the supervisor.  man how tiring.  i had 2 customers who were so mad about stuff that i couldnt do anything about! this one guy even got his DAD to get on the phone to yell at me. sheesh.  anyway, thats my day so far. hopefully tonight will be better.  gotta do reading and pick up a lab from my pal eduardo- hes my lab partner, and ive been so flaky recently cuz of work and everything but hes been GREAT dealing with it.  im so lucky to have such a cool lab partner! :)  kk byee!\n\nText 2:I've been here for two hours and did nothing.

God's jealous for my heart; not because I would benefit Him, but because He deserves to be the center of attention, and because it's for my sake.  Why, you as?  He knows that I would be the most satisfied if it was Him I desired.  It all seems so wrong.  It seems like I've screwed everything up.  I should go home now."], "gold_label": 0.0}

It was fairly annoying, as I had two finals and they were back to back.  They could have gone better, but I really don't care as I'm graduating.  Thank God.  Now I need a vacation, so I'm going to go home tomorrow until Friday (I plan on being back in Rochester around 11am).  After that hell, I went to the Honda dealership to see if they could tell me where the rattling noise was coming from my car.  The guy said it was the heat shield, which is apparently this useless part of sorts on the exhaust system.  He said that it would cost about $38 to get it cut off, but he didn't know if he could fit me in this afternoon.  I said it was ok; I only wanted to make sure it was ok to continue driving the car.  I'll change the oil in the car when I go home, so maybe I'll see where this heat shield thing is located and cut if off.  I have no idea what I am doing after graduation, and thanks to Bryan (you asshole), I'm thinking about it now.  I did call about the job on campus, but they said they won't be setting up interviews until the second week of May.  This is extremely annoying, as I need to know about a job.

I therefore pretty much printed out all the soup recipes. Wish me luck.. lol :)   I feel so lucky to be alive, and know that life has good things in store for me.

I miss our daily chats, (not the fights), and that is something M. just doesn't fulfill. He's not there for me on a daily basis. Rarely on a weekly basis. I am beginning to like the relationship between me and M, better when it was friends, he emailed me daily, and made time for me often. I don't feel like he has the time for me now.  Then again, when I think of it, I feel like I always ask too much of the other person when I'm in a relationship, and that bothers me. Why do I always feel like that, why do my needs not matter, why am I so needy. I don't get it. I wish I did.

I just got back from the concert... man, what a day, what a night.  The sound check was AWESOME... the keyboardist would start a little melodic riff, the bassist would kick in, then skratch, 'the human turntable', would start doing some crazy record noises and beat boxing.... seriously, i think he's better than Rahzel.  After they kicked us out from sound check, I went home and met up with Cyrus, Louis, and Tony.  We came back, and after waiting a while in line, we finally got in.  The opening act, 'Cex', was a white guy who was a former Hopkins student (he would be a junior right now).  He had talent and he was putting everything into his act.... but.... it was not quite an enjoyable experience for me.  The crowd didn't seem to liike him either and kept booing him.  I felt really bad, I know it takes a lot of guts to get out in front of alot of people and perform, but still... he just didn't have that 'it'.  Give him a few years, and maybe he'll make it.  After he walked off, it took the band an hour to get onto stage.  Seriously, NOTHING was going on on the stage for over an hour, it was quite annoying.  But as soon as they came on... WOW.  They came on with all the lights out, and they started to hammer out a reallly solid beat.  The bassist (named Hub) was grinding out a pumping riff, the drummer (named ?uestlove) was workin' the bass drum, the keyboardist was hammering out this nice little riff, Skratch was goin' nuts, and Black Thought started to rap like none other.  WOW. They were just incredible for the whole concert. They had these impeccable stops and go's, coordinated dynamics, etc... when they were jamming, they broke into COUNTLESS numbers of covers, little snippets mixed in... ranging from Dave Matthews Band, Nirvana, Guns 'n Roses, Charlie Brown theme song, Super Freak, and a lot of rap stuff as well.  At the latter part of the concert, they showcased of the band members.  First up was the drummer, ?uestlove.  He has such a stripped down drum set-up, but he gets such crazy rhythms... so talented.  He started off with a nice solid beat, and by stopping the bass drum, snare, etc., he gradually stripped the elements of the beat until it was down to the hi-hat.  He then started to do this CRAZY syncopated rhythm on the hi-hat, played the rims and sides of the drums, and gradually worked across the set to the big tom.  At that point, the guitarist came up with a pair of sticks and started to play the snare; ?uestlove then got up, and they started to rotate in and out while keeping beat.  So cool.  The guitarist was up next, and started to do a slew of crazy stuff... jazz to metal to alternative... he broke into Dave Matthews' Crash, Nirvana's Smells like Teen Spirit, and when he started to play Guns 'n Roses' Welcome to the Jungle, the whole band joined in. It was so funny to hear Black Thought belt out like Axl Rose... he did a good job, I'd say.  The keyboardist was really funny, he was playing classical stuff, funky stuff, Charlie Brown, etc.. he did a lot of atmospheric, rhythmic grooves as well; crazy.  The bassist was awesome.  He eventually broke a string, but man, he kept it going strong... he was nuts.  Then.  Skratch.  INCREDIBLE.  He sounds just like a turntable scratching, and mixed in with his beatboxing... oh DEAR.  INSANE.  He'd similate scratching a record with his hand, and 'scratch' along with it... then he'd break into a breakbeat.  All you a capella beatboxers should listen and learn.  Well.  I must say.

I also realized how limited that vision was.  Most of all, It was striking to see how much more important the vision, heart, and soul of the people playing is than the actual ability of the players.  Why? Music that has life has it because its function is to communicate life.  If the players aren't passionate about expressing what they're feeling or thinking about (usually both), then music becames mere entertainment.  I gave a sermon today to the youth group; I presented the gospel. Next week, I'll speak on how to apply it.  This evening, I cooked dinner with my brother and watched 2 movies.  Goldmember (my roommates had d/l it) and Amelie (DVD), both using my new setup with the computer and tv hookup.  Tomorrow's grad school orientation.  School starts next week.  Am I ready to start again?  Am I ready to tackle life?  Am I ready?"], "gold_label": 0.0}

His first letter is to Sankarsan Prabhu, a dear Godbrother of mine based in Austin, Texas.  December 1, 2003  Dear Sankarsan das,  I am trying to locate a devotee who taught me a great deal many years ago. He headed up the Temple of Understanding in Durban, South Africa, in 1987. His name was Indradyumna Swami.  He then went on a trip up the Amazon, and since then I have lost track of him. I would really love to talk to him again. He inspired my life at the time and started me on the road to higher consciousness.  I should be most happy if you could help me with this or steer me toward someone who could help me locate him.  Hare Krsna, Lance Ackerman                          ******************  December 3, 2003  Dear Lance,  Please accept my blessings.  Here's a hot link that you can use to e-mail Indradyumna Swami.  indradyumna.swami@pamho.net  Hoping this meets you in good health,  Always your well-wisher, Sankarsan das                          *******************  December 8, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  I am not sure if you remember me.  I first met devotees in Durban, South Africa, back in 1988. I was lucky enough to stay at the Temple of Understanding and even sat in meditation with you. The year after this I had to undergo national conscription in our defense force. I turned to the temple yet again and went through this as a religious objector, never carrying a firearm and somehow managing to stay vegetarian through out the whole two-year ordeal. I cannot begin to tell you how much the devotees helped me - collecting me on Sundays and taking me to Misty Hills [the Krsna Farm outside of Johannesburg], and then stuffing me full of prasad and sending me back with enough for the week, as well as some to give to all the others in my camp, many of whom had never heard of Krsna.  Whenever I complained about how terrible my situation was in this 'war environment' I found myself trapped in, you would laugh and tell me Krsna was placing all these obstacles in my way to make me see that the only way forward in this age of illusion was Krsna Consciousness. You would say the sooner I resigned myself to the truth, the better for me.  When you heard that I spent a lot of time in the bushvelt and had no Bhagavad Gita to read, you gave me a small copy. This fit in the ammo side-pockets of my pants and meant I always had access to the word of Krsna.  When I look back and realize how many blessings Krsna was bestowing on me at the tender age of 19, I now realize you were correct: there was only one real choice for me. Unfortunately, hindsight is always better and not a privilege you have when you most need it.  Unfortunately, I eventually fell back into my material ways and now find myself, at age 35, lost in maya and understanding less than I did when I was 19.  In 1994 I was diagnosed with a disease called cardiomyopathy and am now bedridden and battling for each breath I take. I often thought of contacting you and asking you for guidance, but never have until now.  Recently, when my heart dropped to a working rate of just 17%, the doctors installed a pacemaker. For a while it seemed like the miracle I had been waiting for. However, this was short-lived, and I developed something called atrial fibrillation. The result was that I eventually had to go to the hospital to have my heart shocked back into rhythm.  It was at this point that something happened which told me I had to contact you for guidance. In the hospital my neck beads, which I had been wearing since you placed them around my neck, fell off and left me in fear of demonic powers. It felt like Krsna was deserting me, or perhaps it was me that deserted him?  Now I find myself in a state of depression, wondering about suicide. But my belief in karma will not allow me to do that either.  Please help me. I do not know who else to turn to.  Hare Krsna, Lance Ackerman                          *******************  December 10, 2003  Dear Lance,  Please accept my blessings. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.  Thank you so much for your letter, which brought both joy and sadness to my heart. Joy that you have contacted me after so many years (I do remember you!), and sadness to learn of your severe illness.  I would like to help you, as I can understand that you may be nearing the last stage of your life. Of course, life is eternal, and if we are devotees of Krsna we are simply evolving slowly towards our service in the spiritual sky.  The Lord may be giving you notice of your imminent departure, and like Maharaja Pariksit (who knew he had only seven days to live), you should become very, very serious now about hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. There are specific duties we have at every stage of life, and the duty of one approaching the final stage is to completely absorb himself in sravanam-kirtanam, hearing and chanting about God.  Should you survive your present ordeal by the grace of the Lord, there will be no loss in such hearing and chanting. It is always auspicious! But if you are to leave your body in the near future, such hearing and chanting is the best way to prepare yourself for death.  A devotee can make a lot of advancement at the last stage of life. I have seen it many times. It is sort of like a sprinter who on the last lap sometimes gets a second wind, which propels him ahead to win the race.  So begin making an extra-special effort to advance towards life's ultimate goal, love for Krsna. Leave behind all other considerations. Just focus on what you know is right and is in your best interest: Krsna consciousness. You are in the most favorable circumstances for doing just that. The Lord knows best what we all need to make progress in Krsna consciousness. So there is never anything to lament.  I am coming to South Africa in January. I will be there until February 28. I would love to come and visit you, wherever you are. We can talk more deeply then.  But know for sure that I'm with you all the way. Somehow you have remembered me after all these years. You can count on me to help you in your present situation.  I look forward to hearing from you again . . . and seeing you soon.  Your servant always, Indradyumna Swami                          *******************  December 18, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I would like nothing more than to see you.  I have never forgotten you, because you had such a lasting impact on my life. I knew what you would tell me, so there were no surprises, but to think that I may have your association again leaves me ecstatic!  I am going to immerse myself in hearing and chanting, something which I have long since stopped doing.  I will tell you, it is not the thought of death that scares me, because I understand and realize it is just another step along my spiritual path. What does concern me is the way in which I will die. It is a very painful process indeed. It also makes your arrival seem a very long time away.  I also worry about the effect of my death on those around me - my family, who have been my strength during this period of my life. They are not devotees, or even remotely close to devotees, so I will need to talk to them and explain Krsna consciousness so that they can understand.  I live quite close to the airport and would gladly send someone to collect you. I am afraid I will not be in a position to come to get you personally at this stage. But I long to speak with you!  Just hearing from you has filled my heart with joy and lifted me a great deal. I am going to work very hard to survive until you come.  I am at a loss as to what else to say, so I will just say goodbye and go find my beads and begin chanting.  Hare Krsna, Lance                          *******************  December 24, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  I am Lance Ackerman's sister. Lance died yesterday after a long debilitating illness. He spoke to me about your forthcoming trip to South Africa, which he was very excited about. He was determined to stay well long enough to meet with you. He was overjoyed to hear from you.  Lance and I have shared a home for many years. I had watched him getting weaker and more reliant on his family over the past few years. Since May of this year he had been permanently bedridden. Throughout all this he lived fearlessly, with love, joy, compassion, and intelligence, even at the worst times.  Recently, however, he became fearful, filled with anxiety and anger. When your email arrived he was about to go back into the hospital. Except for twenty-minute catnaps, he had not slept for weeks. He was despondent, in constant pain and discomfort. But after your letter arrived he slept peacefully for the first time in weeks. He made a remarkable recovery and did not have to go to the hospital. He was no longer fearful or anxious. He was relaxed and said he felt at peace.  He said that for years he had lost touch with his beliefs, but felt he was now on the right track again. He was happy and serene. Your letter gave him great comfort.  I am heartbroken that my little brother has gone. I will miss him terribly. I wanted him to hang on at any price. But I am also grateful that he found an inner peace before he died and that he was able to let go when he was ready, without fear. I thank you for that.  You had a great impact on his life. He tried to describe why he felt so joyful to hear from you, and what sticks in my mind is what he described as your passing on to him a special grace - a grace that touched him at the very end.  With thanks, Gail Ackerman                         *******************   January 31, 2003  Dear Gail,  It was with great sadness that I received your letter.  I was so much looking forward to meeting Lance again after many years. As you said, he wrote to me only a few weeks ago, asking for help in the difficult times he was going through. I am content that I was able to give him solace in the last moments of this life.  His spiritual quest grew more and more important to him in his last days. I suppose this is natural for all of us. That he died peacefully is a sign that he achieved a level of spiritual understanding and satisfaction for which all of us can be proud of him.  Like you, I will miss him. But I am sure that Lance's higher goals have taken him to a place more beautiful than the one we live in now.  Thank you for taking the time to write to me. I appreciate it very much.

Anywho, back to blogging; I found this on CNN:  urlLink Strangest taxes . This one is the best: Illegal drug tax: At least 11 states, including Alabama, North Carolina and Nevada, tax people who possess illegal drugs. Usually, though, you have to be in possession of a minimum quantity (for example, over 42.5 grams of marijuana in North Carolina) to be subject to the tax.  But no need to wait for the police to cuff you before you cough up the cash. In North Carolina, for instance, when you acquire an illegal drug (or even 'moonshine'), you can go to the Department of Revenue and pay your tax, in exchange for which you'll receive stamps to affix to your illegal substance. The stamps serve as evidence you paid the tax on the illegal product.  Don't worry that you might get in trouble for admitting you have enough drugs to fuel a rave party for years. You needn't provide any identification to get the stamps and it's illegal for revenue employees to rat you out.  Still, according to North Carolina's department charged with collecting the unauthorized substance tax, only 77 folks have voluntarily come forward since 1990. Most of them are thought to be stamp collectors. (Or perhaps they were just high?)  The majority of the $78.3 million the state has collected thus far has come from those who got busted and were found without stamps.  But even if they had had stamps, it's not like their legal troubles would be over. 'Purchasing stamps only fulfills your civil unauthorized substance tax obligation,' according to the N.C.

I dreamed that Lynn and I went to Dr. D.'s funeral (knock on wood -- as far as I know he hasn't passed) &, surprise, surprise, it had quality stamped all over it.   Sorta.  Or maybe just bizarre carnivalesque stamped all over it.  We had to park downtown Cedarville, and I ran into Dave Hamblin (current Malone student) over by Lawlor Hall, only they had broken up Lawlor and were calling each wing a different name.  He lived in the back wing and when I asked if I could stop by to borrow a tie, he said sure stop by Unit 28 in Ashanti (hindu for peace).    Well I had to get going, because I knew things would be getting started.  I joined mom, dad, ang & lynn in the vestibule of the D.M.C. (which had been added onto with another vast floor above the existing one.  Floor to Ceiling window.  Candles burning EVERYWHERE and -- of course -- the pep band.  Trying to play staid music.    They were interupted by David Robey and Dave Ormsbe.  'Make no mistake,' said Robey, 'this depiction is true.  Jesus died as a virgin.'   Suddenly there were torches and drums and sitars playing.  and actors dressed as roman soldiers and disciples and Caspar Van Dien dressed as Jesus.  He looked astonishingly like the White Jesus paintings that have dominated the last couple centuries of Jesus-depicting.  (BTW ~ went to  urlLink embody site  yesterday, and this is clearly some source material for the dream ~ look out its flash and you can probably only spend enough time if you've got a fast connection)  'Jesus' gave a speech on abstinence and gradually laid down on the floor in the middle of the crowd of Cedarville students come-to-mourn.  Roman soldiers hoisted his body up and took it away.    Inside the auditorium, the band had already started playing, but the band director came up to me (not anyone I'd ever met before) and let me know that he had met me last year at homecoming.  I smiled, nodded, shook his hand, played polite.  But he just stared at me like that meant like we had LOTS to talk about.    it's the kind of interaction that I imagine  urlLink Daniel  having on a regular basis with his parishioners. (btw ~ if you have a weak stomach, beware that last link).  So then I had to go give my regards to Pat D. who had taken to a large queen size bed right there in the foyer.  Gloria was in a chair by her bedside, telling her a hilarious story about getting lost on the way to the funeral.   She was laughing and laughing until I started talking, I was relating a story about cleaning out my closet.  Pat just turned over and went to sleep.  I slipped into the auditorium where Jeff Beste was leading the congregation in hymns.  Incense was burning everywhere. Pew candles at the end of each pew were lit and there were thousands of people there.    John Ruhlin (Malone student) got up and gave a talk about the inevitability of scientific theory catching up with theology eventually.  Only he was absolutely too smart for me to understand.  (that's when I knew it was a dream.... JUST KIDDING!)  It is when i started waking up...  well, we leave for our last pilgrimage of the summer later today so the blog will be relatively silent for the upcoming week.  hope you become deeper and truer this week.  and that you rest.  that may be one of my resolutions this schoolyear -- REST as a spiritual discipline.

After you get through the picture on the homepage, there really isn't anything else.  But anyhoo...I was reading and it's quite funny actually, these pro-life people.    If you should decide to brave the really really really gross picture, the link to 'The truth about Planned Parenthood' is really funny.  They try to slander that so badly, placing these weird quotes, and coming to these absurd conclusions.  Such as, Planned Parenthood advocates child sex, the head is a racist (I don't see how that would intrude on the organization), they respect privacy (keeping an abortion secret from the girls boyfriend), and...this is really funny, a quote, Planned parent hood advocates humanism, which is, 'It seeks not to educate our children in moral values, but to indoctrinate them into the Humanist philosophy that proclaims there is no objective moral code, and that right and wrong can be decided solely by the individual.'  So I suppose we should never trust the kids.    I suppose the only non-bias one was 'Politics' because it listed many parties and what they thought, instead of just the pro-life ones.  I thought it was gonna say how some parties could change the world and what not.  Everything else is VERY pro-life, and don't even look under 'No Convinced?' because there's another disgusting picture, I'm sure (I chickened out, and stopped the loading before anything appeared, what can I say, one gross thing a day is good enough for me).   Yeah, so looking at the site has made me realize that there is no way I can ever be pro-life.  Pro-choice is a good thing.  AND a message: Abstinence is where it's at kids.

The woman with the lucky job of answering the phones there calmly explained to me that the mouse will eat the poison put out by the exterminator and then leave your apartment to die.  I wasnt quite sold with that premise as Id think a mouse would choose to die in the plush environs of our apartment versus venturing out into the world for one last adventure, but since we have several senior citizens in our building, this lady gets must get away with such tall tales on a regular basis.  Whatever.  To further complicate all this, Ive seen too many Tom & Jerry, Speedy Gonzales, and even Micky Mouse cartoons to begin to think that its a done deal that the mouse will eat the poison, no matter how enticing.

Some days I'm not sure about philosophy. For instance, yesterday at Ben's talk, there was a heated discussion about analytic philosophy. I have no interest in that, so I ended up talking about mice and the weather with Bassam. Not exactly philosophical.   Ben's point was about the need for negative facts. His prime example was 'John is not home.' Essentially, that tells us nothing. Turns out no one quite understood even what a fact is, according to Ben and Russell's account. Something that actually exists just like furniture in the world. Hmm... and having too many of them is a problem, for some reason.  Back to Parmenides and my problem at hand. I have to write a paper. Nothing is striking me. These days philosophy talk just makes me feel all pretentious, I guess because I've been explaining it to people who have other interests.

It's all I've eaten.  Is it possible that I'm groggy because I haven't had a balanced meal?  Well, I held true to my promise so far up till now.  I haven't spent more than 20 minutes on the computer checking online journals, and I didn't go on AIM (except to add someone's SN on my list, but it was a 'sign-on, add name, sign-off' deal).  I organized all of my papers, notes, etc.  I started to read my Biochem.  Then, I fell asleep again, and dreamed this weird dream.  I came home, and we had to get ready to go to a retreat.  To my surprise, it was Grace Life Church that was over at my house, waiting for me.  To my suprise, they were sleeping over because it was going to be a retreat overseas.  Even to my FURTHER surprise, I saw Eric Ahn, who is in Hope Chapel.  I think my brain was confused and smushing my two undergrad churches together.  So, I went to sleep, and awoke.  I got ready, then my mom told me I had to be at La Guardia; up till this point I didn't know it was a retreat overseas.  Furthermore, she informed me that it was free, but I had to be at La Guardia in an hour because everyone else left.  Confused, I asked her how I was to get to the airport with no one to drive the car back.  I never got an answer about that.  Panicked, I hurried my little brother to get ready as well.  We piled into my family's old Ford Taurus, and sped off to the airport.  It was at this point that the dream slightly shifted.  We were still heading towards the same place, but now we were characters in some cheesy '60s spy comedy show.  Our car was still an old Ford Taurus, but it was falling apart at all the secret hinges that concealed the fancy features.  For example, as we made sharp turns, one half of my seat slid forward, and one slid backwards.  I had to hold them down with my thighs to prevent that shearing effect, and drive at the same time.  It was frustrating, and we realized that the evil organization was trying to slow us down.  That's when I woke up... but you know, I feel more tired in my body than I was before I went to sleep.  I hope this isn't mono.\n\nText 2:Final tomorrow.  Going to bike home in the freezing chill of the twilight, hopefully it will not invigorate me to be wide awake by the time I arrive home.  Necesito dormir.  ****  Do I have no willpower at ALL?  I notice that during the evenings I always go through a time of repentance and regret for all the stupid things I did during the day, vowing the next day shall be better.  Then, during the mornings, it's as if I've forgotten all the I vowed, and do the same stupid things throughout the day that I promised myself I wouldn't do.  *rolling eyes, throwing hands up*  When I talk about salvation, I feel and see myself being like 'the boy who cried wolf.'  All this talk feels so shallow, when my life is so slow in reflecting what I praise with my lips and promise with my words.  So, when the real storms hit, and when I really do cry out these things in much deeper honesty, it will seem to others and maybe even myself that it's not to be taken seriously. Or, vice versa, because of all I previously said was taken seriously, this real crisis that I would be reacting to would not seem as a greater crisis.  I am still caught in my heart with the message that I read and preach, because it still doesn't seem to be fundamentally something my heart is responding to.  It's times like these where I start to question the validity of the message of the Gospel in my life.  Then I realize that it's the Gospel that lets me recognize these things in the correct light in the first place, and it's the Gospel that keeps me headed forward.  I am inclined to sin, but my direction is headed Godward.  I will make mistakes, but I will learn from them.  It is the promise, the fact that I'm forgiven, the proof of history that keeps me fighting myself from repeating them.

When you know that someone is worth everything to you, when all the things you love is represented by that one special person. Then you realize you're starting to drown into a deep abyss of unexplained emotions. Mixed with joy and pain, laughter and surprises.   Each and everyone of us is in search of something special, something great, something larger than life. As we begin our journey, there are people who become part of our lives for they have shared something special w/ us. It could be a short-lived romance, an intimate affair, a secret pact, a lifetime friendship, or it could be something else. And as we move on to our destined path, we often stumble and make unwise decisions and always, there's someone who reaches out to offer love, comfort and security.   And then we find meaning in life more than just the word itself. We learn to find beauty and contentment in little things like quiet walks, intimate conversations, a movie &amp; dinner for two, late-night phone calls and other mushy stuff. As we experience these moments, we give in to the giddy rush of love. It's when we feel like there's always a reason to smile, the feeling of butterflies in our stomachs. Then we realize we're losing ourselves to that someone and that the person we are sharing these moments w/ is everything to us.   But in the course of every relationship, there's always a time when we love too much and forget about ourselves. Forget that we also have a life of our own and that there's more than just being with that person. We spend way too much time loving and caring for that person that sometimes, we don't realize that the other person also needs some breathing space. We might not know it but there comes a point when they feel suffocated and pressured that it drives them off the wall. Sooner or later, the other person wants to have some breathing space, some time alone for themselves because they can't quite handle the overwhelming rush of our love for them.   Then we start to have doubts, lose trust and question almost everything which leads to arguments like exchanging of heated words and sometimes physical violence until finally, one has to give up and drift away. As a result, we breakdown, lash out, blame other people for what happened. We even lose sight of what's real and what's not but what we don't realize is that we brought this down to ourselves. We're responsible for what went wrong and this realization comes to us a little too late. Too late to make adjustments, too late to compromise, too late to take back what we have lost. Soon enough, we have to face the fact that we're the victims of our own choices. We have to understand the pain of losing someone and how hard it is to get up on both feet and bounce back.   We always have to learn our lesson the hard way. More often, it takes a lot of heartache and buckets of tears before we realize that life goes on but still, we continue to love inspite of the pain, tears, and heartbreak. Maybe it's the cliche that heartbreak causes pain, pain makes us stronger, tears make us braver, and the painful experience itself, makes us wiser.   It takes time to heal. The pain of losing someone we love always leaves a mark on us. Like an ugly scar that only time can somehow heal as we move on with our life. As we begin to heal and re-invent ourselves, we start another journey. A journey of self-improvement to re-discover ourselves and take pleasure in the things we deprived ourselves before when we we're busy making someone else the center of our universe.   But of course, we soon try to look for someone who could offer the love and affection we need. Someone who would take the time to sit down and talk about simple things like what you want for breakfast, what movie you want to see, or what brand of cologne you prefer. Someone with a good sense of humor, whom you can laugh with. Someone who thinks you look great even if you just crawled out of bed with your hair all messed up and your eyes puffy from sleep. The one person who would take your hand when you need someone to hold on to, the one person to kiss you and hug you tight and say ' It's gonna be alright ' when the odds are up against you, the one person who would be the last call of the day, the one person at the other end of the line who'll say ' Goodnight ' and ' I Love You Too .'   We might have loved the wrong person and cried for the wrong person but we shouldn't regret that because we learned so much from that experience. Instead, we should remember this one true thing: In this life, there's a very special person who's meant for us. Someone who represents all the things we want in life. It may take some time or even forever before we cross paths with that person but we just have to believe &amp; have faith that the possibility of an honest-to-goodness relationship is just within reach. I guess we just have to look and see for ourselves. Who knows? that person may be the one who could handle the love we can offer, with no hesitations, no questions asked."], "gold_label": 0.0}

The Seven Samurai :  Found it to be all that it was cracked up to be, something I would spend money to buy.  I also watched  The Magnificent Seven  since it was an adaptation of The Seven Samurai.

It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's 'Cars' or perhaps Berlin's 'The Metro.'

(AP) \ufffd A woman who collected more than $70,000 from the Red Cross after claiming her still-living husband died in the Sept. 11 attacks has been accused of fraud, authorities said.    The scam fell apart when Donna Miller's husband walked in while a detective was interviewing her at home, authorities said.  Miller, 49, of Sparta, was charged Thursday with three felony counts of false pretense and released on $10,000 bond. Besides a possible prison term, she could face restitution costs if convicted.  Kent County Sheriff's Detective Steve Moon said Miller told officials at the American Red Cross September 11 Recovery Program that her husband, Michael, died when the World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept. 11, 2001.  Donna Miller made the claim during the frantic days following the terrorist attacks and collected eight checks over 10 months, starting in November 2001, Moon said.  Red Cross officials contacted the sheriff's department after she was unable to provide documentation of her husband's death.  Moon said he was questioning Miller at her home about her supposedly dead husband when the man walked in.     There is no indication Michael Miller participated in the scam and he will not be charged, the detective said. '     Really?

I uh...basically went to class, hung out with Betsy, hung out with Kenny (don't feel like detailing this one heh, as I just did in Fifer's email...ask me about it later) and that was all good and fun.  Music is deck.    I got this thing in my box and it was called, 'Three in Thirty' (referring to the policy of having to get three quiet hour docs in thirty days to get any points): The TAMS Underground Revolution Issue 1.  Some underground extremely opinionated newspaper type thing that Mallory Chesser started up and on the back it said, 'Lisa, join the revolution.  Scoop is poop.' (Scoop is the name of the official TAMS newspaper).  I thought it was really cool.  The articles said things that we could never write in the real newspaper, and they only give it to cool, underground people.  There were what I would consider editorials on a lot of different things, including politics and such.  Some were downright hilarious.  Anyway, Terra said that the reason I was invited to write for it is because Mallory had read my stuff in Scoop and thought it was the only good writing.  I felt honored because Mallory is the TAMS kid that writes for NT Daily.  Anyway.  That was pretty cool.  So is the boy though.  Hehe.  Hanging out with him was really really fun today.

There's still some confusion about what was wrong with me but the best guess is that I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured and caused an infection.  I'm still taking medication to help with the pain.  Trying to wean myself off of it though.  I woke up this morning with pain off the chart.  I was completely disoriented because it hurt so much.  I wandered the hall crying for a bit before I found a nurse who took me back to my room and helped me.  At any rate when I woke up I took a shower and felt a lot better.  Eventually Dr Brown came in and told me I could come home today.  Catherine dropped me off and got the rest of my medicine.    Its so nice to be home with the boys.  My own bed. And a nightgown that closes in the back.  Getting the pick line out was the best thing.  I have a huge hole in my arm though.  I didn't expect that.    ANYway... Lani and I are going to go to the interview on the coast on Sunday.  I'm very torn.  I think I would love the dispatch center there, I know I like the area, but I would miss my friends.  Being sick really drove that point home.  But my family would be there, and I'd make new friends.  I can see myself living there for the rest of my life.  Also a strong selling point...  I guess the only thing to do is to go to the interview and see how things go.  If they offer me the position then it was meant to be, otherwise I'll keep plugging away here.    I am most definitely doing something about my weight though.  Its completely out of hand, and for the first time I couldn't do something because my ass was too big.  So tomorrow I'm going to call and withdraw from my classes.  I'm too far behind and really don't think I'll be able to catch up.  Especially if this job comes though I've just got too many things to worry about.  In place of that I'll be going to the swim center.  Not really having an appetite for the past week also helped get me started.

I figured that I should start writing my paper up. Sure I still need to take a look at a few more sources, but I pretty much know what I want to write about... so I'm getting started now. The paper is supposed to be 15-20 pages. I figure with that the non-body portions is already going to be about an additional 4-5 pages... so it could potentially exceed that.  I think that tomorrow... I'm going to work more on my paper, this webpage, and my art projects.  In rotation right now is  Skid Row 's  Slave To The Grind  (1991) and  Bad Religion 's  Process of Belief  (2002).  ***\n\nText 2:Yesterday was fun. I went to the City of Irvine's Global Village festival, had some free food, and watched Steff do a hula performance. After that I went to Steff's birthday celebration at the Spectrum. It was very enjoyable, despite everything at the Spectrum being overpriced.   The following is mostly in response to Crystal's dropkicks on an earlier post.   The issue of people who dress punk, makes me think of the end of the movie SLC Punk and some of the questions raised. At what point is clinging on to a certain aspect of a genre, scene, etc. unrealistic? How much does a changing society as well as a growing person deal with this?  Call me an old man at 24, but it's seems to me a lot more teenagers sport the 'look' than us older folks. While I have nothing against people's freedom of expression, I guess what I'm trying to question the juvenile tribalism of this (by juvenile I simply mean youth). I don't really think that mohawks, leather jackets, etc. are real markers of the lifestyle, as that stuff is all fluff and spectacle. They say less about punk, than the individual and what they think is or isn't punk. One only has to think about how people talk about authenticity.  It should be noted that back then, not every one dressed that way (especially in the diverse LA scene). Also most of the bands themselves do not dress that way anymore. So what does that mean? What does it mean when a couple in their 30s tries to show their 10 year old how to mosh in a museum? Is this reverance and preservation of cultural simulacra?  Crystal suggested that you can't help it if corporations encroach on the lifestyle, and things change, but can stay true. However, if you accept that, does that mean you accept that Sum 41 and A New Found Glory are in some way just as valid of punk as Black Flag and the Damned?  I don't have the answers, but I think that a problem is that a lot of younger people who listen to punk 'buy' into the music without thinking about what they are doing. That's my whole point of raising these questions. I would, of course, never say that the people whom I've shared time in the pit with are all poseurs. It's just that I worry about these kids, who end up growing out of punk rock, because they never really understood what they were doing to begin with.  ***"], "gold_label": 1.0}

Still the authorities have given us no explanation as to why the permit to enter Italian waters that had previously been granted was suddenly withdrawn. ......

We think that a solution must be worked out in accordance with International Human Rights laws and based on humanitarian principles.

During the Civil War, saltworks was a main focus of attack a strategy that hamstrung the Confederates for the entire war. When the South surrendered, they requested provisions because Robert E.

ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Jeremy Kilpatrick.  It looks at the issue of state testing of math proficiency.  From the ERIC Digest:  In recent years many states have developed their own assessments of student learning in mathematics, usually aligned with state standards or curriculum frameworks. Many of these assessments are intended to have high stakes: financial or other consequences for districts, schools, teachers, or individual students. In some cases, teacher promotions or high school diplomas may depend on students achieving passing scores. As of 1998, 48 states and the District of Columbia had instituted testing programs, typically at grades 4, 8, and 11 (Council of Chief State School Officers, 1998).    Many states report the results of high-stakes assessments by school or by district to identify places most in need of improvement. State responses to assessment results vary. Some states have the authority to close, take over, or 'reconstitute' a failing school, but to date only a few states have ever used such sanctions (Jerald, Curran, & Boser, 1999). Florida awards additional funds to schools that perform near the bottom or near the top of the range (Sandham, 1999). When schools or districts with poor results do not show sufficiently rapid improvement, some states revoke accreditations, close the schools, seize control of the schools, or grant vouchers that enable students to enroll elsewhere.\n\nText 2:Blogger Idol Top Picks   Oh my goodness, that took forever.

Unbelievable.    urlLink Swimfan , 2002 - 3 stars A 'Fatal Attraction' for teens.      urlLink Life as a House , 2001 - 4 stars I bawled (but take this from a girl who's cried while watching  urlLink Colonial House  on PBS).  Great cast.    urlLink She's the One , 1996 - 3.5 stars A good sequel to The Brothers McMullen.  Some sub-par acting and predictability made me rate it a little lower.  But Eddie Burns is in it and he's hot, so...    urlLink The Opposite of Sex , 1998 - 3 stars  Lisa Kudrow is great, but I couldn't really get into this film.  It didn't seem to be leading anywhere (not that each film should, but it felt like this one wanted to...does that make sense?).  Forgettable.   urlLink Beyond Borders , 2003 - 3.5 stars  I am surprised I haven't heard more people talk about this film.  It has an importance, but only if you look past the Hollywood-ness of the cheesy love story.  What fascinated me was that it was filmed on 3 continents with a limited budget and they did not try to make the poverty look pretty.  When Angelina Jolie's character was in Africa, she held a boy who was truly starving to death.   urlLink Devil's Playground , 2002 - 4 stars  OK, don't laugh.  This is a documentary about the Amish.  For some reason, I am so curious about this culture - this film highlights the time in a young Amish person's life where he/she must decide whether to embrace or leave the church.  Excellent.   urlLink Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown , 1988 - 3.5 stars  I liked the last Almodovar film I saw (Talk to Her) so I thought I'd give this one a try.  It's hysterically Spanish and Antonio Banderas is young and squeaky clean!   urlLink Tom & Viv , 1994 - 3 stars I'm a fan of TS Eliot, but not a huge fan of this movie.  It was extremely difficult for me to watch.    urlLink Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! , 2004 - 3 stars  Don't hate...I had to throw a teen romance in here  somewhere .  Plus, I love Topher Grace from That 70's Show.  He's so my type.   urlLink All About My Mother , 1999 - 3.5 stars  Yep, you guessed it...another one from Almodovar (no, he doesn't make every successful Spanish film).  What do you want - transvestites, love, death, birth?...you get it all here.   urlLink The Ring , 2002 - 3.5 stars Freaked me out.  Is still freaking me out.  It's freaky....although, when I found out it's a remake from a Japanese horror flic, it didn't seem quite so scary anymore.   urlLink Casa de los Babys , 2003 - 3 stars Terrific cast, but too many characters (or too little time?) to develop even one of them appropriately.      urlLink Italian for Beginners , 2000 - 4 stars Ever hear of  urlLink Dogme 95 ?  This was Lone Scherfig's first attempt at this rather pompous way of filmmaking.   Dancer in the Dark  also attempted to adhere to the Dogme 95 manifesto, but is considered 'Dogme lite' because of some 'cheating' - it's use of music, the director's mention in the credits, etc.   Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself  is out now, and, from what I've heard from interviews, Scherfig was happy to go to the opposite side of Dogme.  She described it as going up to a buffet line and being able to eat all you want again.  Filmmaking aside, IFB is a touching story about friends and relationships - and it's Danish!  It's amazing when you take the unnatural beauty away from a film, how easier it is to just focus on the characters.    urlLink Ma Vie En Rose , 1997 - 4 stars  So sweet.  And so heart-wrenching.   urlLink L.I.E. , 2001- 3.5 stars  Difficult and disturbing subject matter - not for the faint of heart.   urlLink Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her , 2000 - 3 stars  I didn't love or hate this movie.  It was blah.   urlLink I Capture the Castle , 2003 - 3.5 stars  There is no action, no suspense, and it's a little contrived at times. It is, nonetheless, an absorbing and enchanting film.   urlLink Love Liza , 2002 - 3 stars So, so, so depressing.  Perfect part for Philip Seymour Hoffman who always seems so defeated anyway."], "gold_label": 1.0}

I've been offered the job of on-call Firefighter/EMT.  That's right.  Just like I mentioned in my haiku some months back, I'm going to be a fucking hero.

Contrary to popular belief, I've never taken a single illegal drug in my life.  Yes, friends.  That also includes smoking 'the pot.'  Never have, never will.  Does that make me square?  Fuck you.   Test # 2 - The Physical  Boy, was this one a real bastard and clocked in at over 2 hours long.  Not just the usual 'turn your head and cough' that male physicals are used to be.  I found out that I weigh 10 pounds more than I thought, my blood pressure is high (a connection?), and that sitting in a gown in the check-up room for 45 minutes can be a very humbling experience.  I also managed to offend the nurse.  She asked if I would mind if she drew blood from a certain vein.  I said 'Hey, you're the doctor or...assistant' as my voice trailed off.  She said, 'Actually, I'm a nurse.'  Yeah?  Well, you've got stanky breath and you could use a shave, nursey.  Yee-ha!   Test # 3 - Head Test  This doesn't happen until I get back from Colorado.  Wait...let me rephrase that.  The day I've set aside for recovering from the roadtrip, I'll be spending 5 (count 'em) FIVE hours taking a psychological profile.  Then, I'll have some head doctor talk to me for an hour at the end.  Jesus Christ!  This is what I'm doing with my day off???

If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.\n\nText 2:Guess who got to chat with Daddy on the computer this morning!

I'm not dating anyone currently, but this getting married thing seems to be catching on like wild fire. Not that I am opposed to it. In fact, when I was in my last major relationship, I was pushing for it myself. But why? Did I think he was the one? Well, it did cross my mind, but I just saw him for the first time since we broke up on Sunday (after the Sat. wedding) and it is amazing to see how far we both are from that now. Does it make sense to get married when you don't know what you yourself want out of life? I'm starting to realize that the answer to that last question is 'no.' So, I don't think I am going to go looking for a husband any time soon, since I need to figure out my own path first.... but I must say, it is difficult to sit there by yourself and witness all the couples planning their weddings knowing how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

Anyway many things happened. Stuff that are better forgotten. As the saying goes- Let sleeping dogs lie.  Have been visiting the red sea twice a month for 2 mths now... almost like a while back. Worrying but was told that itz normal. It'd better be.  Kae's very funny of late.  He watched the Gatsby ad wit hthe enthusiastic man singing about styling one's hair and commented (at the end when he becomes an old man and then a skeleton) that 'Never eat rice become like that.'  LOL  Then, today was bathing him (and he insisted on stripping his own clothes off) when I used the a different shampoo from the one he wanted to use... and he said 'Mummy use wrong shampoo for you. Must wash with this one only. Boy boy's hair delicate.' And then he proceeded to re-wash his hair with THE shampoo he wanted. (shakes head in disbelief at her fussy 2 year old)  He also enjoys playing with his fake laptop when I am doing work at the com and proclaiming 'Mummy work. Boy boy work also! Boy boy grow up work channel i (or channel U or when he wants to 'suan' me, he says channel 5 or 8! he can tell btw the competition!!!)

So what happened was that Kae was a good boy- shaking hands of everyone he saw and smiling. And then, my dept head and his family arrived. He has a daughter 2 mths older than Kae called Peppermint. Kae thrilled to see another kid, immediately went over to give her a hug and then tried to give her a kiss. Everyone keeled over from laughing and I hope my dept head too otherwise I prob won't get my perm status!!  Another funny incident happened when Peppermint who was sitted on her dad's lap across the room from Kae (who was perched on my lap) and myself. She wanted to look for her Mum who had gone to take something from the kitchen so she cried out 'Mummy??' And my son looked at her and said in a very annoyed tone 'Mummy here lah!' Everyone burst out laughing. I had to remind Kae that he had a different Mum from Peppermint. LOL.  Then, during the birthday singing part of the party, Kae smiled and looked bashful as everyone sang the birthday song and when they were done, he turned around wanting to blow the birthday cake! He thought it was his birthday too! =)   After we left the place and got a cab to head off home, Kae crashed the moment we left the vicinity as he had played so hard and it was past his nap time."], "gold_label": 1.0}

What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?   I read fiction 99% of the time, but I like non-fiction and poetry too.    2. What is your favorite novel?  It is almost impossible for me to answer that question.  I have so many favorites (ask HAL).  But, if I had to pick one book, I would pick  Moby Dick .    3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Why Regret By Galway Kinnell  Didn't you like the way the ants help the peony globes open by eating off the glue? Weren't you cheered to see the ironworkers sitting on an I-beam dangling from a cable, in a row, like starlings, eating lunch, maybe baloney on white with flourescent mustard? Wasn't it a revelation to waggle from the estuary all the way up the river, the pirle, the kill, the run, the brook, the beck, the sike gone dry, to the shock of a spring? Didn't you almost shiver, hearing the book lice clicking their sexual syncopation inside the old Webster's  New International  - perhaps having just eating out of it  izle, xyster  and  thalassacon ? What did you imagine lay in store anyway at the end of a world whose sub-substance is ooze, gleet, birdlime, slime, mucus, muck? Don't worry about becoming emaciated - think of the wren and how little flesh is needed to make a song. Didn't it seem somehow familiar when the nymph split open and the magfly struggled free and flew and perched and then its own back split open and the imago, the true adult, somersaulted out backwards and took flight toward the swarm, mouth-parts vestigial alimentary canal unfit to digest food, a day or hour left to find the desired one? Or when Cassonova threw the linguine in squid ink out the window, telling his startled companion, 'The perfected lover does not eat.' As a child didn't you find it calming to think  of the pinworms as some kind of tiny batons giving cadence to the squeezes and releases around the downward march of debris? Didn't you once glimpse what seemed your own inner blazonry in the monarchs, wobbling  and gliding, in desire, in the middle air? Weren't you reassured at the thought that these flimsy, hinged beings might navigate their way to Mexico by the flair of the dead bodies of ancestors who fell in the same migration a year ago? Isn't it worth missing whatever joy you might have dreamed, to wake in the night and find you and your beloved are holding hands in your sleep?  [please don't sue me, Galway]   4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  The great works of Russian Literature.  Up next:   The Brothers Karamazov  and  War and Peace .  Yep, Duf' is serious.    5. What are you currently reading?   The Body Artist  by Don Delillo. Up next:  rereading  Lonesome Dove  by Larry McMurtry.\n\nText 2:So, my little brother just got from Hong Kong yesterday.  This morning, I got an e-mail from him with 'SARS' in the subject line.

Tomorrow is payday, so I'll finally have money in my account again after my vacation that I can touch without worrying that I'll be bouncing checks left and right. Although not having money for two weeks has made me a little more conscious about some of my spending habits lately. I've decided to drop my phone plan down a notch since lately I haven't been yapping on the phone all day long and mostly keep the talking to the free hours. I just hope that I can keep my 8pm weekday start hour for free calls. I've also decided to ditch the digital cable since I only watch like 3 channels (CNN, Discovery, and Tech TV, ok and I guess Comedy Central, too). If I could just get these plus local channels to watch Packer games I'd be fine.  I might even start selling some of my extra crap here on EBay. Once I find something that's worth a little bit...maybe I can still get some good cash for that Spiderman comic with the first appearance of Punisher... Here's another I'm soooo geeky bit.

When you hit Morehead City limits you know you are at the beach.  Windows are being rolled down and the warm, musty salt air begins to hit your face.  Your hair begins to curl almost instantly.  You know good grits are on their way too because beach water makes the best grits.  You cross the bridge over the Bogue Sound and see a glimpse of that magical water, part lake, part ocean, part river, all saltwater and controlled by the tides.  There are clams and oysters and sand dollars and porpoises in this water too and you wish you were staying on the sound.  At the light after the bridge you take a right toward pine knoll shores, just a few miles away from Atlantic Beach, from you childhood.    The house sits in front of the ocean, facing what seems to be an endless amount of water.  You can\u2019t believe there is actually something beyond the point that your eye can\u2019t see.  The horizon is so far away that you see whole clouds from top to bottom in the distance.  Some nights, there are storms at sea, you see the lightning, but the rain and thunder never make it to shore.  You wonder what good a storm at sea does, were any boats caught in it?    Some days the wind is so strong on the beach that you have to stay in or go to the inlet or to Fort Macon or a day trip to Beaufort.  Some days there is no wind and the heat comes off the sand like it is willing you to leave.  Some days the rain comes in at lunchtime and moves you from your saltwater post.  Everyday, you want more, more sand clinging to your toes, more saltwater up your nose.  The ocean pummels and turns you out.  You keep going back to it.  In low tide there are tidal pools a short distance from the dune.  These are your favorite. There is enough seawater to float you on a raft and as the tide is leaving there are enough waves to keep you moving.  The tidal pool is the best of all worlds, no thought of a rip current and all the luxury of   On calm nights the moon glows in the sky so bright that the reflection off the water mimics daytime.  You swear you could see by it.  You know that nighttime is the best time on the beach.  The beach is yours then because no else ventures to the beach at night.  You sit on the deck and look at the horizon or the shape of the moon.  You feel like you have a secret that no one else really wants to know about.  How could anyone not love the beach more at night?  You don\u2019t understand the fascination with the daytime, the sun and the rain, when the nighttime brings the moon and crabs and loggerhead turtles.  You know the secret and though you try to share it, others prefer sleep.     Soon you must leave the crystal coast of North Carolina.  No other beaches in the world will compare.  There is simplicity and elegance in North Carolina\u2019s crystal coast.  There are very few trappings of fancy dwellings or pools seamlessly flowing into the ocean.  There are just beach houses, many are old, and some are new or just well kept.  But the house isn\u2019t important, it\u2019s the beach the matters.  It\u2019s the weather and the sand and the promise of good shell hunts.  It\u2019s suntans and bathing suits and rinsing off before you come inside.  It\u2019s a morning swim then lunch then back again then dinner out.  It\u2019s beach towels draped over the deck at the end of the day.  It\u2019s the day\u2019s catch on the pier or at the surf.  It\u2019s floppy hats and sun visors and sunscreen and big umbrellas.  It\u2019s rafts and buckets and shovels and sandcastles.  It\u2019s enduring the grit of the sand and the stickiness of the water.  It\u2019s the oldies station on the radio and it\u2019s your family all around.  It\u2019s the beach in North Carolina and part of you doesn\u2019t ever want to leave.\n\nText 2:Apologies for not replying sooner...   I didn't go to work yesterday. Apparently I missed a good Pandyland day. Duf, I really liked your message to the cookie people.  As far as calendars go, I have a 'play with your food' one that is hilarious. It was a gift from 80 degrees (I believe we're supposed to refer to our friends via code names, and that is hers) and it also came with stickers, which I love. This month a strawberry is kissing some puckered-up piece of green produce (possibly ugli fruit?). I use the adorable fruit/veggie stickers to mark PTO days, and rubber ducky stickers (also a gift from 80 degrees) to mark the days I work out. Next month I am switching to shamrocks and leprechauns, and the month after I am switching to easter eggs and baby chicks. I need the motivation to get me to the gym.  I also have a perpetual postcard calendar, which was a gift from Hal. I love this calendar, but it does put a little pressure on my because it is displayed in a place where people walking by can see it, and if I don't change the date right away in the morning (every day!) I hear about it. People actually use it as their source for date information - which I don't recommend, because I cannot be counted on to change it every day.  I also used to have a Wells Fargo calendar in my cube, but I gave it to my honey because his calendar at home expired at the end of last year (imagine that). And our 'trinkets and trash' vendor gave us all ceramic coasters with 2003 calendars on them, but I threw mine away because I thought it was tacky. It didn't fit with my desk's decor (most of the items, including my little green lamp which was a gift from Panda, came from my trip to Ikea with Hal and Panda several years ago). Finally, I have a little Kandinky calendar that was also a gift from Hal, but I cut off the calendar parts and just hung up the pictures.   My computer, office phone, cell phone and both of my watches also tell me the date. I track most of my appointments in Outlook though, but have a Clinique day-timer (given to my by my coworker, who got it as a free gift with her purchase and was going to throw it away) that I use for easy and portable reference.

When he changed the header (yeah, the GTI has a 'performance' header) he ripped the oxygen sensor out of its little cubbyhole.  Well he twisted the wires all together, then twisted the wires around the swaybar.  There they sat, shorting out everytime they got wet and grimy, or everytime they touched each other.  So Don fixed all that up and only charged me $53.25 (he worked on my car for at least 3 hours)!  I drove my GTI home and drove my Mom to the dollar store last night; he ran fine.  I do believe he's fixed.  Don stuck him on the scope thingie, and the engine code thingie; all is well.  The coil is fine, as are all of his other operating systems.

I'm having the tranny seal replaced in 2 weeks, when I receive my tax refunds, and I'll probably have Don do the master cylinder too.

The fact that the Reagans are irritated at the Bush administration for tossing around Reagan's name and legacy makes me giggle.  I might feel differently if Bush had actually created some jobs in the past two years, but he's gone no where on that.  What will I do?  Anyway, article is below:   Reagan blasts Bush  By David Talbot, from Salon.com  April 14, 2003 The Bush inner circle would like to think of George W.'s presidency as more of an extension of Ronald Reagan's than of his one-term father's. Reagan himself, who has long suffered from Alzheimer's disease, is unable to comment on those who lay claim to his political legacy. But his son, Ron Jr., is -- and he's not pleased with the association.   'The Bush people have no right to speak for my father, particularly because of the position he's in now,' he said during a recent interview with Salon. 'Yes, some of the current policies are an extension of the '80s. But the overall thrust of this administration is not my father's -- these people are overly reaching, overly aggressive, overly secretive, and just plain corrupt. I don't trust these people.'   Reagan spoke with Salon from his home in Seattle, where he lives with his wife, Doria, a psychologist. A former ballet dancer ('At 45, I'm afraid those days are over'), he has worked in recent years as a magazine journalist and a TV personality, currently hosting dog shows for the Animal Planet network ('I live 'Best in Show''). He and Doria have three cats, but no children ('They're like kids, without the tuition'). Though he never followed his father into politics, Reagan takes a strong interest in public issues, serving on the board of the Creative Coalition, an organization founded in 1989 by performers like Susan Sarandon and Christopher Reeve to politically mobilize entertainers and artists. Reagan recently moderated a Creative Coalition panel discussion in San Francisco on the topic of free expression during wartime, featuring Alec Baldwin on the left and Michael Medved on the right (and a smoldering Sean Penn in the audience).   Reagan, still as lean as he was in his dancing days, has a sharp tongue -- but like his father, he has a knack for softening his barbs with a charming affability and disarming sense of humor.   Reagan took a swipe at Bush during the 2000 GOP convention in Philadelphia, which featured a tribute to his father, telling the Washington Post's Lloyd Grove, 'The big elephant sitting in the corner is that George W. Bush is simply unqualified for the job... What's his accomplishment? That he's no longer an obnoxious drunk?' Since then he's been quiet about the current occupant of the White House -- until now.   Some observers have compared Bush's persona as an intellectually challenged but politically gifted leader to that of Reagan. But the younger Reagan vehemently rejects the analogy. 'The gunslinging cowboy, the actor who just read his lines -- that stereotype doesn't fit who my father really was.   'My father had decades of experience in public life. He was president of his union, he campaigned for presidential candidates, he served two terms as governor of California -- and that was not a ceremonial office as it is in Texas. And he had already run for president, against Ford in '76, nearly unseating the sitting president in his own party. He knew where he was coming from, he had spent years thinking and speaking about his views. He didn't have to ask Dick Cheney what he thought.   'Sure, he wasn't a technocrat like Clinton. But my father was a man -- that's the difference between him and Bush. To paraphrase Jack Palance, my father crapped bigger ones than George Bush.'   Reagan says he doesn't have anything personal against Bush. He met him only once, at a White House event during the Reagan presidency. 'At least my wife insists we did -- he left absolutely no impression on me. But Doria remembers him very negatively -- I can't repeat what she said about him, I'd rather not use profanity. I do remember Jeb -- a big fella, seemed to be the brightest of the bunch. And of course their parents were very charming.'   But Reagan has strong feelings about Bush's policies, including the war in Iraq, which he ardently opposes. 'Nine-11 gave the Bush people carte blanche to carry out their extreme agenda -- and they didn't hesitate for a moment to use it. I mean, by 9/12 Rumsfeld was saying, 'Let's hit Iraq.' They've used the war on terror to justify everything from tax cuts to Alaska oil drilling.'   Of course, Reagan's father was also known for his military buildup and aggressive foreign policy. 'Yes,' he concedes, 'there are some holdovers from my dad's years, like Elliott Abrams and, my God, Admiral Poindexter, who's now keeping watch over us all. But that observation doesn't hold up. My father gave a speech a couple years after he left the White House calling for 'an international army of conscience' to deal with failed states where atrocities are taking place. He had no thought that America should be the world's policeman. I know that for a fact from conversations I had with him. He believed there must be an international force to intervene where great human tragedy was occurring. Rwanda would have been a prime example, where a strike force capable of acting quickly could have gone in to stop the slaughter.   'Now George and Dick and Rummy and Wolfy all have a very different idea about America's role in the world. It was laid out by [Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul] Wolfowitz back in '92 -- Iraq is the center of the Middle East, its axis, and it's of such geo-strategic importance that we can't leave it in the hands of Saddam. We need to forcibly change that regime and use Iraq as a forward base for American democracy, setting up a domino effect in the region, and so on. My father, on the other hand, was well aware of the messiness of the Middle East, particularly after [the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in] Lebanon.'   Reagan says his opinions about the war were not changed by the rapid fall of Baghdad. 'Look, whether or not Saddam was a bad guy, or whether the Iraqi people were terribly oppressed, was never the issue. I mean I'm happy for the Iraqis, but that's not what this was all about. Nor was the military conclusion ever in doubt; this was the Dallas Cowboys playing a high school team. Their army was a third the size it was in '91, and it didn't give us much trouble then.   'And the weapons of mass destruction? Whatever happened to them? I'm sure we'll find some,' he laughs. 'They're being flown in right now in a C-130.   'There were, and will be, a lot of people killed over there. And if you don't care about the Iraqi casualties, what about the American? We stand to lose more people in the next months of occupation than we lost in the weeks of war. One of the reasons we escaped largely unscathed so far was because our military moved so fast. But now we're sitting targets -- we have to establish bases, patrol the streets, guard checkpoints. We're sitting targets for suicide bombers and other terrorists.'   Reagan's parents were notoriously remote from their four children. Ron Jr. reportedly had the closest relations with his parents and he remains close with his mother, Nancy Reagan, who as the keeper of the Reagan flame is often called upon to dedicate public sites bearing her husband's name. Reagan says his mother shares his 'distrust of some of these [Bush] people. She gets that they're trouble in all kinds of ways. She doesn't like their religious fervor, their aggression.'   Reagan says his family feels particularly alienated from the Republican Party over its opposition to embryonic stem cell research, which could have significant benefit for Alzheimer patients like his father. 'Now ignorance is one thing, ignorance can be cured. But many of the Republican leaders opposing this research know better, people like [Senate Majority Leader] Bill Frist, who's a doctor, for God's sake. People like him are blocking it to pander to the 20 percent of their base who are mouth-breathers. And that's unconscionable -- there are lives at stake here. Stem cell research can revolutionize medicine, more than anything since antibiotics.'   Reagan, who says the label 'progressive' would fit him, does not belong to a political party. 'I'm certainly not a Republican; I couldn't belong to any party that had leaders like Tom DeLay. And the Democrats are too busy trying to out-Republican the Republicans.'   His father entered politics at a relatively late stage in his life, after careers as a sports broadcaster, actor and General Electric pitchman. Has Reagan ever considered running for office? No, he insists, 'I have no political ambitions. For one thing, I'm not interested in raising all that money. It's just not the life I want to lead. When is the last time you heard a politician speak his mind? McCain? Yes, he came close. But I once asked him at a Creative Coalition meeting, 'You talk passionately about this nexus of money and influence that is corrupting our democracy. Why don't you name names?' His response was a demurral.   'I have no problem with public service. And yes, better people should be running for office. But personally I just can't see myself doing it, to live in Washington D.C., the whole package. I was immersed in that my whole life. I saw politicians up close and there were so many who just repulsed me.'   What if a group of concerned citizens approached him and helped raise money for his entry into politics -- would that make a difference? 'You mean like they did with George W.? 'Hey, you've got name recognition, that's all that matters -- we'll give you millions of dollars to run!' Imagine coming to a man with just two years' experience in public office, and a ceremonial one at that. Imagine installing such a blank slate in the presidency of the United States! This is a regency, not a presidency.   'And they told us, 'Don't worry about W. not knowing anything, good old Dick Cheney will be his minder.' Dick Cheney? And this was going to be compassionate conservatism? Dick Cheney is to the right of Genghis Khan, he wants to drill in your backyard, he wants to deny black people their rights --it was all there in his voting record for us to see. What were we, rubes?'   While Reagan rejects a political career, he clearly doesn't shy from speaking out. What if GOP conservatives, who still lionize his father as the greatest president of the 20th century, pressure him to shut up? 'That wouldn't be a smart thing for anyone to do.'"], "gold_label": 0.0}

It has to do with the CIA secretly sabotaging software the Russians  bought  (UPDATE: 'stole') to run their pipelines.  Opposition to this Administrations handling of the situation in Iraq is founded on the premise that we have not yet found WMD's - fair enough, as far as Joe Average/non-CIA knows.  What today's 'anti-Bush' crowd don't seem to understand is there were many many many reasons to depose of Saddam (womens rights, mass torture/murder, environmental issues to name a few) - however, b/c of the extreme ignorance of the American populous (admit it folks), the administration calculated it would pursue the avenue that would strike the *most* fear in your average American, hence our rationale became 'WMD proliferation'.  Does that mean they 'sexed up the dossier' as has been purported, or that 'Bush lied' - IMO, no, it simply means the President carefully selected his argument.  He consequently won 'the debate' too.  Hindsight being 20/20 doesn't mean shit - I think we can all  agree that with Saddam being gone, the world is a better place.  How all this ties into the slashdot article, is that people who do their homework also knew there were many more reasons to 'invade' Iraq.  In this instance (slashdot article) - we are only NOW (12 years later) finding out about  one  of the tactics our Government (under Reagan) used to cripple the Soviet Union.  According to 'today's' anti-Bush crowd argument, the government should have fully disclosed to  ALL  American Citizens what it intended to do to Russia, have Congress approve it, then have the UN ratify the action.  Honestly folks, how effective would that have been?  Same difference in going to the UN to actually enforce something pertaining to Iraq - I mean, we've already shown the extent of corruption within the UN, and how that pork-barrell bullshit flowed through to Hussein as well.

Well, like buses, this weekend had two reasons - Dad's 50th birthday bash and Titch's wedding.  I do have loads of pictures from my Dad's do, but it's really a bunch of his mates and my relations, which is a bit dull for most, really. Two pictures for your perusal, however.  The most evil picture of Cassidy ever.      Here's my sister, Jo. Considering how thin she usually is... LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT BUMP! Seriously, she was flat as a pancake in the belly 2 weeks ago and now look at her.     And now - the story of Sunday.  Dan, Pops, Inno, TFMrs and I set off in a taxi, after a bottle of champagne, and arrived at the church at 1pm. Since we had an hour and Leeds v Liverpool was on Premiership Plus, we went up to the pub. However, the pub was too piss poor to pay for the match, so we just had to watch build up for the Carling Cup Final and a dog who could open a packet of crisps. We had a pizza, and then went down to the church.     The service was cool - not too formal, except for the vicar going on for ages, and repeating word for word the reading that Vicki had done. Still, much amusement came from the Vicar's understanding of Titch's life ('...his best man, Andrew, who I believe he met at university, possibly as part of the skydiving club...').  And then, outside for pictures!           On to the reception in a minibus, and up to a NICE hotel. It was on the side of a hill, with a long winding road up to the carpark, which had me thinking of The Shining. As we entered, we were greeted by champagne and the most enthusiastic jazz band ever (more on which later).     After various mingling and Danny cracking a highly inappropriate joke about Olwen and Titch in front of her father, we went through for the meal - a buffet. It was a nice meal, but unfortunately, there was some kind of cock-up and our table ended up waiting for ages for our fodder. Here's a pic of Pops slipping into a coma, waiting for the potatoes.     We were entertained throughout the meal by the jazz band, who were pretty damned good. They had a camp, fat singer with odd facial hair, but towards the end, he hung on to a high note for nearly a minute, and then continuing straight into the rest of the song, which was awesome.     One point about the band - they had the coolest bass guitar I've ever seen.     And onto the speeches. Olwen's dad came out with a typical dad speech, including stuff about the road signs of Switzerland (it made sense, but still sounds, appropriately, odd). Titch then did an absolutely awesome speech - he basically managed to come across as a guy who didn't know what to say, but then came out with the right stuff. The best bit of this being when, reading off his list of stuff to do in the speech, he goes 'Er, I have to say how good my wife looks', which everyone laughs at, and then turns to Olwen, looked in her eyes and told her she was beautiful. Jesus, he couldn't have planned that better - it nearly had INNO in tears! Jarratt then managed to get a pretty good speech out, based around the fact he had been BANNED from mentioning several stories (hopefully, Jarratt will send me Olwen's e-mail to him...), and brilliantly called Titch 'Titch' several times throughout.     So, after the meal and a few more drinks, came JENGA!!!!     (Hmmm, that pose could be fun with Photoshop...) A load of games were set up (Twister, Scaletrix and such) but after scaring Titch's cousin off, we had a team game of Jenga. Unbelievably, it went on for ages, until one of Inno's goes. Inno spent about 5 minutes trying to get a block out, and a crowd of all the guests gathered, watching intently. He did it, and we had a couple more rounds with the entire room on tenterhooks! There are two pictures from the wedding that I want - me in Jenga Rambo mode and the moment the tower fell, went shows the despair and joy as the game ended. It was like a cup final.     It was a great day, with the bonus that I'm not too bad this morning! Back of the net. As I said last night, I happily accept having a friend who is the father of a 18 month old child, but having a married friend is extremely bizarre.   I have a question to ask before I finish:     Is this the Worst. Picture. Ever. Taken?  (Oi! Lloyd, you shit. I think if you go through i-do-i-do-i-do.co.uk, it will take you to the Debenham's site.

Yes, everything.   My friend was telling me a story on how a year ago, at around this time, he was on a delayed honeymoon with his then wife. It was a good honeymoon by most people's standards I think. They had a good rest from their work, they were on an island, they snorkelled for the first time, they ate and ate and ate, had karaoke, read books, made new friends.   A year on, my friend, Am and the now ex-wife are fighting for scraps in the Syariah courts over a marriage that went sour some months ago.   At her wife's request, my friend granted the wife's wish to leave the marriage. It was on a fateful October 13th 2003 when Haza, the wife asked to leave the marriage.  Am's work day ended normally enough. At about 10pm he called home to ask Haza whether she wanted dinner.   Their professional lives really left little time to eat at reasonable hours. It was almost always packed food.  'I feel like KFC, want some?', Am asked.  'I share you punya ajelah okay?', she replied.  And so it was, when Am arrived at their home in a suburb in Selangor, he sat himself down in front of the tv. Haza was on the two-seater sofa, reading.  She sauntered down to the floor, and Am fed her the chicken as he had some himself. They talked about something as they ate, more often than not it would be her day at work, and how disorganised her team was.  After the meal, Am went to the kitchen to clean up. Then he sat himself down on the three-seater sofa across from where Haza sat.  Then he asked her the question that had troubled him over the whole week.  'Are you happy in this marriage Haza?'.  She seemed stunned. As usual with Haza, she took a while to respond, and the response was expected.  'Why do you ask?'.  Am then related to her incidences that led him to ask the question. Like how she would leave the family hall in the house into the bedroom to go to sleep, without so much as saying goodnight. Or how she would leave their table at a restaurant without telling him, to go shopping.   There was another incident a few weeks earlier. After attending lectures for a part-time course she was signed-up with at a local university, Haza found the front passenger window pane broken.   She promptly called Am to relate the incident. Am was aware that she had to attend an event in Sunway that evening.  'Right, you drive up to Subang where I'll meet you', Am said. 'You take my car, and I'll tend to replacing the pane ok?'  Haza agreed. They met at the appointed place, exchanged cars and proceeded to each other's destinations.   'Until today, you have not asked me where i got it done, at what cost and you have not even thanked me', Am said, maintaining calm.  There was a long silence after that, which is typical Haza. Am was quite used to this. He'd wait for a while.  Then he asked, 'Why?'.  A little more silence then she muttered, 'I don't love you anymore'.  'And what do you want to do now?', Am asked very calmly, almost knowing the answer, really.  After a short pause, Haza muttered, 'I want us to separate amicably'.  'And by that you mean divorce?', Am enquired.  Am's question was one of those that you ask out of momentum. Her statement 'separate amicably' could only mean one thing.  Haza nodded, the Am stood up, walked across to her and said, 'I will grant you the divorce. But please file the papers'.  Some three months later Haza still had not filed papers. Am finally did, on the grounds that Haza had verbally asked for the divorce.  On February 16th 2004, Haza and Am were divorced, exactly 2 years and 2 days after they married.  And two months later, Haza filed three separate claims totalling some RM35,000 from Am, including a RM20,000 claim for  muta'ah . They've had two arbitration sessions since the claim was filed late April, and another set for June 14th.  So much for love.  That's about all the time I have for tonight. If you want to know more, perhaps I'll write some more as Am relates it to me.  Regards.\n\nText 2:I'm having fun playing with a  urlLink bug on Fark .

EDM wouldn't exist if it wasn't for all these forms, though knowing this doesn't prevent me from liking the final sum more than its respective parts. My friend feels differently. Sometimes I use his laptop to burn CDs for people and last night I found out he then deletes it all. What if someone asks you if you've got any house one day? I asked; his reply was negligible.&nbsp;Earlier in the night I had played him an excellent specimen of hip house (Rythnerd by Joshua) and he said he thought it was pretty good but a few beers later he cheekily refered to it as 'trance hop', thus revealing his true opinion. It's always humbling when someone you respect has little regard for something you consider to be so significant: it totally puts things into perspective and makes you realize we're all more or less a type of one kind or another and none can ever be proven superior. Having said that, trance is a fucking dirty word in my books and I think the vast majority of it sucks and is almost entirely responsible for giving the rest of EDM a bad name. Heaven forbid that anyone does actually produce tracks that fit the trance hop description because that would surely turn even more people off our cause or, worse, attract a horde of dummy-sucking, glowstick-wielding wannabe gangstas.\n\nText 2:Oh for fucks sake.

Apparently it is not healing properly and she can't rotate her wrist all the way from palm down to palm up--she gets a little past vertical and it stops.  So now we have to go back in on Wednesday to have the doctor rebreak it and set it properly.  He's gonna try to do it just by pushing on it but if he can't, he'll have to do surgery.  Both require Andie to be put out.  Andie doesn't have the highest pain tolerance and she doesn't have the greatest feelings for doctors so this will be quite a challenge for her.  They say they'll be putting in an IV which I think will be the worst part of the whole thing for her.  Amy and I were talking about our prayers over this matter.  We were disappointed when we got the bad news from the doctor--I guess both of us just expected God to have healed her.  But as we thought about it, God's healing is what  we  desire but our true prayer will be that His will be done and that regardless of the outcome, that He be given glory.  If Andie doesn't need surgery--to God be the glory.  If she does and heals perfectly--to God be the glory.  If she does not and will never regain full range of motion--to God be the glory.  If something unforeseen happens--to God be the glory.    God's ways are so far above our ways that I cannot even hope to understand them.  The plan He has and the ways He uses us and our lives is so incredibly complex that I do not want to hang my hopes on what I see is best in my eyes.  I will rest in His will and be alert for how He needs Amy, Blake, Andie and me to respond throughout the entire process.  He has something in mind and it will be beyond our wildest expectations.

It also has a good (but dated) bibliography.  From the article:  'As American society has shifted from an economy based on capital goods (industrial) to an economy based on services (information), there has been a corresponding shift in what is expected from American education. Knowing how to ask the right questions may be the single most important step in learning. The process that is conducted in order to find answers to the right questions leads to the point at which information becomes knowledge. Information Literacy--the ability to access, evaluate, and use information from a variety of sources--is central to all successful learning and by extension to all successful living.'

This ERIC Digest is by Bronwyn Coltrane.  The topic is self-evident from the tiitle.  From the ERIC Digest:  When decisions are made regarding ELLs and high-stakes tests, several factors must be considered.    Ensure that the test reflects the curriculum    Educators who are responsible for selecting the tests that will be used for high-stakes assessment must examine how closely a test reflects the curriculum and standards being used in their state or district. As Menken (2000) points out, 'in order for assessments to be effective and useful for educators in instructional practice, they must be deeply entwined with the classroom teaching and learning driven by the standards' (p. 4). If tests are aligned with standards and curricula, students will have an increased chance of demonstrating what they know and are able to do. Teachers of ELLs need to be involved in the decision-making process regarding which tests will be used. For example, testing committees at the school, district, and state levels that are responsible for selecting appropriate tests should include teachers who work with ELLs to ensure that the tests selected for use are appropriate for these learners.    Select appropriate accommodations and modifications    Educators must consider which testing accommodations may be most appropriate for an individual student or group of students. For example, translation of a test into a student's native language may be helpful for ELLs with a high level of cognitive-academic proficiency in their native language, but not for students whose native language skills are weak. Depending on a learner's language proficiency level, it may be beneficial to allow accommodations that affect how the test is presented and how students may respond to it (e.g., repetition and explanation of test items, or allowing students to dictate responses to a test administrator), in addition to testing modifications related to timing/scheduling and setting. With appropriate accommodations, ELLs are more likely to be able to demonstrate their knowledge on the test.    Teach the discourse of tests and test-taking skills    It is also beneficial to raise ELLs' awareness of the typical discourse and formats of standardized tests. ELLs may not be familiar with the kind of language that is used in tests, including many predictable patterns and phrases. It may also be beneficial to teach test-taking skills (e.g., how to approach a multiple-choice question, how to locate the main idea in a reading passage) to help prepare ELLs for specific types of test items they may encounter. Armed with a variety of test-taking skills and strategies, ELLs may be empowered to demonstrate their knowledge on a test, rather than being intimidated by unfamiliar terms and formats.    Use test data carefully    Perhaps most importantly, educators must be cautious when interpreting the test results of ELLs. As with all learners, it is crucial to remember that one test cannot accurately reflect everything that a person knows and is able to do. This point is particularly important if the validity and reliability of the test are questionable for ELLs, or if the students were not given appropriate testing accommodations. In any case, important decisions about ELLs should not be based on a single test score. Low scores on a standardized test may mean nothing more than that a learner has not yet mastered enough English to demonstrate his or her content knowledge and skills on a test. Multiple assessments, including some performance-based or alternative assessments that mirror what students are learning in class, will paint a much more accurate picture of students' knowledge, skills, and progress than any single test score can indicate. Similarly, high-stakes decisions should not be made regarding a program, school, or district with high numbers of ELLs based solely on test data. Such data may merely indicate that a school or district has a high percentage of ELLs, and not be reflective of instructional quality or program effectiveness.    As states move toward widespread use of standardized tests to ensure high standards and accountability in education, many additional issues may arise with regard to how ELLs fit into this movement. It is important to include ELLs in high-stakes tests so that we may set high standards for every student and ensure that all learners' needs are considered in educational reform efforts. However, educators must also seek a balanced approach to interpreting and using test data so that careful, informed decisions are made, particularly when these decisions carry high stakes for ELLs and the schools that serve them."], "gold_label": 1.0}

If you look at the psychology of markets, as well as individuals, the trend we've seen as of late with markets wildly gyrating at the smallest sneeze from Greenspan, is rather disturbing.  I mean, if these people don't have their own ideas of where markets are headed, the people we pay MILLIONS for their opinions, how good can that be?    This is one of the reasons I didn't get into investment management right out of college - something I'd primped myself for for a long time.  It really is a load of hogwash.  If you have a math degree, and can model, you're the same off as the next guy (once you get to a certain point).  Investors have been relying less and less on MARKET and COMPANY fundamentals, and more on playing the guessing game of 'whats the Fed gonna do', 'where's the next big hit gonna be'.  Folks, they are guessing games.    It all comes back to todays society, the 'gimme gimme's' and 'I want it now!now!NOW!'.  Everyone wants to get rich quick, take a ride down easy street.  The stock market, and increasingly other financial 'vehicles' are seen ever more as the means to the end.  This ideology was what led to the boom of the late 90's, and I'm concerned that the bubble hasn't really popped.  If that's the case, we should REALLY be concerned, as whats held up the economy over the last year (refinancing equity out of homes) - is eroding, and the erosion will continue and accelerate as rates increase.    So, maybe the Fed IS onto something.  But the flip side to that is, you can't manipulate a market forever, again, as we saw in the late 90's  :|\n\nText 2:Pulled  urlLink this  off Slashdot - I never knew much about this porsche, but if a 15 year old porsche can beat up on a late 90's McLaren F1, you know they were on to something.

he's got a good future ahead of him in the Democratic Party, especially if he and Kerry can win the election.&nbsp; (we'll see about that.)&nbsp; I appreciated the fact he got into some specifics when talking about his and Kerry's domestic economic platform.&nbsp; Basically, they want to resume certain government-funded programs for the youth and under-priveledged that were closed by the current administration (such as the 3 million inner-city kids who lost after-school programs.)&nbsp;&nbsp;They will&nbsp;also give certain tax breaks/credits to different types of families in different situations.&nbsp; All this, plus making good health care affordable to just about everybody.&nbsp; The best part is how they will fund all of this, since...thanks to the current&nbsp;President (I want my cake and I want to eat it too)...our country is broke.&nbsp; Remember Bush's tax cut?&nbsp; The one where&nbsp;almost half the total money&nbsp;cut went to the richest two percent?&nbsp; Well...Kerry and Edwards are going to keep the tax cut--that is, they're going to let the bottom 98%&nbsp;keep their tax cut--and they'll roll back the cut given to that highest&nbsp;two percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I don't have the number...but it's a lot of money.)&nbsp; That's the main thing--there&nbsp;are some other measures like closing government loophole spending, and less money to the HMO's...and&nbsp;all that jib-jab I can pretend to understand but really do not.&nbsp; I also like the&nbsp;fact&nbsp;Kerry and Edwards will stop giving tax breaks to companies that take their jobs overseas...and will&nbsp;instead give those tax breaks to companies who keep their jobs here in America.&nbsp; I don't think outsourcing will be entirely all that bad&nbsp;in the long run for the international and domestic economy here in the U.S., but I certainly think&nbsp;jobs were outsourced faster&nbsp;and in greater number than they should have been...and millions of Americans have paid dearly for it.&nbsp; The new tax breaks should go a long ways to finding a proper balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Edwards did the standard 'John Kerry: War Hero'&nbsp;bit tonight, which shouldn't surprise anyone.&nbsp; As John Stewart told Katie Couric on this morning's Today Show...he thinks Vietnam has been mentioned more in the past week than&nbsp;at Woodstock.&nbsp; (That's why he gets paid the big bucks.)&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&nbsp;certainly know why&nbsp;the Democrats are pushing the whole Kerry-volunteered-for-war-and-saved-lives thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of people polled say they think Bush is stronger on military-related issues...including Iraq and the&nbsp;war on terror.&nbsp; Considering&nbsp;al Qaida is as strong today as were before 9/11...and we went into Iraq prematurely for what turned&nbsp;out to be false reasons, I'd say Bush has a lower&nbsp;career batting average than any&nbsp;National&nbsp;League pitcher.&nbsp; Since Kerry hasn't been Commander-in-Chief before, I'd say it's kinda tough to say what kind of war president he'd be.&nbsp; But--especially after the current administration seemed so damn trigger happy--I do agree with&nbsp;the following&nbsp;point:&nbsp; John Kerry has been to war...he's been shot at, injured, and has probably killed another human.&nbsp; He's seen all the horrors that war provides, and&nbsp;knows that war can often&nbsp;end with little resolution...little gained.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;he wouldn't be hesitant, but would be more likely to show proper&nbsp;restraint when facing a possible conflict.&nbsp; That's all I ask for...but I do ask for it.&nbsp; I know President Bush&nbsp;does what he thinks is right--but I think&nbsp;his view of the world is a bit too simplistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficult problems, easy solutions.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; Kerry is so often viewed as a confused and two-sided&nbsp;flip-flopper.&nbsp; My first point would be this--if you look at any career politicians' (such as Kerry's) voting records over the decades, some things might come off looking contradictory.&nbsp; Some probably while others aren't.&nbsp; My other point--which really responds to the whole 'I voted for the war before I voted against it' fiasco--is that his critics are trying to simplify this&nbsp;once again.&nbsp; I would hate to be a politician, because anything I did could be made to look a certain&nbsp;unflattering way.&nbsp; Kerry was going to vote to support the funding of the war...but on the condition that funds would come from a certain area (again, I think he wanted to use the rich's money but I'm not sure of the specific details).&nbsp; When it came out that the funds would come out of the general pocketbook of America...Kerry&nbsp;backed out like he said he would.&nbsp; But&nbsp;Kerry, who is very smart, gets himself into trouble by not making it simple.&nbsp; He needs to understand that he's running in a&nbsp;soundbite&nbsp;era--where they are going to take ten seconds and that's it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he says 'I voted for it before I voted against it' and then goes on in his speech to explain himself...well, tough.&nbsp; The networks (and&nbsp;the Republicans) are only going to acknowledge the soundbite...and Kerry needs to realize that.&nbsp; Now, he's the 'policy-juggling fool who doesn't support our troops.'&nbsp; I'm just rambling here...trying to&nbsp;get my own thoughts down so I can make better sense of all of this.&nbsp; Hopefully&nbsp;my writing hasn't been too confusing.&nbsp;   What's funny is I wasn't even going to mention&nbsp;Edwards (and, in turn, Kerry) that much tonight.&nbsp; I wanted to post about an article I read about blogging and bloggers&nbsp;on the ABC News website.&nbsp; It's really cool--you can&nbsp;skim through it  urlLink here .&nbsp;&nbsp;   I'm off to bed.&nbsp; Tomorrow is my typically tyranical Thursday.&nbsp; I'm actually going to interview John Edwards in the morning (no, I'm not kidding)...and putting the story together should take me&nbsp;well into&nbsp;late-afternoon/early-evening.&nbsp; Then it's off to softball, where I hope to play a bit better out in left field than I did last week (I didn't play bad--didn't make any errors--but I thought I should have gotten to a couple of balls I was a half-step away from).

Ohh yeah and then I guess I went to the airport to pick up Jennifer and their were tearful reunions and such and me and her and Laura all went out and saw The Village, which I somewhat enjoyed even though I was told by some people that it sucked.  Seriously.  People say it sucked way more than it actually did.  Just because it wasn't what they expected or something because it wasn't scary.  But hey, maybe, just MAYBE, that wasn't the main point of the movie, eh?  Oh, there was this whole, 'Sometimes people in not doing things, don't do them because they don't want others to know they want to do them.' or something to that effect and then she was all, 'I know he has feelings for you because he never touches you.' Ahaha.  It all makes sense now.  I think.  Then we chilled at Denny's for a while.  And now I am at Jennifer's house typing this while she is reading Spin.

Michael got the cough drop and Erin, the next time I see her, will be awarded the lint.  Sophia and Nathan get imaginary cookies.  Thomas, however, has not posted and will recieve the hat of shame.  This is a paper hat that says  SHAME  on it in big black letters.  Now, Match up time. I put a lot of thought into the last match-up and decided that Stephen Sondheim, as a composer, might get distracted by the pitch and rythm of the little 'bloop' noises and lose.  The pitbull, however, as a pitbull, has no opposable thumbs and isn't tall enough to reach the controls, so old Steve only has to hit the ball once.  Winner: Stephen Sondheim.  Next:  Claire Danes VS Natalie Portman in a waffle-eating contest.  Only the catch is that they are also riding on unicycles, and to win, one must eat the most waffles  and  survive the obstacle course without falling off of the unicycle.  Claire Danes is equipped with an industrial strength vacuum cleaner, and Natalie Portman has a huge autographed picture of the pope.  So, now, to business.  Michael - I am intrigued.  What does this bandwagon jumping entail?  Just that comic, or perhaps others?  Nate and Soph - Do you think those little short posts get you off the hook?  I want real posts or you'll all be wearing SHAME accessories.  (Personal Note: Must find a way to keep SHAME gear from becoming fashionable.) Marten- Today is the day I abuse an admin power.   But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'"], "gold_label": 1.0}

I am so uncreative!  Anyway, I am not really sure what I want to write here today. I am tired of going on and on about how I am feeling.  I am not really sure anymore.  Maybe I am bipolar or something.  One minute I feel great, I am happy and excited about life, and my job and my apartment, and the next I am sad, and homesick, and lonely.    I was at home Monday night through Wednesday night, and I did not want to come back here.  And I did not want to go to work this morning.  And there is nothing so terrible about my job that I shouldn't want to go.  I don't know what my deal is.  Sometimes I really think I need therapy!  But this weekend, I am going to actually get out and do something.  And I am not going home.  Bobbi and her boyfriend and some of his friends are going to Blues Fest in Chicago, so I am going too!  Well as far as I know, as long as it doesn't rain.    Well I am hungry, going to make something for dinner!\n\nText 2:Thought to ponder!   'This is your life.  Are you who you want to be?'    I would have to say, Yes, sometimes!  But today, I did not like who I am.  I cried on the way to work this morning.  I hate that I did, but for some reason, I just started crying.  And I know it's a woman's perogative to cry whenever she wants but I feel so out of control when that happens to me.  I guess it comes down to the fact that I am not happy with where I am right now.  Physically and mentally.  BUT I am the only one who can change that, so I should stop bitching about it, and do something about it.  I just feel like there is so much out there!  So much more that I want to be.  I think I am capable of a lot, but something is holding me back.   I just can't figure it out.  I know exactly what I want, but maybe sometimes I think I don't deserve it.  I really try to be a good person, I try to be honest and real with people.  Sometimes I am a little too real, but that's just who I am.    So basically I HAVE to go to California!  I need to see what's there.  I think what I might be waiting for is my mom to just tell me that she supports me and wants me to do whatever will make me happy.  But I don't know if she is going to do that.  But I can't stay here for other people.  I have to do something for me, I have to make myself happy.  So that's what I am going to do.    I have to tell you all about my 4 year old niece!  She is the funniest kid I know.  She already has this strong personality, and she kind of reminds me of myself.  Myself now, not at age 4.  But last night she wanted to go outside, and she wanted to ride this little 3 wheeler thing.  So I got it out for her, and then she decided she wanted to play with this ball.  So when we are going in the house, I told her to put the 3 wheeler thing away, and she asks me if I am going to put it away.  I tell her no because she got it out, and she said, with a straight face, 'YOU carried it out here.'  She's four, and she has an answer for everything.  So she has already found a loop hole in putting toys away.  She can play with them, but as long as she doesn't actually carry them out of the garage, she doesn't have to put it away.   She's funny."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I don't know how much truth there is in that statement.  I know I personally do not have that much control over my feelings.  I feel what I feel, when I feel it, based on the surrounding circumstances.  I suppose the only way, then, to control my feelings would be to also control the circumstances which affect them.  Ha!

This is by Irene Doskatsch.  It was published in  Australian Academic & Research Libraries , Volume 33 N\u00ba 3, September 2002.  From the site:  Abstract: The establishment of the Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) Institute for Information Literacy Immersion program was partly in response to the laments of influential US university library directors who publicly stated that many new librarianship graduates did not have the skills and knowledge to competently adopt the educative role. The author reports on the results of an informal survey to ascertain the desirability and suitability of an Immersion program for Australian and New Zealand librarians and describes her experience of the ACRL Immersion program. The role of the Australian and New Zealand Institute for Information Literacy (ANZIIL) in facilitating Immersion style programs is also discussed.\n\nText 2:urlLink TomPaine.com - Archives - The Other Buchanan Controversy  Professional discussion regarding sociologist Jim Loewen's book which claims that US President James Buchanan was gay.   From the site:  Wheatland, Buchanan's house in Lancaster, is open to tourists, but visitors will never learn that he was homosexual or much else about him.   In life, Buchanan was not very far in the closet. For many years in Washington, he lived with William Rufus King, Senator from Alabama. The two men were inseparable; wags referred to them as 'the Siamese twins.' Andrew Jackson dubbed King 'Miss Nancy,' and Aaron Brown, a prominent Democrat, writing to Mrs. James K. Polk, referred to him as Buchanan's 'better half,' 'his wife,' and 'Aunt Fancy . . . rigged out in her best clothes.' When in 1844 King was appointed minister to France, he wrote Buchanan, 'I am selfish enough to hope you will not be able to procure an associate who will cause you to feel no regret at our separation.' On May 13, Buchanan wrote to a Mrs. Roosevelt about his social life:   'I am now 'solitary and alone,' having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone; and should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick, provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection.'  King and Buchanan's relationship, though interrupted from time to time by their foreign service, ended only with King's death in 1853. While Buchanan was born and raised in Pennsylvania, William Rufus King was a Southern slaveholder. Buchanan's pro-slavery politics may have stemmed in part from their 23-year connection.  Buchanan certainly thought highly of King: 'He is among the best, purest, and most consistent public men I have ever known, and is also a sound judging and discreet fellow,' as well as a 'very gay, elegant looking fellow.'"], "gold_label": 0.0}

ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Grouws, Douglas A. and Cebulla, Kristin J.   From the ERIC Digest:  The number of research studies conducted in mathematics education over the past three decades has increased dramatically (Kilpatrick, 1992). Research findings indicate that certain teaching strategies and methods are worth careful consideration as teachers strive to improve their mathematics teaching practices. For the classroom implications of the research findings summarized here, please see the companion to this Digest, 'Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 2: Recommendations for the Classroom' (EDO-SE-00-10)   1. The extent of the students' opportunity to learn mathematics content bears directly and decisively on student mathematics achievement.   Opportunity to learn (OTL) was studied in the First International Mathematics Study (Husen, 1967), where teachers were asked to rate the extent of student exposure to particular mathematical concepts and skills. Strong correlations were found between OTL scores and mean student achievement scores, with high OTL scores associated with high achievement. The link was also found in subsequent international studies, such as the Second International Mathematics Study (McKnight et al., 1987) and the Third International Mathematics and Science study (TIMSS) (Schmidt, McKnight, & Raizen, 1997).   2. Focusing instruction on the meaningful development of important mathematical ideas increases the level of student learning.   There is a long history of research, going back to the work of Brownell (1945,1947), on the effects of teaching for meaning and understanding. Investigations have consistently shown that an emphasis on teaching for meaning has positive effects on student learning, including better initial learning, greater retention and an increased likelihood that the ideas will be used in new situations.\n\nText 2:urlLink Research Strategies  This is an online textbook on information literacy by William Badke.  It is excellent!  If you like it, consider supporting the author by buying a paper copy of the book.  From the preface:  Are you ready for your next research project? Really ready? Do you have the skills and strategies to get the job done efficiently and effectively without panic attacks and the need for a long vacation when you are done? Do you have confidence that you can start with a topic you know nothing about and end with an understanding of it that is neither trite nor superficial? Are you prepared to enjoy the experience? [Yes, I did say \u201cenjoy.\u201d]  If the previous paragraph has left you feeling somewhat queasy, this book is for you.  Even if you have significant research skills, you can learn better ones if you take the time to read on.  You have the privilege of living in the information age, with a zillion opportunities all around you to find out anything about anything.  But faced with a humongous number of Internet sites, not to mention library databases of increasing size and complexity, knowing how to navigate through the information fog isn\u2019t something you can pick up easily on your own.  Yet you can hardly call yourself educated if you don\u2019t know how to handle information systems and do research effectively, not in a world in which most careers are built on what you know or can find out.    Getting back to my earlier use of the word \u201cenjoy,\u201d learning how to do research does not have to be painful. It can be fun. Honestly. Personally, I have so much fun that my family has to kidnap me out of the library whenever they want to go on an outing or buy groceries. You can have the same joy that I have.

I just snapped up the CD from  The White Stripes  yesterday.  The verdict?  This DJ likey.  He likey a lot.  I had it in my hand at Target and as I perused the aisles of quality products at reasonable prices, I hemmed and hawwed about getting it.  I knew like 2 songs on the CD and since I was late to jump on the band wagon, it was priced to own at $14.99 (which I think is a bit steep).  On my way back toward the video games, I decided to put it back.  When I did, I set it on another shelf for a clerk to put reshelve later.  Little did I know, but I managed to put it near some other CD offerings...one of which was, you guessed it:  The White Stripes.  Only this one was different.  For a mere $13.99 (that's $1 in savings) not only did you get the CD, but you also got a DVD with 4 (count 'em 4) videos and 2 unreleased songs on it.  Sold.  I can't stress how cool these cats are.

There have been very few pretty games so far this season (probably none), and it's not hard to find fault with this season's hoop team.  One thing you cannot say about them, though, is that they lay down and die.  This team fights.  They don't always play well, but they do play hard, and I still find them fun to watch.  I love Falcon hoops.  That being the case, I'm taking Thursday and Friday off work this week, and I'm following the hoops team to Cleveland for the MAC Tournament.  I went to the tournament two years ago, and it was an awesome time.  Of course, BG had a hell of a team that year, led by seniors Len Matela, Brent Klassen, Keith McLeod, and Brandon Pardon.  They made it to the championship game and ended up losing to Kent State, who went on to charge into the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament that year.  I don't expect similar results this year.  If it happens, I'll be pleasantly surprised, and I'll be there every step of the way.  Right now, though, I just don't know if our guys have what it takes to put together a run.  We play hard, but we don't always play smart.  There are too many fouls, too many turnovers, too many defensive lapses, too many wasted offensive possessions.  I've said it before:  I think we have the talent to win this thing, but I haven't seen enough to make me believe that we will.  Also, the deck is stacked against us at this point.  We came into the tournament as the #7 seed.  That was high enough for us to host a first-round game against a lower seed, but it's all uphill from here.  Our next game, the first at the Gund, is at noon on Thursday against 2-seed Kent State.  If we should win that game (which is possible--Kent beat us twice during the regular season, but we played them close both times, and they've been struggling lately) we would play next at 8:30 on Friday vs. the 3-seed Miami Redhawks (if the seeds hold).  If we should happen to get to the championship game, it would likely be against 1-seed Western Michigan.  It certainly won't be easy going for the Falcons.  I'll be there cheering them on every step of the way, though.  I would love to see our guys make a run at the tournament championship.  Even with the obstacles we face, it's certainly not out of the question.  I do think we've got good talent, and I don't think anyone in the conference is unbeatable.  It'll be tough, but it can be done.  And oh, how sweet it would be if we won the whole thing.  Whatever happens from this point on, my visits to Anderson Arena are over until next year.  That makes me sad, but not as much this year as it usually does.  Very rarely this year did 'The House That Roars' live up to its name, and that's what makes it fun--when it gets loud and crazy in there.  The fans (particularly the students) just never showed up this season, and that's too bad.  We'll just have to hope for better energy next year.  The crowd at last night's game was particularly weak, as BGSU students are currently on spring break.  The announced crowd was just over 1,600, which isn't very good for a tournament game.  Still, there's not much that can be done without the students on campus.  I just hope the crowds at Gund Arena will be good.\n\nText 2:Okay, the movie page is now finished.

(lol....that one is for you, Jenna!)   Ahhh... While I was watching Buffy today from 4 oclock to 6 oclock (uummm..ya...thats how lame I am...you didn't know that already?), I suddenly realized I absolutely LOVE Spike. In case you don't know, Spike is a very hot, (but unfortunately) very vampire-ish character on the show, with an adorable english accent. And, as most will know, I go crazy when I hear a hot guy speak with a british accent. The wierd thing is I usually do not like 'bad boys' but Spike is the exception.   I do believe I will be watching a lot more episodes since my revelation. Buffy is a very good show....lets call it 'educational'. I have learned many lessons since I tuned it. Such as: 1. Always carry a 'shape pointy stick' with you when walking deserted grave yards at night. 2. Your principal is actually a giant evil snake. 3. Everygirl has a soft spot for hot, english, bleach blonde bad boys. 4. It is very tough to be 'The Key'...or its sister. 5.

Practice in the use of distinctive features and rule formalisms.  AS/LING 2140 Fundamentals of Grammatical Analysis : Practical techniques of grammatical analysis exemplified by data taken from a variety of languages.  AS/LING 2430 Language, Power and Persuasion : This course investigates the language of power and persuasion. The language used by powerful and powerless groups is analyzed to determine how it reinforces positions of dominance and subordination. The role of language in public persuasion is also considered.  AS/LING 3160 Discourse Analysis : This course provides an analysis of spoken and written texts in context. Specific topics include spoken versus written discourse; the role of context in the interpretation of utterances; cohesion and coherence; and the relationship between information structuring and grammatical forms.  AS/LING 3120 Phonology : Theoretical principles and practical techniques of phonological analysis exemplified by data taken from a variety of languages.   AS/LING 3140 Syntax : This course provides a basic introduction to generative syntax, in particular to the recent work of Noam Chomsky and his followers. Although most of the data analyzed will be English, syntactic patterns of some other languages will be discussed.   AK/NATS 1700 Computers, Information and Society : Selected survey of the history of computing, information technology and communication and critical discussion of their social impact.  AK/SOSC 1900 Sexuality, Gender and Society : This course examines how the meaning and significance of sexuality, family, work and public life have varied historically for men and women. It is particularly concerned with analyzing the social definition and control of women and homosexuality, which has largely taken place in the interests of the dominant class of heterosexual \u201cmasculine\u201d males.

However, I am going to put them all on this post.     pduggie said... I think Wilson may have been interacting with Hortons article in MR to the effect that when we see that the torah gives commands that promise some kind of inherited blessing as a result of obedience to those commands, that demonstrates that the Torah is a typical republication of the Covenant of Works. But since Reformed theology has usually affirmed that the Torah is still a rule for living in the covenant of Grace, this would seem to be impossible for if we're under the CoG, we can hardly be bound to the CoW.      W.B. Myers said... 'I think Wilson may have been interacting with Hortons article in MR to the effect that when we see that the torah gives commands that promise some kind of inherited blessing as a result of obedience to those commands, that demonstrates that the Torah is a typical republication of the Covenant of Works. But since Reformed theology has usually affirmed that the Torah is still a rule for living in the covenant of Grace, this would seem to be impossible for if we're under the CoG, we can hardly be bound to the CoW.'The difference is 'why' we are obedient to the commands of the COW. Is it to inherit the blessings resulting in our obedience? Or is it because it is the express moral will of God, and we do it out of grattitude. No reformed theologian states that in our freedom from the covenant of works we are no longer bound by the morality of it, but that we are free from the condemnation of it. So, while the law is a typological covenant of works, we are still bound by it in the covenant of grace. One is performed out of obligation for a reward, the other is performed out of gratitude for what has been merited on our behalf.So, while we are not obligated to uphold the COW for a reward, we are obligated to uphold the law of God (which is used in the COW and COG--as per the three uses of the law taught by Calvin and Luther) in gratitude--hence the guilt, grace, and gratitude of Ursinus and the Heidelberg.    pduggie said... Well then I'm still left wondering, because it seems to me there are plenty of examples of the new covenant laying out an offer of reward for some kind of obedience.I can think of Paul's words to children, to Honor their father and their mother that their days may be long, which he says is the first commandment with promise, and John 15:10, where Jesus says if we obey him, we will remain in his love. Heb 10: 35-36 says that when we have done the will of God we will be richly rewarded.I'm not very comfortable looking at all these texts that seem to be motivating me to obedience through the promise of a reward, and claim that I should eschew the offered reward in the interests of only obeying out of gratitude (which ultimately, is the will of God for our obedience too)But then we're still left with a curious continuity between the way obedience is treated in both the new covenant and the older covenants.    Let me state that there are rewards for us who obey the moral will and law of God.  As noted, the first commandment with a promise is to honor/obey your parent that you might live a long life (Eph 6:1-3).  But the promise upon obedience is not the reward of the CoG, namely eternal life and salvation.  I beleive Hebrews 10:35, 36 is not talking about reward based upon obedience to the moral will of God, but the 'obedience of faith.'  I believe the obedience of faith is epexigetical, or that our faith (trusting and resting in Christ) is the obedience commanded of the New Covenant.  Remember, I also distinguish between the 'obedience of faith' and 'obedience to the works of the law,' as does Calvin (see his commentary on Romand 3:27).  Faith is not a work of the law, or obedience to the Ten Commandments.  The 'confidence' about which the author of Hebrews (who I call 'Not Paul') is that which is our assurance in the finished work of Jesus Christ, or faith.  It is through faith alone that we will receive the reward of eternal life.  It is faith alone that meets the obligations of the New Covenant.  I believe Hebrews goes out of its way to show this difference between the Old (Mosaic) and New Covenant.  The 'endurance' spoken of in Heb 10:36 is persevering in faith in Christ, who is the fulfillment of the Old Covenant (the Old Covenant being that to which the audience of Hebrews was contemplating turning).  We 'endure' through life through faith alone, which receives the reward.  Performing this 'will of God' is performing the conditions of the New Covenant: faith alone.  One endures the trials and tribulations, not turning from Christ to the law of God, but continually living a life of faith.  As for John 15:10, this is a more 'difficult' verse for me, personally.  On must also decide about whom this passage is speaking.  Is this passage speaking about believers and unbelievers in Christ?  Of is this passage speaking about believers--who will never go to hell--who will be 'judged,' not 'condemned'?  Though I am inclined to think this is speaking of those 'in Christ' through baptism, or members of the New Covenant (i.e. Judas Iscariot being the prime and contextual reference for being taken away/off by the Father), I would not say our remaining is based upon our obedience, but that our obedience (or lack thereof) reveals those who truly do and do not believe.  Before one jumps to this text, we must ask what it is to 'abide' in Christ.  For it is this 'abiding in Christ' that causes good fruit to bear, or obedience to the commandments of God (here it is identified as loving one another, summing up the whole law--John 15:12).  We must simply state the indicative (who we are in Christ) is assumed when speaking of the imperative (obeying Christ).  If we abide in Christ through faith alone, then we will produce those good fruits.  If we do not abide in Chrsit through faith alone, then we will not produce good fruits.  If we do not produce those good fruits, then it is evident we are not abiding in Christ through faith.  I am not going to state performing good works is the basis of receiving and maintaing his love.  We cannot say the reward of eternal life is based upon our personal obedience, but Christ's alone.  This does not mean our personal obedience does not play a role (forgive the double negative).  However, the sole ground and reason we obtain the promise of the CoG, eternal life, is the finished work of CHrist.  Our obedience merely testifies to our resting in Christ.  Our obedience is necessary for salvation.  It simply is not the grounds of our salvation.  This is a matter of ensuring the indicative always precedes the imperative.\n\nText 2:That's right...

Here's my blow by blow summary of what happened on the second leg of the race. This week's picture album totally sucked, with no pictures of the tango detour. Very queerly, 50% of the pictures were of the foam party at te 'Shake' place,when on TV they only spent 5 mins there. The poster of the photographs was also crazy, cause Kami & Karli have so many pics when Bob & Joyce have none...  Ok, so you know they were in Uruguay when they stopped. They received the clue to go to the pub 'Shake' in the Uraguaian downtown. The little lady went the wrong way, which I was absolutely pissed at cause Brandon & Nicole were right there for them to follow. The bowling moms surprised me with their navigation skills as they took over Alison & Donny to reach the pub first. Meanwhile, Charla & Mirna chanced upon a hooker!  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to Charla about the hooker): She's pissed now cause we're talking to her when she's got business to do.         And so the teams reached the pub one by one. Brandon & Nicole were the ones victimised by the task, with Nicole getting squeezed in the context of trying to burst her beach ball. Ok... That sounds sick! Ok, yeah! She gets touched and shagged, and for a moment I thought the guy was going to rape her under the foam while Brandon minded his business with the balls. That sounds sick again! Ok... The creepy face in the picture is probably the molester...         From the part house they were supposed to go to the port to take a ferry to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Charla & Mirna missed the ferry. I mean if Charla was normal they'd have missed it. Again... MANIPULATION! The little lady actually used her disability to her advantage again. I have a feelin this is going to be the trend for as long as they are here. She is one power pack... Getting the ferry to wait for the 'Guest of Honour'. Go the little one!  They got to Argentina and had to go to Evita's resting place. It was a cemetery called Recoleta, but a few teams got the wrong cemetery, going to Chacarita, where Evita's Husband, the president, was buried. It is absolutely disrespectful of the producers to make the teams run into the cemetery like that. Oh, and Charla & Mirna caught a buggy which decided it would help a 'little lady'.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to buggy driver): Little lady here! Little lady here!  And the teams received a clue for the Detour. Yay! In tango, teams had to travel 1.5 miles on any preferred mode of transport to El Tango, where they would receive a picture of one of the dancers. Then, they would have to enter in a horribly lit, beautiful and atmospheric theatre, where a large number of people were doint the tango. Recognise the face. Very difficult in the dim light, but still easier than walking 8 unruly hounds 1 mile. That was of course in Perro! Teams had to deal with hyper active dogs that sometimes were overly horny for their own good. Only Kami & Karli and Bob & Joyce completed this task.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Alison to the dog): You can't keep having sex!         From there, the teams went to a cow farm. What's it with cows this time? First, slaughtered, bloody cows. Then now its alive and fast cows... Oh the irony! Anyway the roadblock clue read: 'The person that's doing this task must have fast hands and fast feet'.   Amazing Quote at this point(says Charla to Mirna): You may have to stick your hand up the cow's ass.  And anyway, the teams did not have to do that. all they had to do was get a bananda off the cow's neck. Luckily Charla didn't step up to stick her hand up the cow's ass cause she would have been trampled to death.         All the blah and teams had to go on a horse carraige to their next pit stop.        Oh yes... Did I mention that Alison and Donny were eliminated? What a shocker. I really don't know what to say after 2 most expected couples got eliminated first... *hums away*         Opinions and views on teams will be posted later tomorrow I kind of tired now... And there's school tomorrow. *Sighs*\n\nText 2:The Baghdad Blogger  After hearing so much about the Baghdad Blogger on  urlLink NPR , I finally decided to go check out  urlLink Salam Pax's Blog  for myself.

The following is the Message of His Holiness Pope John Paul II for the holy season of Lent, dated 8 December 2003, solemnity of the Immaculate Conception.   Dear Brothers and Sisters!   1. The evocative rite of the imposition of ashes marks the beginning of the holy season of Lent, when the Liturgy once more calls the faithful to radical conversion and trust in God's mercy.  This year's theme \u2014 'Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me' (Mt 18:5) \u2014 invites us to reflect on the condition of children. Today Jesus continues to call them to himself and to set them as an example to all those who wish to be his disciples. Jesus' words call upon us to see how children are treated in our families, in civil society and in the Church. They are also an incentive to rediscover the simplicity and trust which believers must cultivate in imitation of the Son of God, who shared the lot of the little ones and the poor. Saint Clare of Assisi loved to say that Christ 'lay in a manger, lived in poverty on the earth and died naked on the Cross' (Testament, Franciscan Sources, n. 2841).  Jesus had a particular love for children because of 'their simplicity, their joy of life, their spontaneity and their faith filled with wonder' (Angelus Message, 18 December 1994). For this reason he wishes the community to open its arms and its heart to them, even as he did: 'Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me' (Mt 18:5). Alongside children Jesus sets the 'very least of the brethren': the suffering, the needy, the hungry and thirsty, strangers, the naked, the sick and the imprisoned. In welcoming them and loving them, or in treating them with indifference and contempt, we show our attitude towards him, for it is in them that he is particularly present.  Learn to follow the Master with childlike docility  2. The Gospel recounts the childhood of Jesus in the simple home of Nazareth, where he was obedient to his parents and 'increased in wisdom and in years, and in favour with God and man' (Lk 2:52). By becoming himself a child, he wished to share our human experience. 'He emptied himself', writes the Apostle Paul, 'taking the form of a slave, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a Cross' (Phil 2:7-8). When at 12 years old he remained in the Temple in Jerusalem, he said to his parents who anxiously looked for him: 'How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?' (Lk 2:49). Indeed, his whole life was marked by a trusting and filial obedience to his heavenly Father. 'My food', he said, 'is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work' (Jn 4:34).  In the years of his public life Jesus often insisted that only those who become like children will enter the Kingdom of Heaven (cf. Mt 18:3; Mk 10:15; Lk 18:17; Jn 3:3). In his teaching, young children become a striking image of the disciple who is called to follow the divine Master with childlike docility: 'Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven' (Mt 18:4).  'To become' one of the least and 'to receive' the little ones: these are two aspects of a single teaching which the Lord repeats to his disciples in our time. Only the one who makes himself one of the 'least' is able to receive with love the 'least' of our brothers and sisters.  Combat the many forms of injustice present in the world  3. Many believers strive faithfully to follow these teachings of the Lord. Here I would mention those parents who willingly take on the responsibility of a large family, mothers and fathers who, rather than considering success in their profession and career as the highest value, make every effort to pass on to their children those human and religious values that give true meaning to life.  With great admiration I also think of all those committed to caring for underprivileged children and those who alleviate the sufferings of children and their families resulting from war and violence, inadequate food and water, forced immigration and the many forms of injustice present : in the world.  Together with such great generosity, however, a word must be said about the selfishness of those who do not 'receive' children. There are young people who have been profoundly hurt by the violence of adults: sexual abuse, forced prostitution, involvement in the sale and use of drugs; children forced to work or enlisted for combat; young children scarred forever by the break-up of the family; little ones caught up in the obscene trafficking of organs and persons. What too of the tragedy of AIDS and its devastating consequences in Africa? It is said that millions of persons are now afflicted by this scourge, many of whom were infected from birth. Humanity cannot close its, eyes in the face of so appalling a tragedy.  We need a greater concern for the needs of children  4. What evil have these children done to merit such suffering? From a human standpoint it is not easy, indeed it may be impossible, to answer this disturbing question. Only faith can make us begin to understand so profound an abyss of suffering. By becoming 'obedient unto death, even death on a Cross' (Phil 2:8), Jesus took human suffering upon himself and illuminated it with the radiant light of his resurrection. By his death, he conquered death once for all.  During Lent, we prepare to relive the Paschal Mystery, which sheds the light of hope upon the whole of our existence, even its most complex and painful aspects. Holy Week will again set before us this mystery of salvation in the suggestive rites of the Easter Triduum.  Dear Brothers and Sisters, let us set out with trust on our Lenten journey, sustained by fervent prayer, penance and concern for those in need. In particular, may this Lent be a time of ever greater concern for the needs of children, in our own families and in society as a whole: for they are the future of humanity.  With childlike simplicity pray to the Father  5. With childlike simplicity let us turn to God and call him, as Jesus taught us in the prayer of the 'Our Father', 'Abba', 'Father'.  Our Father! Let us repeat this prayer often during Lent; let us repeat it with deep emotion. By calling God 'Our Father', we will better realize that we are his children and feel that we are brothers and sisters of one another. Thus, it will be easier for us to open our hearts to the little ones, following the invitation of Jesus: 'Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me' (Mt 18:5).  In this hope, I invoke upon each of you God's Blessings, through the intercession of Mary, Mother of the Word of God made man and Mother of all humanity.\n\nText 2:well, i guess  Gandalf's  picks didn't work out yesterday.  props to the  Patriots  and  Panthers'  defense, they tore it up.  music practice was dope, we haven't practiced like that in a while. props to  fred  for setting it up.  lets rock HSS!! well thats all for now, have a great day everyone!"], "gold_label": 1.0}

With most of its citizens having gone inactive, the fate of Slobovia has been questioned abroad. Slobovia, which has been declining in activity since it seceded from the Arminian Community over two months ago, culminated in its slow-down with the announcement by President Troy Thompson that the nation would be 'making serious changes'. These revolved around Mr. Thompson's own departure, albeit temporary, from micronations for an unspecified amount of time.  This prompted Kaiser Von Wulf, at one time a Slobovian himself, to speak with President Thompson about the future of the Slobovians. As it would turn out, Mr. Thompson was seeking a friendly state of similar interests to establish a protectorate over Slobovia while he is away. Such a protectorate would have to, of course, guarantee the territorial integrity of the nation and make assurances that upon the return of the President, Slobovia be allowed to determine its own future. Von Wulf has made these assurances and has entered into stronger negotiations with Thompson in order to finalise the deal.  These negotiations are continuing and are expected to culminate in a formal protectorate treaty being signed between the two nations and Slobovia becoming the Panzermannsch Protectorate of Slobowien within the next few weeks. More information on this event will be posted as it becomes available.\n\nText 2:He slipped away into the nowhere that hummed around the edges of everthing.   ~Michael Cunningham - 'Flesh and Blood'"], "gold_label": 0.0}

I had put my blood, sweat, and tears into planning a great networking/social event at Second City (a legendary comedy club here in Chi) for my grad school alumni, and what did I do to celebrate?  I got plowed with the Dean of the business school.  When he made a speech and asked me to stand up to be recognized for my hard work on the board of directors, I remember the act of standing up felt like an extremely daunting task.  * Just when my addiction to cable had gotten to the point where I actually considered a 12-step program, it was cut off.  Completely.  No more cable, free or paid for.  I guess I'll have to take up needlepoint or something, cuz I'm not quite sure what I'll do with all this additional free time.  * I got suckered into attending a SOLD OUT  urlLink Rick Springfield  show tonight.  I know he's a chachi, but that point is probably moot.  I'll make sure to throw a pair of my chonies up on stage, along with the 40+ women who will likely be in that crowd.  * Famous last words: 'Let's go up to your place so we can cuddle.'  [For those too naive to know, when a guy says he just wants to 'cuddle' (whether he just met you or otherwise), he just wants sex.  Or at least a dry humping session.  I am not one of those who is too naive to not know this.  Neither is my friend T.]  * My life could dramatically change by this time next week.  I will let you know if that happens.  And now...the Friday 5.   1. What food do you like that most people hate?  I really like to dip carrots in peanut butter.  A lot of people give me grossed out looks when I do that.  How is that so different from putting celery in peanut butter?  Could someone please explain?   2. What food do you hate that most people love?  I'm OK with sushi rolls (particularly wimpy California rolls), but I hate all other sushi.  It's funny, because when I'm in NY, everyone always wants to go out for sushi.  When I tell them that's not my cup of tea, I ALWAYS get this same response: 'You don't like sushi?  But you  look  like you would like sushi.'  I  look  like I would like sushi??  What does that even mean?  Is it my hairstyle?  My shoes?  My bra size?  I am dumbfounded.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?  Someone must think Britney Spears is good-looking.  Otherwise, she'd stop making her slutty videos and selling her crap music.  Personally, I think she looks like a damn carnie.  Her legs are kind of squat-like, but I suppose her short skirt/high boot outfit combo doesn't help give the illusion of longer legs.  Someone needs to tell her to stop wearing that shit.   4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?  It used to be Bachelor Bob, until I realized he was as big a tool as any other guy out there.  There, I've said it.  Bob's a pig.  But to answer the question, I think  urlLink Sarah Polley  is unbelievably gorgeous.  She has an average-girl look to her, but when she's on-screen, she shines.     5. What popular trend baffles you?  PDAs.  Don't like 'em.  Won't get one.  Don't try to convince me otherwise. (Granted, I also said that about cell phones at one point, and now I'm a total cell phone whore.)\n\nText 2:Here we go...    1. What is your favorite time of year?  I have an appreciation for all the seasons.  But I typically like the first part of each one.  For instance, I look forward to the leaves changing and the first snowfall, but after awhile I get sick of the same-old and Im waiting for the next change.  This is why I couldnt live in California.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   Lets just consider this the Friday Four.   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Um the end of each season.  Maybe the Friday Three?   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   Friday Two?   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   I love, love, love being lakeside on a beautiful summer day.  Like the Duf, I also enjoy swinging a golf club.  And I love bundling up and taking a walk at night, right after a big snowfall (as long as its not -20).  Nothing like the sound of crunching snow under the feet."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Yeah, not only is the bumper sticker 'a bit over the line', but it's completely backwards.&nbsp; BUSH is Bin Laden's man.&nbsp; The Bushes are the ones with the close ties to the Bin Ladens.&nbsp; As Michael Moore tells anyone that cares to listen, BUSH is the one with the many personal and financial&nbsp;ties to the Bin Laden family&nbsp;and the Saudi Royal family:  &nbsp;   The Bin Ladens have had business relations with Bush and his family for 25 years.In 1977 Dubya got financing for his oil business 'Arbusto' from his Texas Air National Guard (AWOL buddy) James A. Bath.&nbsp; (The name you saw blacked out in Fahrenheit 9/11).&nbsp; James A. Bath had been hired by Osama's brother, Salem bin Laden, to invest the bin Laden's money, and so $50,000 (5% of control of Arbusto) came from Mr. Bath.  Dubya's father, number 41, is a highly paid consultant for the Carlyle Group, and one of the investors in Carlyle was the bin Laden family.&nbsp; Dubya, until 1994, headed a company called CaterAir, which was owned by Carlylye.     All this was happening when the bin Laden's not only had NOT cut their ties to Osama, but they continued to fund him, and continue to this day, as they have been doing for years.   The Taliban was invited to Texas (WHILE THEY WERE HIDING OSAMA) so Unocal could talk them into letting it build a pipeline through Afghanistan.&nbsp; At this time Dubya met with the Uzbek ambassador on behalf of ENRON's 'Kenny Boy' Lay (last seen taken away in handcuffs).&nbsp; But after Al Qaeda blew up our African embassies it was clear that Clinton was not going to let Bush's friends at Unocal, Halliburton, and Enron do their pipeline business with terrorists.&nbsp; So a new regime was needed, and corrupt Enron became one of the biggest contributors to Bush's corrupt campaign.    BUSH hindered the hunt for Bin Laden; he:&nbsp;  &nbsp; 1) Took the pressure off Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban by focusing our troops on the Iraq distraction.  &nbsp;&nbsp;2) Sent a severely underpowered military force to Afghanistan, and was consequently unable to catch any of the Taliban or al&nbsp;Qaida bigwigs.  &nbsp; 4) Allowed hundreds of Saudis to be flown out of the country on 9/13, where they couldn't be properly interrogated by the authorities.&nbsp;  &nbsp; 5) Never put any pressure on his Saudi buddies to actually cooperate with our 9/11 investigations&nbsp;(But that's not surprising, Bush and the White House have not been cooperating with the 9/11 investigation, either - I especially love how Dubya couldn't testify alone, he had to bring along his boss, Cheney.)   BUSH has helped Al Qaeda more than Bin Laden&nbsp;could have hoped for in his wildest dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;   After the unnecessary Iraq war, and the Abu Graib disgrace (the worst is yet to come on that) - Al Qaeda recruiting is up worldwide.&nbsp; I think we all know who Bin Laden would vote for.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that Bin Laden definitely wants Bush to win -&nbsp;Bush could hardly be doing a better job of&nbsp;playing into Bin Laden's plans to unite Muslim countries against the West and&nbsp;build up enough anger to overthrow US-friendly Arab governments.  &nbsp;  BUSH IS BIN LADEN'S MAN.   Bush is such a good friend to the Saudis and the bin Ladens that he is incapable and unwilling to take on Al Qaeda and its money trail that leads directly to his close friends and business partners.&nbsp; This is a flagrant conflict of interests, and it's obvious that, by trying to have it both ways, to take on Al Qaeda while not offending his Saudi buddies, Bush is not on our side.&nbsp; A wise man once said that you're either with us or you're with the terrorists - and Bush is with the terrorists.&nbsp;   So the Republicans ignore this.&nbsp; They have something Kerry doesn't have, a lot of fucking nerve.&nbsp; How else can they criticize a man who earned a purple heart in Vietnam and had the courage and foresight to condemn the war upon his return, and laud&nbsp;the man who was AWOL snorting coke off of mexican whores during the war, then bumbled his way into the presidency where he's currently doing his best to&nbsp;give us all another Vietnam.

God, wake us up.  ****  I'm starting to lose sense of my vision for this site, since it's become just another 'blog.'  I should have written it a long time ago, but haven't yet written the purpose for this site.  I came up with an idea to do a web journal depicting the experience of a guy with a christian mindset/worldview during freshman year, after seeing my roommate maintain his own online journal.  And this was back in the beginning in 1999, before many normal people had an inkling to do this sort of thing.  Ah, oh well.  What I'm trying to say is, I'm starting to get tired of updating.  I'm looking at this past year, and found that the only thing this site has done is function as a venting station for my frustrations and childish whims for attention, and it's taken a lot of my time that should have been spent studying and doing research, or petitioning God to beat me upside the head to see what I should really pursue in life.  Do I stick with BME?  I find myself more ambivalent about my coursework, about any sort of research, and it scares me... I'd rather love it, or detest it, but ambivalence has driven me to have no motivation to study and do my duty, my 'tentmaking.'  What else could I possibly go into?  I'm a jack of all trades, but a master of none.  I can learn things, many different things very quickly, but only at an amateur level because of this easily distracted mind.

Haha!  Random thoughts lately: 1. When watching mice in our experimental animal facility, I've noticed that all they ever do is... (a) eat, (b) copulate, (c) fight.  Which, to me, represents the animalistic side of life... or the Lockean state of nature.  For mice, it's just that simple.  I'm glad that for us, there's more to this life than living and dying, more than just trying to make it though the day (SC Chapman).  2. Male mice force female mice to copulate, and females always run away at first.  Why isn't it the other way around, like, females going after the males? And why don't they both go after each other?  Does it physically hurt the females or what? Hmmm?  3.  The pre-believers in my lab exhibit some similar traits: (a) they swear a lot, (b) they're not truly/madly/deeply loving to one another, (c) and they lie casually.  Part (c) is what completely throws me off because I assume people are always telling me the truth, but they lie about the darndest stuff.  4.  I have this feeling that God is going to do something amazing at my company.  He's placed faithful believers in key areas of the Institute.  We have a believers in maintenance, finance, and dispersed throughout the labs.  Sweet!  5.  Even though I need to use mice for my experiments, I never want to lose compassion for them.  It's easy to do that in this job, and numbing oneself to their pain makes the job easier.  But, I don't want to harden my heart to them ever.  I will definitely do my job well, but I always want to hurt when they hurt.\n\nText 2:urlLink Ben Stein's take on Hollywood.

So, situation normal there.  Scott said that once we get into our new house and get settled et al, that I am never working nights again.  I think he vacillates between awe at how I function on so little sleep so chronically, and worry that I'm either going to just keel over or fall asleep behind the wheel or something.  Really I can go for weeks and months on like two, three hours sleep a day.  The problem is that I'm not using all that extra time productively.  I have, however, been knitting as much as my hand will allow.  It's best for like half hour or so, then a break.  I am feeling the pressure to get it done-I have the whole back and front to do, so I feel like every minute I have to be working on it.  I decided to withdraw from school because I'm just not doing it.  I'm way behind and I am not in the mindset to do it.  I refuse to feel guilty about it-it's just not something my heart is in.  All the priorities are in a different place right now.  Plus, with all this education they are putting us through at work, how much available space do I actually have in my brain?  I am definitely going up to the temple this weekend.  I was going to go for a few days, remember, but I just don't think it's a good idea with all this medication I'm still taking and all the precautions I have to take with keeping my hand clean and stuff (not that it's dirty up there, because it isn't).  Just that doing everything I need to do is easier done from here.  For the longest time I was looking for an Indian tiffin container.  This is like a series of three metal containers, small round containers, that all stack and fit into a carrier.  Like a lunchbox.  But it has seperate containers for different things.  Well, I couldn't find one, not even on Ebay, which has God knows everything.  But I found something better that's made by Thermos Nissan.  Is this the same Nissan that makes cars? Who knows.  Anyway, they are making like steel Thermos bottles and so on and they have this one that has four round containers that fit into a steel thermos and it's supposed to keep things hot for 12 hours or cold for 24.  So this will be nice for bringing home prasadam from the temple for Scott, or when I go up and spend time there.  Tonight I was watching some DVDs of Srila Prabhupada.  My conception of him is fuzzy, only from books and lectures and photographs, but to see him moving and interacting with people and speaking, is really amazing.  He was so confident always without being arrogant, just very convinced of the reality of his words.  He seemed to be very strong yet very delicate at the same time-sometimes the camera man would focus on his hands and you can see there, like when he played the karatals, that his touch was both strong yet very precise and delicate.  It was fun to see him with the children.  Some people believe that only Srila Prabuhpada should be the guru.  This idea, caled rtvik theory, has been a major source of controversy within our community.  I don't usually talk about things like this here, but I can say pretty openly that I don't buy into it.  It doesn't make sense to me.  How can a society grow and continue to grow if the succession is broken?  The disciplic succession has been going on for thousands and thousands of years.  We see that Srila Prabhupada's guru was Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, and so on back down the line.  This is the disciplic succession.  My guru, HH Indradyumna Swami, is a disciple of Srila Prabuhpada.  It just continues in this way.  Of course Srila Prabhupada is very special, because he brought Krsna Consciousness to the west and founded our Society.  He is like a grandfather to us, grand-guru, and we are grand-disciples.  Of course he holds a special place.  But that doesn't mean that everything should stop there.  Of course it has to continue on.  I think that people need to be very aware though, and use a lot of discretion and serious thought and prayer when seeking for the guru.  It's very easy to be cheated and misled, so we have to approach this very carefully.  All the scriptures say that we should examine the guru very carefully before accepting him (or her) and that the guru should do the same for the disciple.  In this way we can be sure that we are getting the bonafide real deal.  Prayer is a very big part of it, because when Krsna sees that we are serious about spiritual life, He sends the guru to us.  Actually, the guru is a manifestation of Krsna Himself.  When you are serious about learning about spiritual life and ready to commit to it, Krsna Himself comes to you in the form of the guru to guide you back home.  So you need to pray very sincerely about it.  Some people go for years or a whole lifetime without ever finding their guru.  I didn't have this experience-the first time I got to the temple, my spiritual master was there waiting.  So everyone's experience is very different.  I think I am more the exception than the rule, because most people take several years with it at the least.  I think that westerners in general have a problem with authority, accepting authority.  We don't like to do it.  Everyone wants to be the boss.  Unfortunately, that mentality only leads to more problems.  The only way to learn anything is to first of all admit you don't know, and then to listen and do what your teacher says.  This goes with anything, not just spiritual life.  Like when I was in nursing school, you had to watch someone do a procedure.  Then when you tried to do it, you were watched, and corrected if necessary.  You couldn't just go in and say, 'oh, I know how to do that', when you didn't.  Even now if there is a procedure I don't know how to do, I call someone or find someone to show me how.  If I was too proud or arrogant to do that, I could potentially hurt someone through my ignorance.  So spiritual life is the same way.  First you have to admit you don't know.  Then you have to find someone who does know, and that's the guru.  Then you say to the guru, okay, I don't know, so please teach me, and I will listen and do what you tell me to do.  That's what it's all about.  The problem for many people comes when guru says, don't do this, don't do that.  Like guru might say, OK, if you are serious about spiritual life, no intoxication.  People think, oh no! I have to give up drinking? and they don't want to do it.  Or illicit sex.  People don't want to give it up.  Then they turn around and say, oh, this must be a cult, it's very restrictive, trying to tell me what to do with my personal life.  But they're not realising, they wanted to learn about spiritual life, well, this is how it gets done.  You can't just have your cake and eat it too.  And most people don't even realise how things they do are actually detrimental to them.  Or they do realise but they just don't care because they want to 'enjoy' in the moment.  Intelligent people, though, will stop and understand, and obey what the guru says, and later on when they get a little bit more realisation and understanding, they can say, yes, I can understand now that this is something for my own good, although it seems like an austerity, really it makes my life easier and better.  So all these things we do, like giving up meat, fish, eggs, intoxication, illicit sex, all of this at first seems like a terrible trial and austerity.  But later on we can realise that it makes life so much easier, and we are better for it.  And if we know something about other religions or the history of religion, we can also understand that these things are not unusual.  In fact, most serious religious practice will enjoin these same things to one degree or another.  It's just that most people aren't really serious about following religious practice.  Well, I'm not sure how understandable that all was, so if you have any questions, just ask.  In a few weeks I am going to give a talk at the college in a class on religion that a friend of mine is taking.  I'm really looking forward to it.  It's something I've never done before so I am really relishing the opportunity.  Thank goodness I am used to speaking in front of people so I won't be nervous.

I admit I probably have gotten sucked into the media hype surrounding him, but there's a reason so many girls think Bob's the ideal man (or at least  seems  to be).  He's  not  perfect.  Not even close.  He's clumsy, sensitive, and hilarious.  He's divorced.  He has a goofy haircut.  He doesn't have tons of money.  This makes him seem accessible to most girls out there.  When a middle-of-the-road woman looks at a man like Bob, she probably thinks 'Hey, even I'd have a chance with that guy.'    On the other hand, all the other Bachelors in the past were the exact opposite.  They were rich, arrogant, too-good-looking clowns that were just looking for a hot piece of ass.

Lucky him.  I have found out how bees have sex, read below:  The mating flight follows a pattern. The virgin queen flies to a congregation area where hundreds or thousands of unrelated drones await. The drones pursue the queen and several mate with her in flight. The drone mounts the queen, inserts his endophallus, and ejaculates his semen. During ejaculation, the male falls back and his endophallus is ripped out of his body and remains attached to the queen. Drones mounting later remove the previous drone's endophallus and lose their own through similar matings. The emasculated drones die very quickly with their abdomens burst in this fashion.   Um, interesting. And if you could see the diagrams I do then you shall see that the male bee looses his stinger. I wonder then if they do actually sting each other?

Last night leaving 'the last samurai' with KE some asshole in a Rav4 (or equivalent) was hauling ASS through the parking lot, people weren't quite jumping out of the way, but it was clear he wasn't slowing down/stopping for anyone.  Well, he just so happened to have to slow down to round a corner and get by my walking ass.  Well, he cut it really close, so what did I do,  stick out my keys.  Heh.  I intentionally didn't try and get his car, but it was more of a gesture for the 15 other people he was trying to plow through.  Well, Mr. Big Bad Ass driver didn't think it was funny, so he slammed his brakes and got out of the car.  For some unknown reason my first response was to start walking towards him and say 'I didn't get it asshole, get back in your car'.   LOL.  I'd have to confirm with KE but this guy out-weighed me by probably 100 lbs, and about 6'.  Kept walking towards him saying 'look, look' pointing accusingly.  I guess this guy must've felt stupid or something b/c he got back in his car and left,  and I dont think he said one word.    So, that was story one.  Here is story two.  Lunch at the local mexican place.  There are two registers serving customers.  Ok, *every* time I've *ever* been there (approaching 100 times) one cue forms, and you simply take whichever register is first.  Common courtesy in large line venues IMO.  Well, I'm next in line, and some dude comes charging over to register two - right in front of me.  So, I inform him that there's a line, and he needs to  get in it.  He gets all confrontational with me saying, 'Well I'm gonna make you choose, which line you gonna be in', and my response 'I choose this one line that everyone else is in, and you're going to get behind me again'.  Well, we went back and forth like that for about 20-30 seconds, and I stopped him mid-sentence and said 'You know what, I'm gonna let YOU be the asshole today - go ahead dick'.   Heh.  Apparently he didn't like being called a dick, and protested some.  Net net net, he ordered his food, I winked at him when he went to pick it up - the register ladies saw the whole thing go down, and as a net result, I got my food first.  The question is, what IS it with people like that?  The assholes that are in such a fucking rush that they just try and run you over, or cheat to get ahead any way possible?  I don't consider myself a particularly violent person, but when people go out of their way to act like dicks, I call them on it.  Worse more, these people are all show and no go.  The guy from the movie was MUCH bigger than me, and backed down.  I stood up to the chin on the guy at lunch today, and he had me by a good 60 lbs probably - and he didn't do shit, even after I called him names in front of a bunch of people.  Again, maybe it's just me being a dick, but the last 24 hours have been entertaining at the least."], "gold_label": 1.0}

That's hilarious about your NKOTB stuff, and I can't wait to see you in the t-shirt!  Well, my day yesterday was weird. Not bad, just weird. There was a string of things that just didn't quite go right and there was nothing I could do about it. That's when you just shrug your shoulders and chalk it up as a weird day. I was supposed to go to lunch with someone and they forgot. I went to pick up my contacts and they weren't in yet (been wearing my glasses for a week). Talked on the phone with someone and I knew they were frustrated and I didn't know what to do to help. Oh, well. Mama said there would be days like that!  There were some bright spots in the day, however, and they outshone the weirdness!! My women's Life Group in the morning went really well. I'm enjoying our study and there are two gals I'm getting to know better. It's been just wonderful! Then last night we had our couples small group. That group is always a riot; we laugh so much! I had a chance to chat briefly with one of the gals in the couples group who has been wrestling through some issues with her faith. I had been wanting to chat with her because I had a hunch that she was walking a path similar to one Ked and I walked a few years ago. Last night I mentioned a few things and her eyes lit up with relief that she wasn't the only one. It felt good to offer her some encouragement and let her know she's not alone. When we left, she hugged me and Ked tightly.  I was exhausted by the time we got home after Life Group and it didn't take long to fall asleep! Today, it looks like the sun is shining. I feel like a swim!\n\nText 2:So, I finally got to register for classes. It's been close before, but I don't think I've ever done the day of classes.

After dozens upon dozens of seconds, I've come to a few conclusions:   1. Subway Takes Themselves WAY Too Seriously   Example:  To promote their new ground-breaking chicken sandy (chicken between bread with cheese), they use the slogan  Mediterranean Chicken Experience .  In the past, I have only heard/used this term in reference to getting railed by a Greek sailor.  (Myknos, call me!)  If they are referring to the 'experience' of smelling their bread from a 10 block radius, then standing in a long line of 9-5ing zombies until the Middle-Easterner clad in rubber gloves looks you up and down, licks his lips, and asks you if you want 'Pickles', then yes, I have 'experienced' your sandwich.   2.  Jared Needs to Gain All the Weight Back and Die   I cannot tell you how sick of this douche I am.  Here's another example of me meeting an idol of mine, and getting it slapped right back in my face.  I happened upon 'Jared' at the American Idol auditions in New York (don't ask).  The man is still pretty pudgy, greezy, and so pocked he makes Edward James Olmos' whiffled noggen look like Liv Tyler in Lord of the Rings.  Moreover, he completely ignored me.    And now their promoting this healthy bullshit to kids?  Their latest campaign has Jared shilling to children about the risks of becoming a grown-up Jared.

In addition to the new cellphone thing, I cleaned my room, and did some drawing.  Now playing:  Anti-Flag  - Turncoat  I want to rant on television sensationalism. I was watching NBC 4 News and they had a really stupid story about a Japanese study on how women who eat eggs daily have a higher risk of dying than women who eat eggs a couple times a week (or less). That was such a shitty job of reporting. They didn't talk about what women were dying of, or the demographics of the study. How old were these women who were dying? And of cancer? heart attacks? The stupid story just basically said that women who eat a lot of eggs have a higher risk of dying.   The real story behind the report is that over a 14 year and 9,300 person study in Japan, researchers found a difference in cholesterol levels (3%). However, were inconclusive about the link between eggs themselves and the deaths, because the deaths in the sample were not necessarily heart attacks or strokes. There was only the 22% increased likelihood that the women would who ate an egg a day would die of any cause compared with those who ate only a couple eggs per week.   Now playing:  NOFX  - Flossing a Dead Horse  The correlation between the deaths and eggs is really weak. The sad thing is that the world is full of stupid people, and they'll just think that eggs will kill you.  TV news is just absurd... the most absurd of them all is FOX News. Bill O'Reilly is the ultimate sensationalist. The guy's ranted to a 9/11 victim's family member, and ranted on Carson Daly having a tattoo (that's supposed to be in honor of his father). The guy's invited government officials from other countries onto his show, and not let them speak. He claims that there's no spin to his show too, and people are dumb enough to believe him.

From sleep, I passed through the dreamless state and entered Dreamland. The place where we enjoy ourselves and relive our deepest desires, survive our worst nightmares and well, to cut a MELODRAMATIC story short, it's a place where what happens there, generally stays there and we don't give it much thought in our waking hours.  Anyhow, last night, I had a dream which I felt was... weird [My kingdom for a more eloquent word!]. More interestingly, it was centered around a particular person. She-who-shall-not-be-named. God I feel stupid using that. Damn you J.K. Rowling. For the purpose of displaying the abnormality of the dream, I had another one just last week centered around the same general idea. I'll explain in order of sequence [or what I think is the sequence in which they occured].   Last night, the dream was of me. Standing alone in a dimly lit carpark where I was by myself. Wearing funky clothes too mind you. All of a sudden, she walks up to me and for no rhyme or reason I said 'Kiss me' [When I woke, I thought about the stupidity of the statement and just wondered why I said, of all things, that. Not even a greeting or a pleasantry. A simple two words]. Here's the clincher. She did. Oh, sure it happened in a dream, but I'm surprised that my mind, despite my wild imagination and twisted thought processes, could come up with that. I was [in my dream] understandably confused as to why she did and proceeded to ask her about her boyfriend.  'He never loved me, he just used me [Nb. Here I cringed in my dream and felt a stab through my heart. Emotional knife 101] and I don't know why I ever loved him... I should never have taken you for granted and I'm so sorry about that, would you ever forgive me?'  Well. Um. Here, I say 'I don't know... I've got a lot of questions I need answering. Like why did we -break- in the first place.'  'You never show how much you cared [Nb. b-u-l-l-s-h-i-t. I think, in the real world, I displayed how much I cared for her enough. I think. But that led me, upon waking, to realise the dream was complete and utter horseshit.] and we could never see each other... I didn't want to be ditched for someone else; you know me... I don't like being ditched and I thought I had to ditch you first.'  'Fine. But you do know that I would've waited for you forever and ever if it came down to it... And you just had to tell me how you felt. That's all you had to do hun [eh wtf.]...'  And then more hugging and reconcilation and we kiss again.  So that was the dream last night.  The dream the previous week, was one where you [this is to Chris and Jana], her and I were on a double date. We were walking along Collins Street, in the city, and it was just like old times. More laughing and smiling. And everyone was happy; nothing in the world was wrong and it couldn't have been more perfect. Chris and Jana were in the front, walking and holding hands with each other [as they always fucking do] and here and I were up the back whispering sweet-nothings to each other, her head resting on my shoulder.   Now, I don't know about what you think. But here and now, I solemnly swear that I have no more emotions [at least not in that way] for the girl. Sure, I think about her at night [but hey, I even think about randoms] but I don't think it'd be anything abnormal. Honestly, tell me you've never thought about relationships long past at night whilst lying in bed and just reminscing.   And on both occasions, I woke up, scratching my head and thinking I have the most fucked up mind anyone is in possession of. Of all the people to dream about, I dreamt about... her.\n\nText 2:I had planned on having some discussion about 'reduction' and the like  urlLink before , but unfortunately formatting problems intervened.&nbsp; As such, it was dropped.&nbsp; I would have some quotes and such as well here, but not going to run the risk again.   Instead, I will just direct y'all over to some commentary.&nbsp; The article in question, from the New York Times Magazine, refers to the 'reduction' procedure.&nbsp; This is where, in a pregnancy with multiple....well, what is the right term?&nbsp; Children?&nbsp; Fetuses?&nbsp; Entities?&nbsp; Globs of cells?....are narrowed down.&nbsp; In this case, there were three of these...entities, and two were 'reduced.'&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; As the article author puts it (she is writing about her own experience), ' ...now I'm going to have to move to Staten Island. I'll never leave my house because I'll have to care for these children. I'll have to start shopping only at Costco and buying big jars of mayonnaise. '   You know, these deep moral concerns we all have of&nbsp;being stuck going&nbsp;to that sixth circle of Hell, Costco.   Needless to say, this has been the cause for much discussion in certain circles.&nbsp; An online article about it can be found  urlLink here .&nbsp; Within the blogopshere, other comments come from  urlLink Mirror of Justice  (specifically,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) and NRO's The Corner ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ).   I won't spend much time on this one.&nbsp; Others have said these things far better than I could.&nbsp; And, indeed the whole abortion matter is exceptionally divisive (as the audience thinks, 'no kidding, Einstein').&nbsp; I remember a friend of mine and I getting into a heated argument over this (neither of us is exactly a huge fan of abortion, Catholics both, but the debate was on how much this one issue should decide one's vote.&nbsp; As my friend said, 'It's just so big, you can't think about it' [or some such], and all I could respond was, 'It is so big, and I can't help but think about it' [or some such])(yeah, verbatim stuff here - glad I didn't go into journalism).   But, in any case, this is disturbing.&nbsp; Life and death determined by the convenience of someone else.&nbsp; A fundamental right for one as the basis for removing all rights, and possibility of rights, from another.   Let's be reductivist for a minute, here.&nbsp; After all, one of the major elements in the abortion controversy is religion.&nbsp; Can make arguments bloody difficult sometimes - apparently, being a converted Catholic means that any statement I make regarding abortion must be my insidious effort to move the US capitol to the Vatican and force all others to live under the yoke of papist oppression (or, if not argued quite so, simply enough done by 'keep your rosaries off my ovaries').&nbsp; So, let us consider the matter without religion.&nbsp; I won't enter in any ambiguous terminology about 'souls' or 'God' or any of that business, as long as the dear readers who disagree with me will also avoid such ambiguity.&nbsp; We will leave to the side dealing with the ambiguous term 'rights,' at least for the moment, as that would make things even more tricky.   Or, in other words, let us use 'relatively reliable methods of inquiry,' as that term is used by Gutmann and Thompson (two proponents of deliberative democracy theory) in their   urlLink Democracy and Disagreement  .&nbsp; Let's use methods we all could probably agree on.&nbsp; This is where we get reductivist.&nbsp; If we look at the matter biologically, when can one say an individual animal can be traced as originating?&nbsp; Certainly, not at birth - no mystical magical event happens in the birth canal taking a non-existing thing into an existing one.&nbsp; Something has been happening before.&nbsp; But when does the 'before' start?&nbsp; It must be before the third and second 'trimesters,' or else how could they be 'second' or 'third' anything?&nbsp; So, we must look to the first trimester.&nbsp; It would seem that the origins of an individual animal would be the beginning of such a trimester.&nbsp; That would be at or near conception.&nbsp; As a mere biological fact, life begins at conception.   So, what does that mean for our debate?&nbsp; One cannot say that the entity in the womb is a mere 'glob of cells' - it is either false (globs of cells don't go through the necessary developments of maturation) or truistic (everyone reading this is a glob of cells).&nbsp; So, we need to take another step.&nbsp; Where do life and rights coincide?&nbsp; Where there is life, are their rights?&nbsp; For we radical pro-lifers, the answer would be 'yes.'&nbsp; Therefore, abortion (barring extreme circumstances) is out.&nbsp; But, what if one says that life is necessary but not sufficient for rights?&nbsp; Well, then, what do rights connect with?&nbsp; Consciousness?&nbsp; Ah, but we have violated our rules at the beginning - we have entered in ambiguity, and we are no longer staying with 'relatively reliable methods of inquiry.'&nbsp; 'Consciousness' is a dreadfully problematic term, in many ways like 'soul' that way.&nbsp; Is 'consciousness' the ability to experience pain?&nbsp; Then apparently ants have rights.&nbsp; The same problem may arise if we say it is a creature with a certain preference set determined by desires - most higher animals would count (Fido, therefore, may be entitled to the vote).&nbsp; Is it some level of cognizant, voluntary motion?&nbsp; Depending on what 'cognizant' means, children under six months may not have rights.   Besides, why is 'consciousness' some great provider of right?&nbsp; For all we know, it may merely be epiphenomenal - a mere appearance brought on by a multiplicity of biochemical (or possibly quantum) activities in our gray matter, merely following the lines of determinate or probabilistic rules of nature.&nbsp; Why should that, then, be the standard for rights?   Why go through all this brickabrack?&nbsp; From a fear.&nbsp; Past experience illustrates that a society that limits the definition of 'human' to not include all human life is asking for moral horror.&nbsp; You don't need to agree with him to see how a Peter Singer can be totally consistent.&nbsp; By claiming some life is unworthy of life, or that some life has no right to existence, where does one draw the line without it being arbitrary?&nbsp; Where can one say 'this is too far,' having allowed the one 'reliable' method in a pluralistic society to be put to the side?   Yes, this article, and this issue, bothers me - can we feel secure in a society that will not give to its most helpless, faced with imposed death,&nbsp;the same protections as the most vicious murderer (trial, due process, counsel, appeals, execution by a duly appointed agent of the state rather than a private citizen)?&nbsp; Do we feel safe where existence can be ended on the decision of a private citizen?&nbsp; Can we feel justified, and morally sound, when we declare that the&nbsp;liberty of some outweigh absolutely the life and all liberties of others?&nbsp; I cannot feel safe, cannot feel secure, cannot feel justified or morally sound, nor&nbsp;reasonably assent to&nbsp;these things to myself, when faced with such a thing.   Existence should never be a capital offense.

What happened?   Yes  many times.  There are many categories for this.  First off, there are the times that someone tells you something private or secret about another person, and you know that they shouldnt be telling you.  An example would be Jane told me her deepest secret  want to hear what it is??  and it kills you that this person actually tells you.  There are also the times that friends make decisions that you wouldnt make, and all you can do is support them and shut up.  Something like, Im going to invest in Worldcom - I would rather just not know about it.  Yet a third type is when you are told something that puts you in a dilemma  to tell or not tell.  I really dont like those.  Dont tell Jane, but her car is getting towed or Dont tell Jane, but Im about to sleep with her dad.  Alright, so car towing doesnt usually create a morality crisis, but you get the idea.  In case you cant tell, Im not a fan of secrets.  Ignorance is bliss.   4.

Now and then.  Like, when I was microwaving dinner, or sorting laundry.\n\nText 2:ok im continuing the post from yetserday here, so read the next post first if you want it in the right order!  sat/sun was all wedding stuff.  monday night will/i couldnt go out late because we had to wake up early to take our wedding photos the next day!  but from what i remember, shirley had to work, so we delivered the sandwiches to my aunt's place- maybe that was when she took us out?  but anyway, our whole group met up that night for dinner at this place called ding tai fone- its supposedly world reknowned for their little pork dumplings.  there was CRAZY food! it just kept coming and coming! definitely fun.  i chatted with jason tobin- who plays virgil in betterluck tomorrow.  (him and the director justin lin were guests at the wedding too!).  jason has an english accent! i never would have guessed! and its funny, because man i was SO annoyed by his character in BLT, and i guess i had thought maybe he was like his character or something? yah so lame huh.. hes nothing like that.  hes way cool!  the first time i met him had been the night of the wedding and being so exhausted, i had gotten a real kick out of his accent.  i cant help it, little things really amuse me!  anyway, afterwards, we all took the subway (MRT) to this night market and shopped around and got shaved ice.  we all met up again at 1130pm and they made plans to go out, but me/will had to bail to get to sleep.  tuesday- all day spent taking photos.  so freakin' tiring! i had 3 changes.  will had it so easy! morning started out with hair and makeup.  omg was there a cakeload of makeup on me!  each dress had a different hair style too!  all in all, it was fun- but extremely exhausting.  got back to the hotel about 7ish i think.  hmm..what did we do that night.  dinner wise? i dont remember! but we went to mint that night- a club downstairs of 101 (taipei's new high rise of shopping/offices).  tuesday night its a lounge- we got a back like really cute room for our 15ish people.  drink drank drunk.  it was really fun!  got home maybe 3-4ish?  wednesday? thursday? friday? a blur!  i cant seem to remember what we did during the day...  wednesday night we went to a club called room18.  wednesday nights are ladies' nights for the clubs in taiwan, so they're HeLLa packed.  when we got there the line was SOO crazy long! luckily this guy we knew (david) knew the bouncer and got our whole group in without waiting in line! omg was this place packed.  can you say fire hazard! the music was good (although danG they kept replaying the same songs over and over again!). shirley/i had quite a number of smirnoff ice's - they things are deadly, you dont even realize how faded you are until its too late! lots of fun drinking/dancing.  i met this guy steven from the LA BOYz.  it was funny, cuz when my friend jesse said he was an LA BOYz, i thought he meant he was one of his LA Boyz, like one of his LA friends.  see i had been drinking a bit?  im pretty sure i've heard of LA Boyz, but just never heard any of their songs. anyway, by 230ish, i was pretty exhausted, and the party didnt look like it was slowing down any, so will and i headed back to the hotel while the others partied on.  thursday night? had dinner at 101- an italian restaurant no less!  i had lasagne.  the appetizers were really yummy!  then we all saw spiderman2 (which i fell asleep during! so exhausted!).  afterwards a bunch of us went to this lounge- champagne II, and well, drank! hehe.  they closed at 3 which at that time we went karaoking.  that was probably the most fun i've ever had karaoking. usually i hate it because people who generally want to go want to go to show off their singing skills- cuz you know they've been practicing like crazy just to do so.  that night was crazy fun because we were all in different varying degrees of faded-ness and we just had fun!  we were there till maybe 6ish?- at which point we went to this great 24hour dimsum breakfast place.  by 7ish we were back hanging out in the hotel lobby.    friday- i think we slept till like 2pm or something!  we went with some others to this electronic market- bought some random stuff like a usb thingee and cd cases.  then headed back to the hotel about 430ish and had pizza hut! yah its interesting, their dinner is like a buffet menu where you can try all their different types of pizza.  will ate one that was squid + fish eggs. gross.  afterwards shirley met up with us.  and we all congregated in our hotel room.  dinner was at this mala hot pot place.  luckily they split the pot into spicy/nonspicy.  then we headed back to mint- but we didnt have a table so we were just going to chill at the bar.  supposedly these places get crazy packed (which i've witnessed) and people book tables like weeks in advance!  luckily shirley knew some people who already had a table and through her magic we got our very own table- right next to the dance floor.  except RIGHT next to the speakers. i was yelling all night to talk.  crazy people though.  music was good too.  and yet again flowing alcohol.  i was still tired from the night before though, didnt feel that much like dancing.  wanted to go somewhere else!!  so lucky i am to have wonderful friends!  when i mentioned DANG it was loud and the dancing was making me tired, we had one more round of drinks and left the club.  we headed a few blocks to this lounge inhouse but they closed at 2 so we headed to this other lounge called 'brown sugar' that closed at 3.  more drinks.  some of the guys in our group fell asleep!  we left at 3ish and headed back to the hotel for the 'after after party' in our room.  what occurred/was discussed stays in that room!  around 5ish, some people left, and around 630 was the after after after party.  YAH can you say exhausted.  but crazy fun!  saturday and sunday are slightly blurry.  jesse became our new tour guide cuz shirley headed to china.  we went to this taiwan craftsmanship place and bought some souvenirs.  went to this hole in the wall really famous beef noodle soup place.  i think we browsed a mall too.  then we took the MRT to dan sui, which is northwest, next to the water.  its like a chinese promenade- just eh, not so clean.  lots of games, lots of food!  definite a fun experience.  crossed a few streets to get to a huge night market!  then our friend ed (who lives around there) picked us up in his m3 and drove us crazily fast back to taipei.  serious, i was experiencing the gforces!  definitely really exciting drive back! we also saw the little betelnut stands, where they have like these all window stands with bright neon lights and scantily clad women inside selling betel nuts.  supposedly you can uh-touch- them if you buy from them or something.  so that was interesting..anyway back at the hotel, we decided to take a mini nap to rest because we were planning on heading to this club plush that night.  ... it was about 10pm? ... no one made it out that night! we all were knocked out!  sunday- our last day!  we checked out of the hotel.  jesse took us to this great chinese breakfast place- soy milk king.  then we saw cute kitties!!  then to that electronic place where we browsed for chinese movies. we had lunch at jinghuachun's food court- wow its some food court.  any time of food you want they have it!  we had teppenyaki.  they were having some hip hop dance contest while we were there- called magic hiphop.  hehe, it was fun to watch.  then we saw puppies i think.  we stopped by my grandma's place for a while to get the stuff to bring back to my mom.  then jesse took us to this night market where we had teppanyaki again- this time for like less than half the price of what we paid at lunch, but just as good!  shopped around a bit before we headed to the airport. jesse was so great in showing us around and taking us all to the airport! definitely someone we're really glad we got to meet and hang out with. and the great part is, hes moving to west covina (from somewherein LA i dont remember).  yay!  GREAT trip.  i never would have thought it would be that fun.  i knew it would be fun, but WOW the amount of fun was mind boggling.  we are SO going back next year, with jesse/milan (hopefully) and stopping over in hong kong too!  whoohoo!!!  what was the topping on the cake was that i got to hang out with one of my very best friends for like a week straight!!  shirley was the best host i could EVER had asked for!!  we'll definitely have to return the favor!!!!    back to normal life.  gotta get back into it quickly!!"], "gold_label": 0.0}

So to start things off right, I thought we could discuss our unconventional crushes. Who do you have the hots for that isn't conventionally attractive or known as a sex symbol (we know all about your skeevy crushes, Leah)?   Anyone who knew me sophomore year of college was well aware that I had a raging crush on Hal Sparks, host of E's Talk Soup, now starring on Showtime's Queer as Folk...He also is incredibly funny on VH-1's I Love the '80 (and '70's). The obsssion was so out of control, all my Christmas presents that year were addressed as such:'To Alison, Love Hal' or maybe even 'Dear Alison, Hal Sparks cuts farts.' Yeah my parents are mature.    So I know Hal's not fly\u2013even for a white guy, but he's funny and that's what melts my butter. Too bad he likes Kiss, we could never be together. So what are your wierd crushes, you freaks? For inspiration, check out  urlLink Normal Guys who Make Women Wild  for some Jerry Orbach, John Malkovich and Philip Seymour Hoffman lovin' (among others).  P.S. I was looking at the Hal montage, and I can't help but think he bears more than a passing resemblance to 'Crazy' Pat Koenig in some of the shots.

We actually got to attend a pre-screening of the show courtesy of United Way, so I felt important.  Anyway, I must say that all of the hype was well worth it.  I did enjoy the original cartoon flick, but this blew me away.  The story line is the same, but they have added a couple new songs for the production.  In my opinion (and the Tonys agree as well), the costumes are what make this production so spectacular.  They create a giraffe from a person balancing all fours on stilts and them wearing a long giraffe neck and head.  These creatures come on stage teetering and anbling around, much like a real giraffe.  The opening number (the good old 'Circle of Life') brings all the animals of the sahara out to celebrate Simba's brith, including an elephant, a cheetah, gazelles, soaring birds, and zebra.  Just fantastic.    I must also comment on the music, since it is a musical.  It is rich with African influence and Rafiki, the crazy monkey, takes on the role of almost an ancient African healer.  Not that he wasn't in the movie, but it is exaggerated in the live show.  But the new songs, the scenery, the costumes all keep it real with the African theme.  Loved it!  Just in case I've piqued your interest, the show will remain in Indy until the end of March and then goes to Columbus, San Fran, Boston, and Detroit (not in that order), and is always playing up in NYC."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I've been thinking about what a strange thing it is that we have language at all... that we have these sets of grammar and vocabulary and intonation patterns that allow us to communicate.  I was sitting here reading  urlLink something about Semiotics  (semiotics is the study of how signs relate to their meaning), and I thought, 'Language is such a funny thing.  Where did it come from?  How did we make it?' and then I realised that that's like asking where sight came from, or where walking came from.  How did we figure those things out?  How did we invent them?  We didn't.  If a human is healthy, barring abnormal circumstances, when they are able to walk, they will walk.  When they are able to see, they will see.  When they are able to speak, they will speak.  Language is still incomprehensible to me though.  How is it possible that I can say 'ridiculous' and people know what I mean?  Once, way back when, someone explained to me what that word meant, or used it in the context of other words enough that I realised what it meant, but how did I know what  those  words meant?  And so on and so on until I am so young that I have no vocabulary, am without language, without the ability to walk, and I see all these people around me with those skills and I just try it out one day and then it grows and grows until one day I find myself writing a blog using all of these words that were defined by people using other words.  And how do I know that my words make other people think of what I think when I say them?  I know, I know, people say crap like that all the time, like the annoying blonde in Waking Life, who goes on this rant:   'Creation seems to come out of imperfection. It seems to come out of a striving and a frustration, and this is where I think language came from. It came from our desire to transcend our isolation and have some sort of connection with one another. And it had to be easy when it was just simple survival. Like the word 'water,' we came up with a sound for that, or 'sabre tooth tiger right behind you,' we came up with a sound for that. But when it gets really interesting is when we use that same system of symbols to communicate all the abstract and intangible things that we're experiencing. What is frustration? Or what is anger? Or love? When I say love, the sound comes out of my mouth and it hits the other person's ear, travels through this byzantine conduit in their brain, through their memories of love, or lack of love, and they register what I'm saying and they say yes, they understand. But how do I know they understand, because words are inert, they're just symbols, they're dead, you know?'   I want to slap her every time I watch that scene, but that could be the dumb voice and the up-talk.  I feel like she's on to something but somehow there's something missing there.  Language is natural to humans.  It takes very  urlLink bizarre circumstances  to prevent them from acquiring it.  It's one of those things that are inherently obvious to humans, like walking or breathing or laughing or unconscious flirting.  It's not like math.  Math is something that we are constantly adding to, it takes study, it doesn't show up in every culture.  It took us thousands of years to even think of having a zero in the system.  I feel like people like the Waking Life chick are looking at language like an invented system, like math.  Math is incredible and I feel like it is a complete system already, we just haven't discovered all of it, but I don't think it's like language.  The difference that I've been thinking about is not that language is more fluid than math, less concerned with absolutes, but that we acquire the two skills so differently.        posted by Heather Ann |  urlLink 1:54 PM  urlLink  postCount('108395396844463924');    |  urlLink  postCountTB('108395396844463924');\n\nText 2:I found this in a random blog today:  'There are moments between people when something happens. Something non-physical, non-verbal, inexplicable--mystical. It often doesn't make sense within the normal parameters of what usually contributes to the development of such a relational connection, key factors being time and shared experience.  I'm not writing about love at first sight, or even romance for that matter. It certainly can be romantic, but the connection I'm referring to can also be purely platonic. I usually find this connectivity in making eye contact with others, but it doesn't happen with everyone. There is something I cannot deny in the eyes of some strangers, in some of my acquaintances that draws me to them, that evokes greater compassion, desire to relate. It is an unspoken kinship that often never becomes fully actualized. Somehow the experiences of these people, their thoughts, dreams, and fears, resonate deeply within me like monsoon thunder in July.  I know this, whatever it is, when I see it. I am always thankful to find it. And when I do, I find my mind more at peace, my heart more fully beating.'  Oh, how I love when people put into words things that I have only thought that I imagined.   So I am fairly sure that me and the boy will just remain friends.

It appears that the one Lay hired is%A0James E. Sharp%A0of 'Sharp and Associates' in Washington, D.C. A March 6, 2004 article%A0by K%E9llia Ramares in Online Journal noted that the 'James Sharp' in Washington,  D.C.%A0had previously worked for Lay.  Dubya also hired%A0the same James Sharp as his personal attorney after the investigation into who%A0'outed' Valerie Plame as a CIA operative heated up. As John Dean of Watergate fame noted, it was necessary for Bush to hire an outside attorney to ensure that their%A0conversations%A0were protected by attorney-client  privilege. If Bush had talked to White House counsel Alberto Gonzales instead, the prosecutor might have been able to subpoena Gonzales and compel him to testify about his conversations with Bush.   And to think I dismissed the conspiracy ramblings of Michael Moore. The network of Republicans does seem to curve inward a lot.  The Grid lit up over delaying the election in case of terrorist attack. Remember in 2000 when the right-wing media was talking about Bill Clinton using the Y2K bug to  urlLink declare Marshal Law  and continue on as president? Amazing how most people who hear this real news about his administration actively seeking a plan is met with a yawn. This does not mean Bush is getting a free ride on this issue, but simply that Americans now get the scare game and ignore it en masee. That is ultimately bad for Bush.   urlLink Josh Marshall finally covers the Niger issue I talked about a few days ago.   This gay marriage thing is so convoluted I have no real comment. Mass. is not sinking in to hell because of same sex marriage, and America will notice. To Republicans: Like the civil rights movement of the 60's... you lost, humanity wins. But the South will still feel justified in their ignorance & love you... and stay poor because no one will invest & grow businesses in backward conservative towns.  urlLink Sorry for the facts . Even most urlLink  businesses understand this fact . It doesn't matter, really, since the Republicans can't even bring to a vote the constitutional amendment, which would fail anyway, because they urlLink  can't agree on which version to put forth .

ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Carrie Russell.  It looks at the TEACH Act.  From the ERIC Digest:  With the recent passage of a new law eagerly-awaited by educators, the same type of copyright protected materials that a teacher would ordinarily use in the physical classroom can now--in general--be used in the digital classroom. The 'Technology, Education and Copyright Harmonization (TEACH) Act,' which President Bush signed into law on November 2, 2002, amends two sections of the U.S. copyright law that educators rely on when using copyrighted materials in the classroom without prior permission from the copyright holder (Section 110 on exemption for performance and displays and 112 on exemption for ephemeral recordings). TEACH expands existing exemptions to allow for the digital transmission of copyrighted materials, including on Web sites, so they may be 'viewed' by enrolled students. However, in order to take advantage of the exemptions, educational institutions must meet specific obligations outlined in the law. This ERIC Digest outlines both the privileges and the requirements of TEACH.\n\nText 2:How low can a Landlord get?   urlLink Landlord Wants $27K From 9/11 Victim"], "gold_label": 0.0}

The sun is out, there isn't a cloud in the sky (although you can see the smog on the horizon, if you  want  something to be picky about), and it's warm.  Not April-warm, you know, but February-warm.  It's currently 41\u00b0 where I work (according to weather.com), which is downright agreeable when you consider that I had to defrost my car before I could go anywhere this morning.  Unfortunately, for the next 3.5 hours I'm only going to be able to enjoy this beautiful day through the large window in my office.  Of course, I can't really complain too much.  If I wasn't at work, I'd likely be enjoying this beautiful day through the windows of my apartment, as I sat on the couch playing NCAA Football on PlayStation2.  I did get to enjoy the day for a few minutes on my lunch break, at least.  I still had a few minutes left when I got back from Wendy's, so I rolled down the windows on my car to feel the breeze while I listened to some music.  The CD in my car stereo right now is the greatest hits of Huey Lewis and the News, which I think is perfect for days like this.  It's feel-good music.  I only had a few minutes, but it was nice to have those few minutes to myself, to sit and revel in the music and the day.  I just wish the rest of my lunch hour was like that.  Today I ate at Wendy's, which generally makes for a good lunch break no matter what else happens.  The food and service was good today, so I have no complaints about that.  What got on my nerves is that today was apparently 'Bring Your Three-Year-Old to Wendy's' Day, and no, I didn't get that memo.  If I had, I would have visited another Wendy's (lucky me, there are two of them nearby).  Children drive me crazy.  The high-pitched voice of a toddler is piercing:  it cuts through the din of a crowded restaurant and assails my ears like fingernails on a chalkboard.  That's just when they talk, which they rarely do.  Normally they scream and yell, which makes me want to puncture my own eardrums to lessen the suffering.  Never, even if I sat in front of my computer screen for a million years, could I describe my feelings about children any better than ESPN's  urlLink Sports Guy , Bill Simmons.  Take it away, Bill:   Here's the deal with kids: When you get married, your other friends who have kids tell you, 'It's great, you have to do it, it's the best experience you'll ever have.'  And then they spend the next 15 minutes telling you how they don't sleep, they get up three times a night, their kids keep getting them sick, they haven't left the house in three months, they stink like diapers, they can't find a good babysitter, they never have sex, and they don't have time to watch TV, follow sports, play sports, go to the movies or basically do anything at all. Really, it sounds fantastic.  I have a theory on this: I think 90 percent of parents can't believe how miserable they are, so they make a secret pact and try to get everyone else to have kids, just so everyone else is in the same boat and they don't have to hear stories about four-course dinners, Vegas trips, romantic getaway weekends and everything else. They're like Jim Jones in Guyana -- 'Drink the Kool-Aid, seriously, it's phenomenal! You have to try this!'   Bill Simmons, ladies and gentlemen.  While there are exceptions, it is my solemn contention that children aren't really people until they're maybe twelve or so.  Until that point, any line-crossing should cause them to be dispatched with extreme prejudice.  Okay, I'm kidding about that, but come on, what's wrong with some discipline?  It just seems like so many parents take their kids in public and then become totally oblivious to them, while the kids are running around, screaming, banging into things and people, and generally being as horrible and annoying as is humanly possible.  Now I'll let you in on a little secret, which compounds my problem:  babies stare at me.  By babies, I mean anyone under, say, five years old.  Most guys want to be babe magnets; I appear to be a  baby  magnet.  For some inexplicable reason, they're attracted to me.  Not in any sort of reverse-pedophilic sort of way, but in the sort of way that insects are attracted to light fixtures.  Or like cats always seem to flock to the person who is allergic to them.  They just know I don't like them, and delight in making me as uncomfortable as they can.  As a sidenote, animals also tend to really like me.  I don't mind that, though, as I actually  like  animals.  And okay, I really don't mind it when babies stare at me.  I think it's funny.  Everything else I talked about is truly annoying, though.\n\nText 2:Ah, finally...someone else I know is coming here from Canada for a visit. First was my cousin, Lars in May of 2003.

I suck.   Got the dryer delivered and it turns out the dumbfuck landlord has a 50 amp range outlet in the basement instead of a 30 amp dryer outlet.  That's why the old dryer burned up.  The delivery guys wouldn't hook up the new dryer with the incorrect outlet, so my Mom called the landlord.  He said he's not going to pay to have the outlet replaced; we have to.  Needless to say I'm not happy about that, but at least we'll have a dryer.  The electrician is coming tomorrow to replace the outlet.

What food do you like that most people hate?   Boy there's probably a veritable assload of foods that I like that most people can't stand, but I'm coming up short here.  I guess I'm going to go with the old Chef Boyardee Ravioli in a can.  For some reason, I find this delicious, yet everyone I know thinks it smells bad and is horrible tasting.  I don't get it.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Do you have a half hour?  Here goes:  a. White n' creamy  - I won't eat anything a white and creamy consistency, which includes: sour cream, mayonaisse, cottage cheese, ranch dressing, cream cheese etc.  I don't know why that is, but none of the above foods or condiments sounds good to me.  At all.  b. Fungus  - I will not eat anything resembling a mushroom.  People spend all kinds of money trying to keep athlete's foot at bay, yet people are willing to eat 'shrooms.  Yuck.  I think the thing that creeps me out about fungus is that it's a scary cross between the animal and plant world.  c. Seafood  - Anything out of the water is staying off of my plate.  That includes: tuna (can or otherwise), fish sticks, croppies, crappies, halibut, salmon, shrimp, whatever.  Sorry, but everything in the aquatic world has a real 'dirty water' taste to me.  And shrimp?  Since when does eating maggots or worms from the water sound appetizing?  d. Nuts  - Some people like to gobble up nuts.  Not me.  The only kind I like are peanuts.  Period.  Cashews, walnuts, almonds...ick.  Bad aftertaste.  That enough for now.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Jennifer Garner.  The list is endless, but this horse-face is sticking out like a sore thumb.  I swear, she looks like Melissa Rivers who is easily one of the most disgusting 'personalities' working in the biz today.  What is Jennifer Garner's appeal?  She's very plain, her eyes are too close together, and I think she's one of the shittiest actresses around (besides that black hole of talent Julia Roberts).  Yet...everyone seems to like ol' Jen Garner.  Shit.    4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   Sheryl Crow.  I don't know if it's her looks or the complete package, but ol' Sherrie does something for me.  Yeah, she's a little bit older and could definitely benefit from a sandwich or two, but I don't know, I dig her vibe.  Her version of Led Zepplin's D'yer Ma'ker is one song of hers that tickles the cockles...of my heart.   5. What popular trend baffles you?   Those stupid ass walkie talkies cell phones.  Isn't the cell phone enough for you?  No, when you've got to talk to someone immediately, just push a button and open your fat mouth.    'Yeah, Jim are you there?  Over.'   'Yeah, Scott.  Go ahead for Jim.'   'Uh, Jim I can't seem to find the plunger and...'   'Oh yeah, Scott.  It's behind the...'   Annoying.  Infinitely annoying.  As if it wasn't bad enough that we have to hear one half of someone's conversation when they're talking on their cell phone, now we have to hear two assholes acting like their driving freight down the highway.  Some dick in my firefighting class had one and was talking to some shitheel IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS!  Nice guy, but I wanted him dead and his walkie-talkie smashed to pieces. ---------- Bass Babe - About the low pants: yeah, definitely trying to hard.  These pigs usually have a tattoo above their crack in close proximity.  'You like my ass?  No?  How about the tattoo instead?'  Sorry ladies.  No.  PB - What happened with Lee Jeans?  Is he out of the picture?\n\nText 2:End of Year Reflection  by Bass Babe  As 2003 comes to a close (and I have nothing to do at work), I'm reflecting on all the big things 2003 has brought me, in order:  1.

Determination to make changes in my life.  I can honestly say that 2003 is not on my list of 'happy & fulfilled' years. I discovered a part of me that I am not proud of in any way. I wanted to be with someone so badly that I lost respect for myself. And this, I deeply regret. But I suppose it is gratifying to know that I can come out of a situation like that and dig myself out of the hole. The experience of it all has definitely left me a changed woman. And change is, in this case, good.   These last few months I've been very focused on changing my path in life and I'm excited for the future. More as it happens, 'landahz...  Happy New Year!

Funny Story:  I haven't blogged in a while because the internet at our house has been down because of Lady Misfortune choosing to strike at the heart of my housemate's computer, the self-same one that conducts the internet to the rest of our comps.  Although we are currently investigating a number of different things, Mike's computer remains silent.  The funny part of this story concerns moving my computer into the upstairs bathroom cubby and pleading, conjoling and cursing it into operational status.  Although it does everything else, it still does not accept the Internet.  I will teach it about respect yet.  So here we find me, sitting at work again (I really do have a job that occasionally requires effort, honest injun), fighting the Man, and using the internet illegally.  I've been having a week that as far as I can tell, has been nothing but good.  I've got to see a lot of people.  Some of those people were the Barenaked Ladies (woo-hoo).  Work has been really good.  Our boss came back from her sick leave, so certain....plans and schemes can be set into motion.  Someone from 6100 likes me.  Or so I hear.....  We sat down at home and fleshed out plans, and cleared up uncertainty, and came to realize our own Bungalow mortality.    I worked out with my mom.  I wheeled-dealed with my dad.  Huh.  I continue my campaign to cast off fear and uncertainty, to pursue truth, to enjoy life, and figure out my place in the Plan.  One thing I can say for sure, Neal Hausch rocks.

I have neighbors on one side of my apartment. I'm on a corner unit. And they seem like nice folks except for the loud music at very early hours. They also have a friend that lives in the building who comes by their apt. to visit quite often and rings the doorbell whenever she stops by. It's kinda like a dorm for them...ahh dorm life *nostalgia surge* the days when you could stumble 'home' after a drunken adventure by simply following the hallway walls.   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.  Most favorite: I have to agree with Panda. I love the smell in the air -- lilacs especially. And it's the season before my favorite, Summer. What can I say? I like it hot.  Least favorite: my work building turns on the air conditioning in spring, so it's not only sometimes cold outside, it's freezing inside all the time. I hate it. My fingers are losing mobility as I type...this...now.   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partneryou can fantasize here).   I'm a sucker for musicians, big time. The creativity, passion, focus, and drive are all highly attractive qualities for me. Actually it doesn't necessarily have to be music.

ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Rozana Carducci.  From the ERIC Digest:  A study by Huber states that 'community college faculty constitute 31% of all U.S. higher education faculty, teaching 39% of all higher education students and 46% of all first-year students' (as cited in Editors notes, 2002, p. 1). Given the strong presence of community college faculty in the academy, it is essential that colleges develop institutional programs and policies that enhance community college teaching and learning. To be effective, these programs need to take into account the differing backgrounds, perspectives, and goals of community college faculty.   This Digest, drawn from 'Community College Faculty: Characteristics, Practices, and Challenges'(New Directions for Community Colleges, Summer 2002), summarizes research findings on the similarities and differences among community college faculty groups and concludes with a discussion of how this information can be used to increase the relevance and effectiveness of faculty development initiatives. The research findings of this NDCC are drawn from the Center for the Study of Community Colleges' 2000 National Faculty Survey and the 1993 and 1999 National Survey of Post-secondary Faculty.\n\nText 2:Man wears name tag: To make the world a friendlier place  ST.

The brief review which I wrote for  urlLink the Amazon site  is reproduced below. For anyone who is interested in the historical precedents and parallels in Bush and Blair's 'crusade', it's essential reading.   'The political influence, democratic soundness and wisdom of waging war in Iraq by George Bush and Tony Blair has provoked a seemingly endless stream of comment, debate, and books. But 'Picking The Bones' takes a different approach to the likes of 'Dude, Where's My Country' and 'Weapons of Mass Deception' by examining the way in which political rhetoric has exploited a revisionist and highly selective kind of history in order to justify war.  America is, we are told, 'land of the free', 'where all man are created equal'. Yet America's history is awash with bloodshed, tainted by racism, and shamed by slavery. When Americans talk about freedom, what do they mean? Native and African Americans, the people of Hiroshima, Vietnam, the Philippines and Grenada (not to mention Iraq) have all been on the receiving end of America's military might and suffered from the savagery of war. Some, it seems, are more equal than others. Regan points to British atrocities too, skewers the myth that the French are 'cheese eating surrender monkeys' and demonstrates with remarkable clarity the historical precedents for America's 'War on Terror'.   If the book has a failing it is that it provides what feels like a surfeit of information; as the book progresses Regan demonstrates countless war crimes, lies, and double standards to the point where the reader reels from the facts. But when the author, at the book's close, nails American history as American myth-making, he makes his point astutely, having already given more than enough examples to back himself up.   This rhetorical power aside, he writes wittily and accessibly, with much evident enjoyment, articulating the threat which America, as much as any of Bush and Cheney's 'Axis of Evil', poses to world stability. His book is the historian's counterpart to Graham Greene's description of The Quiet American, who is 'as incapable of imagining pain or danger to himself as he [is] incapable of conceiving the pain he might cause others'."], "gold_label": 0.0}

I would like to apologize to MAC officials for saying they were responsible for last night's horrible officiating performance.  I stand by my statement that they're generally not very good, though, and that they're KNOWN for being not very good.  Consider this:  last night's contest featured two MAC teams, so why use officials from a different conference?  It just so happens that the game was  televised  on Fox Sports Ohio.  Having the typically bad MAC officiating in front of a partisan crowd of 2,100 or so who are going to think the officials suck anyway isn't that big of a deal, but I'm guessing the conference administration had no desire to showcase it to a potentially large television audience.  Sure, the officiating sucked anyway, but at least now they have plausible deniability:  'well, they weren't  our  officials.'\n\nText 2:Today is April 12, 2004.  One year ago today, Brandi and I went out on our first date.  It was a Saturday.  I went to BGSU's spring football game that afternoon, then came home and watched a Reds game on television (and perhaps napped a bit on the couch) before showering and getting dressed and ready.  If I remember correctly, I showed up at Brandi's apartment at 6:00.  We hung out and chatted there for a little while, and then went out.  We went to dinner at The Spaghetti Warehouse in Toledo.  Afterwards we went to Showcase Cinemas in Maumee to see Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson in  Anger Management .  Then we went to a bar called Brewster's in BG, which was far too loud and crowded for our tastes at the time, and from there we went to BW3.  We had a drink or two there, and then went back to my apartment to watch movies and hang out a little bit longer.  The movies we watched were  As Good as it Gets  and  The Wedding Singer  (sticking with Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler), and we continued talking and getting to know each other.  Neither of us wanted the night to end, and thus she ended up staying over.  I took her home the next afternoon shortly before she had to go to work.  Needless to say, it was a magical evening, and one of the first building blocks in where we are today.  Getting here was no easy task.  When we first started dating, Brandi had just recently come out of a relationship and didn't feel ready to jump right into another.  I had been out of my last relationship for a longer period of time, but after being in a relationship nearly constantly for nine years (one for three, another on and off for six), I was planning to enjoy the single life for a while.  Neither of us was looking for what we found.  Some interesting anecdotes from early on....  When Brandi and I first met, I was kind of seeing her friend Cricket.  I went out to BW3 one Wednesday to meet up with Cricket at their karaoke night, and Brandi was there.  After hanging out for a bit, the three of us eventually moved on to a place called Skybar.  Eventually Brandi and I struck up a conversation.  She was still dating her ex-boyfriend at that time, and we were actually talking mostly about that, but it was enough to sow the seeds of a mutual attraction.  The second time we ran into each other is when I got her number and we actually decided to go out sometime.  That was an interesting evening, to say the least.  See, I originally went out to meet up with another girl (Sarah) that I had met recently.  However, the bar where we decided to meet up was a place that I was known to frequent, so Cricket and Brandi went there to look for me.  They found me before Sarah did.  This put me in a weird spot, because I was worried about screwing things up with Cricket.  So I blew Sarah off, stopped looking for her, and luckily didn't run into her.  I felt bad about that, but I saw it as my only option at the time--I don't think Cricket was under any impressions that she was the only girl I was seeing, but I still thought it might be a bit awkward for all of us to run into each other.  At any rate, it turned out not to matter, as both Cricket and Sarah soon became romantically irrelevant.  The first thing Brandi said to me that night was 'My boyfriend broke up with me.'  I picked up on that as a signal right away and let it set the tone for the evening.  Eventually the three of us ended up in a group out on the dance floor, where Brandi and I kept talking.  It came out at some point that we were attracted to each other, and we decided to get together and go out sometime.  I felt a little weird about it, since this was Cricket's friend, but really, I knew already that things were going nowhere with Cricket (in terms of dating, that is...she's very cool, and we're all friends now--she's dating my friend and former roommate Adam, and we hang out relatively often); I even had a sense (which was later confirmed by Brandi) that Cricket knew what was going on and was cool with it.  Anyway, Brandi and I started dancing together, and before the night had ended we were holding hands and she had kissed me on the cheek.  Nothing major, especially considering some of the goings-on at college bars, but plenty for my mind, which was already overloaded with the evening's proceedings (and a fine layer of alcohol).  Brandi and I started dating in April, and I moved into a new apartment in May.  In between, we spent a lot of time at her place.  I ended up staying over pretty frequently.  We'd usually talk the night away and well into the morning.  Sleeping there was interesting at any rate.  Her bedroom was immediately next to a railroad track, and it was pretty common to be awoken by a train rumbling past, blowing its horn.  Also, not too far from her apartment was a charming little pig-slaughtering facility.  Occasionally we'd be lulled to sleep (or jarred from it) by the lovely sound of pigs shrieking their last breaths away.  Still, I wouldn't trade those times for anything.  That was when she and I got to know each other.  We talked openly about the obstacles facing our relationship, and that helped open our lines of communication.  As we talked, we realized that it wasn't going to be easy, but I think that's also when we began to discover that it would be worth it.  Early on, I think it would have been easy for either of us to call it off.  As I've said, there was plenty of stuff in our way, and neither of us went into this looking for a long-term relationship.  However, as we continued to spend time together, we started falling for each other, almost against our wills.  It just happened.  Eventually I came to realize that it would be harder for me to be without her than it would be for us to work through our difficulties.  It seems that she came to that conclusion as well.  So that's where we started from, around this time last year.  Now we've been together for this long, and we're planning to move in together soon.  I think this is a good move for us, and I'm excited about it.  She'll be back in BG in August, at the latest, and I can't wait to have her."], "gold_label": 1.0}

These last couple of weeks have been insane, I feel really bad about being so lazy and ignoring this blog. Let me try and remember the big points, then I can start afresh with no guilt.  *We had three bead classes, and made up a ton of kits, so that took a lot of time. I have really gotten back into beads, with a serious passion. I haven\u2019t been this excited about them for a while.  *We have still been doing tennis, so that\u2019s cool.  *I have worked a couple days at Dad\u2019s, so that was boring as usual.  *I am considering joining up with my old dance group again, that\u2019s completely weird because when I quit I vowed never to join again. But eh, I guess the dance just wants out.  *I have decided to paint my walls tope and buy all those old movies posters I have been dreaming about, they include but are not limited to: Casablanca, Rear Window, Notorious, Singing in the Rain, and most importantly\u2026The Godfather.  *We went to Adventureland as a fam, had an okay time and now we can live until next summer free of guilt from the parental units. They will not be allowed to pull \u201cYou didn\u2019t even go to Adventureland with us this year.\u201d Out and use it as blackmail. We have them now.  *Okay, through quite an unfortunate, insane, barely believable turn of events, Zach and I are no longer friends. I wish I could just pour out the whole thing here, but that\u2019s not fair to him. Baisically what it bolied down to was him completely dumping me as a friend because he didn\u2019t agree with my view on something, I was willing to accept our differences, but he didn\u2019t care enough I guess. So ther we have it, he just slapped me out of his life. This is the first time I have ever been rejected by a firend that I actually cared about, and I guess it was just more shock then anything. Ug, if you don\u2019t know the story then it probably makes no sense. Lets just say I got the smack layed down on me, and for no good reason whatsoever.

In other news, I am taking a class on Tuesday nights. Im not giving out the name of the place because I want to tell you about some of the people in my class. And I would feel horrible if they knew I was discussing their quirks on the Internet. Not that they would somehow stumble onto Pandyland, realize I am talking about them, and figure out who I am. But still -- I have paranoia issues.   Back to my story  Im starting to think that this undisclosed organization plants people in their classes in order to boost the confidence of the other students. Because my class has two that are somewhat questionable.   Its a freelance writing class, so on the first day we did the usual interview-the-person-sitting-next-to-you thing. Youd think that in a room full of potential reporters, youd get some pretty straight facts. Not the case with the guy sitting next to me  while introducing me, he went on about how I am there to pursue an advanced degree, and how I publish a journal about insurance and issues relating to insurance, etc. etc.   Neither of these things came out of my mouth  Im definitely not there to pursue an advanced degree because, well, they dont grade you on the classes and dont actually offer any degrees. I did say that I do employee newsletters for an insurance company, so I guess I do see how he could confuse that with an insurance journal. But the nature of what I write for work involves very little objective research  just a lot of pat Bob on the back because he sold a huuuuuuuuge policy!!!! AOW!!!!!   Still, this guy pales in comparison to the lady who I shall now refer to only as Crazy Lady.   On the first day she apologized for being 45 minutes late and having to leave an hour early  our class is two hours long. This week, our assignment was to get writers guidelines from publications wed like to write for. Its a pretty simple task, all it involves is a few minutes on the internet or a few minutes to fill out the addresses on a couple of envelopes. Not a big deal.   When we got around the room to her, she said she didnt do the assignment  and that, quite frankly, she didnt realize this was going to be so much work. When asked who shed like to write for she said  I didnt really think about it. I dont know. I guess  National Geographic . Its always been my dream to be a photographer for  National Geographic . Which doesnt exactly explain why shes in a freelance  writing  class...but hey, whatever works.  Finally, last night there was a reception for some grant winners going on outside the door of our classroom. We all joked around about mingling during break time  but really, we were joking. Crazy Lady, apparently, was not. She came back from break with a glass of wine.   So anywaysthose are my storiesfor now. Im sure I will tell more later.\n\nText 2:My friend and I did   Wham!'s  Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go  .  We didn't win, though.  CK2 won with her rendition of Garbage's 'Stupid Girl.'

I plan on getting soooooooo drunk I don't even remember my name, let alone all of the people I'm pissed off at right now.  We'll be at Iron Tales Saloon in Canton; drop by and buy us a drink!  The GTI is going back into the doctor tomorrow to have his transmission seal replaced.  I picked my Mom up from work tonight then we ran back home so I could put on pants (I was wearing Adidas shorts) and so she could get her purse.  We then went to AutoZone to buy an air filter for her car.  On the way there my car started whistling/whining in third gear.  Well upon leaving AutoZone and returning home, 3rd gear started groaning and whining.  I'm guessing the transmission is either dry or close to dry.  I parked my car in a different space tonight, and I'll check for the telltale puddle in the morning.  If there's no puddle I'll be sure the tranny is the noise-maker.  My Mom is being nice and loaning me the money for my tranny seal; hopefully I'll be able to get my struts and coils soon as well, but that's a tick more expensive.  Rained all day today.  I didn't do much of anything, and it was nice.  This weekend I'm busy.  Friday night Jenny and I are going out, Saturday night I'm free and Sunday night I'm going to the Clutch concert in Cleveland.  I emailed  urlLink Jamie   to see if he wants to hang out tomorrow (Wednesday).  I hope he's free as I just sit around the house and think when left to my own devices, and that's not a good thing.  That is all.\n\nText 2:Not much going on worth talking about.  I worked today, and was finished by 8PM.  Didn't sleep for shit last night, so I was worn out all day long.

In other news, I am taking a class on Tuesday nights. Im not giving out the name of the place because I want to tell you about some of the people in my class. And I would feel horrible if they knew I was discussing their quirks on the Internet. Not that they would somehow stumble onto Pandyland, realize I am talking about them, and figure out who I am. But still -- I have paranoia issues.   Back to my story  Im starting to think that this undisclosed organization plants people in their classes in order to boost the confidence of the other students. Because my class has two that are somewhat questionable.   Its a freelance writing class, so on the first day we did the usual interview-the-person-sitting-next-to-you thing. Youd think that in a room full of potential reporters, youd get some pretty straight facts. Not the case with the guy sitting next to me  while introducing me, he went on about how I am there to pursue an advanced degree, and how I publish a journal about insurance and issues relating to insurance, etc. etc.   Neither of these things came out of my mouth  Im definitely not there to pursue an advanced degree because, well, they dont grade you on the classes and dont actually offer any degrees. I did say that I do employee newsletters for an insurance company, so I guess I do see how he could confuse that with an insurance journal. But the nature of what I write for work involves very little objective research  just a lot of pat Bob on the back because he sold a huuuuuuuuge policy!!!! AOW!!!!!   Still, this guy pales in comparison to the lady who I shall now refer to only as Crazy Lady.   On the first day she apologized for being 45 minutes late and having to leave an hour early  our class is two hours long. This week, our assignment was to get writers guidelines from publications wed like to write for. Its a pretty simple task, all it involves is a few minutes on the internet or a few minutes to fill out the addresses on a couple of envelopes. Not a big deal.   When we got around the room to her, she said she didnt do the assignment  and that, quite frankly, she didnt realize this was going to be so much work. When asked who shed like to write for she said  I didnt really think about it. I dont know. I guess  National Geographic . Its always been my dream to be a photographer for  National Geographic . Which doesnt exactly explain why shes in a freelance  writing  class...but hey, whatever works.  Finally, last night there was a reception for some grant winners going on outside the door of our classroom. We all joked around about mingling during break time  but really, we were joking. Crazy Lady, apparently, was not. She came back from break with a glass of wine.   So anywaysthose are my storiesfor now. Im sure I will tell more later.\n\nText 2:Shit.  Not sure why that is.  Everything seems to be working okay.  Dammit.  Maybe it'll come back up tomorrow.  Otherwise, I can e-mail it to Panda and see if she's got better luck.  For some reasons, the pictures stay up better when she does it, playa."], "gold_label": 1.0}

Frequent requests for presidential portraits inspired Prints and Photographs Division staff to compile this ready reference aid of formal and informal pictures in the division's custody.
