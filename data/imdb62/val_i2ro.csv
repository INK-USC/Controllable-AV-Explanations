0,"Text1: SPOILERS will follow . . . I remember the early 80's horror series on which this movie is based on . It was a dumb and corny series , to be honest . In fact , the TV-station in my country stopped broadcasting it after only a few episodes due to a lack of interest of the viewers . I've done some research considering its status in the rest of the world and it seems that the series didn't broke through anywhere . Then came the movie in 1990 which was a pleasant surprise . I really hope the status of the TV-series didn't spoil the ( possible ) success of the movie . Tales from the Dark Side : The movie illuminates 3 very interesting horror icons . We've got a mummy , a black cat and a Gargoyle . . . you can never go wrong with those 3 . Heck , throw in a werewolf and we've got ourself a horror party ! ! ! This film follows the old-fashioned way of combining short stories . This means : through a wraparound story . True , this thing is very dumb and childish but try to consider it to be a modern version of the fairy-tale in which a wicked witch eats a boy . I rather hear Blondie singing her classic 80's songs like "" Atomic "" then seeing her act , but that's just me . Then there are the stories . The first one , Lot 249 , is awesome ! ! ! It's got STEVE BUSCEMI and a freakin ' MUMMY ! ! What else could you possibly wish for ? ? . . . Several familiar faces in this story by the way . Christian Slater and Julliane Moore star as well . Buscemi ( the world's best actor ) uses a mummy to take revenge towards some rich and spoiled collage students who try to ruin his career . It's got Buscemi . . . that's all you need to know . That and the fact that it was written by sir Arthur Conan Doyle . . . Cat from Hell , the second story has a pretty good tension going for it . An old dark house with a black murdering cat . That counts as setting the right atmosphere , doesn't it . Cat from hell is a co-operation between the writings of Stephen King and zombie master George Romero . When it comes to pure "" scary and creepy "" , Cat from Hell is the best story . The final story , Lover's Vow , will impress you when you see it . There's no doubt about that . It's a very good and original idea , I'll admit that . But with a bit of logical thinking , you'll find out it's very cheesy . I'm not going to spoil anything of this segment . . . except for the fact that the gargoyle looks really good . One of the best I've seen . . . Recommended . . . ( btw . . . have I already mentioned it stars Steve Buscemi ? ? )

Text2: Za Ginipiggu 2 Chiniku no Hana , or more commonly known to English speaking audiences as Guinea Pig : Flowers of Flesh and Blood , starts with some scrolling text that states in April 1985 a Japanese cartoonist named Hideshi Hibino received a parcel from an ' enthusiastic ' fan containing some 8mm film & a few still photo's that appear to show the brutal execution of a woman , it then states that what follows is a reconstruction ( therefore definitely not real ) of what the film & photo's depict . . . A young Japanese woman has just left a subway station when a car starts to follow her , at this point she becomes scared & runs but doesn't get very far in her red high heeled shoes & the man from the car catches her in a park & knocks her out using a chloroform soaked cloth . When she awakes the woman finds herself tied to a bed in the middle of a small room whose walls appear to be covered in blood stains & splatters , at this point she is probably seriously frightened . The man who abducted her now has a rubber apron on & a Samurai helmet , he picks a chicken up from a nearby cage & says ' look ! This is your fate ' he then slices the chickens head off with a curved blade , at this point she is probably bricking herself & with good reason as he then proceeds to dope her up with drugs & take great pleasure in dismembering her body piece by piece . . . This Japanese production was written & directed by Hideshi Hino & was the second film in the ' Guinea Pig ' series . First of all I have to say that Za Ginipiggu 2 : Chiniku no Hana is as fake as they come , not one part of this film is real including the decapitation of the chicken & it clearly states in the opening text that it is a reconstruction , a reconstruction of true events I don't know but definitely a reconstruction . Basically this is a splatter film that strips away any character's , events or story & just lays on the blood , violence , gore & rubber limbs for it's 40 odd minute duration . A woman is kidnapped & then brutally hacked to pieces by some nut-case dressed in a rubber apron & Samurai helmet , that's the entire film period . So let's take a look at what matters , the gore & sick stuff . Well I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the special make-up effects as they convince & are really quite difficult to watch at times . From cutting off hands to slicing off legs & from pulling a load of intestines out of a cut opened stomach to a decapitation with an axe & let's not forget scooping an eyeball out of it's socket with a spoon & a macabre sick maggot ridden art gallery where he shows off his handy work . There is plenty of blood , maggots & disgusting stuff to keep even the most jaded gore-hound happy . The only real scary bit is when the woman is still alive ( & in one piece ) & the Samurai walks over to a table full of knives , tools , hammers , chisels , scissors & blades as you feel a certain amount of tension & anticipation at what lies ahead for the next half an hour . The human body part art gallery at the end also has a certain gross atmosphere to it , if you can make it that far . Za Ginipiggu 2 : Chiniku no Hana was obviously shot on a low budget on video , technically it has the production values of a cheap TV soap opera but those very impressive special effects belie their poverty row origins . The music & the over-the-top sound effects become annoying very quickly . Za Ginipiggu 2 : Chiniku no Hana is a strange film as I'm not really sure as to who it was made for , the entire film really is just a Japanese woman being graphically dismembered . For what it's worth I actually quite enjoyed watching it although I'm not too sure what that says about me . If Za Ginipiggu 2 : Chiniku no Hana sounds like the kind of film you may enjoy then you probably will , if it doesn't than I can guarantee you that you won't . A must for those who enjoy extreme cinema & gore .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
1,"Text1: What a fun movie ! If you're a Giallo fan , Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner . To begin with , it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo . Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent Bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life . The kill scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy . One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start . The killer , The Red Queen , is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers I've seen in an Italian movie . The 70s sets and fashions are wonderful . In fact , all the visuals are interesting with the laughing Red Queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film . The convoluted plot held my interest throughout . Finally , Bruno Nicolai's score may be the best I've heard from the composer . The main theme is so memorable I haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days . The only two issues I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times come in the film's finale . First , the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot . If you've seen more than a couple Gialli , you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings . Second , the ending feels a little too rushed and , as a result , is a bit confusing . I'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me , but I'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all . A second viewing might just clear this up .

Text2: Cinema Paradiso works very well because Giuseppe Tornatore , for all his schmaltzy moments with his characters , loves cinema incredibly and especially the communal and personal act of going out to see a movie . It also works because for all the sentiment , he makes it a story essentially about a boy , Toto , without a father after the war who finds a surrogate-cum-mentor with Alfredo , the projectionist at the theater . Their bond makes for the emotional core of the film , as the grown-up Toto comes back to the town he left so long ago for Alfredo's funeral , and looks back on his childhood and adolescence in this small down of Giacardola . The clips of the films are one of the strong-points , and just the scenes inside of the Paradiso , where there's lots of warm human comedy coming out of the fun poked at the ' old-days ' of repression ( i . e . ringing the bell for a kissing scene ) , or just the reactions to the different genres and styles ( everything from Visconti to Chaplin to Bardot is screened ) . And there's a whole host of characters Tornatore has that makes a lot of the first half of the picture pretty special . It's maybe in the second half that it got a little too ' adorable ' for its own good , or just too much of a similar one-track kind of narrative with the teen Toto falling in love with a girl whom makes it his first real roller-coaster of a relationship . But , as mentioned , Tornatore keeps it simple , particularly with respect to Toto and Alfredo ( the latter actor , Phillipe Noiret , is incredible in the part , even when blind for half the running time ) . It's also a given that maestro Ennio Morricone delivers up the goods and makes this really rousing , the sentiment not false for a lot of the time as one of his best scores . If I didn't find it overall a masterpiece for some of its sappy bits and occasional over-the-top performance that doesn't click ( most of them do , it's Italy after all ) , it's an exceptional effort for what it tries to accomplish and what many films end up being simply sappy can't quite reach . The film earns its keep by making it very relatable , and reminds us why some of us love movies and movie-going very much . It's the ' shmoopy ' of Italian cinema lovers everywhere , and its worth the view even in the truncated Harvey Weinstein cut that played at the Rialto theater near my town ; a fond goodbye at a fondly remembered theater .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
2,"Text1: The original Ladykillers is one of those rare comedy classics that's not really funny anymore , like The Odd Couple . But it is smartly made and it respects itself and its audience . It's a dark comedy but it's a smart one , it has colorful characters who move through the movie in pursuit of questionable goals and suffer through lots of hilarious mishaps along the way . Sure , they're not funny , but you have to appreciate the situational humor involved . Like the original film , the 2004 remake focuses on a strange ensemble of characters each in it for the money , no one knows anyone else outside the group , and the leader thinks he has everything planned out to the most minute detail until everything that can possibly go wrong goes wrong at every turn . I remember when The Ladykillers came out in theaters , where I never had the chance to see it , and I remember being genuinely surprised to see that the Dawn of the Dead remake was getting better reviews than this , the latest Tom Hanks movie . I just don't associate Tom Hanks with movies that get lesser acclaim than remakes of 80s horror films . Then I saw the Dawn of the Dead remake and I understood why it was getting better reviews . Now I've seen The Ladykillers and I understand even more . Tom Hanks , as is to be expected , delivers a spot-on performance as an intellectual from the deep south , brilliantly pulling off not only the accent but the demeanor and earthily classy mannerisms as well . Not that I'm some expert on the deep south , but consider his introduction into the film , when he knocks on Mrs . Munson's door and reluctantly pursues her escaped cat ( ' Won't the cat eventually pine for its masters affections and return of its own initiative ? ' ) . I love stuff like that . You don't just come up with dialogue like that , it takes a lot of talent to enhance the complexity of a simple sentence like that . The film has started off on the right foot . And then , of course , you have Marlon Wayans , the most catastrophic casting decision in the entire film by far . I'm confused by his impressive performance in Requiem For A Dream , because in every other movie I've ever seen him involved with he has been an absolute disaster . His ridiculous character screaming mind-numbing streams of profanity single handedly ruined this movie , the Scary Movies , which he wrote , are some of the worst , most sickening slop I've ever seen recorded on film , and Senseless and White Chicks are two movies that I am determined never to see . I'll watch a movie even if I know it's going to be a disaster ( I've seen all three Scary Movies , for example ) , but this time I'm putting my foot down . I can't even IMAGINE sitting through White Chicks , and no amount of curiosity about the formation of Marlon Wayans ' idiot iconography will persuade me to watch Senseless . I'm struggling not to swear off on sight anything that he is ever involved with again . Look at Jamie Foxx , for example , another actor whose career sprung from the dregs of television , In Loving Color . He's certainly been in his share of tasteless roles , but has built up his career to the point where he is generating Oscar buzz for his massive performance in the upcoming Ray , not to mention other great films like Ali , Collateral and , to a slightly lesser extent , Redemption . Wayans is still running around acting like a complete moron in ridiculous roles like this one , single-handedly destroying what should have been a classy and clever remake of a classic . Then again , maybe it's unfair to compare Jamie Foxx and Marlon Wayans , since Wayans could never hope to possess the tiniest fraction of the talent that Foxx has , but you have to have your limits . Never in my life have I seen a Tom Hanks movie that made it so easy to picture him trying to hide his face at the premiere . What kind of a turn is this for the Coen brothers , who generally have characters so rich and interesting that they overshadow most of the rest of the film ? Their movies are not about their stories , they're about the characters . In this film , every single character is a cliché . The stolid general , the idiot jock literally without a thought in his head , the ludicrous MacSam ( Wayans ) who is nothing but a spewing fountain of profanity and a direct insult to the African American audience , one character is even defined by his having irritable bowel syndrome . I really expect more from the Coens , who we have to thank for such masterpieces as Raising Arizona , Fargo , The Big Lebowski and O , Brother , Where Art Thou ? ( spoilers ) Wayans ' brain-dead performance is thankfully outweighed slightly by the strength of Mrs . Munson's character , but unfortunately her character is also a turn from the point of the original film , from which most of the humor was derived . That movie wasn't even very funny , so I would think that every effort possible would be made to maintain the comedy , much of which came from the situation of a lot of men trying to pull a fast one on a sweet little old lady , but who catches on to their game and ends up in control of everything . In this version , you have a lot of men trying to sneak around Mrs . Munson as though she were their mother . She is smarter and stronger than all of them , which removes the irony of their defeat and a large foundation of the comedy in the story . Then the Coens tried to make up for that loss by writing a character like MacSam and succeed only in digging the hole deeper . The Coen brothers have teamed their powerful directing and writing skills with the astronomical talents of Tom Hanks , and thanks in large part to a typical Wayans performance , they have indeed laid a multi-million dollar egg . Miss it .

Text2: Mystery , Alaska is kind of like The Mighty Ducks , except that it's intended for an older , more intelligent audience . The characterization as well as the narrative structure is much more mature , and the players , thankfully , are not little kids but people with a wide range of ages that have played hockey their entire lives as a result of having always lived in such brutally cold weather . There seems to be an underlying theme about the damaging effects of sudden fame , or even the possibility of sudden and even temporary fame , as the town of Mystery goes to great lengths to build onto their town ( particularly the pond ) , so that they will be ready when the New York Rangers arrive . The biggest strength that the Mystery team had was playing on a pond as opposed to in a rink , and building this rink in their town cancelled out that advantage , making their chances of winning against the professional Rangers much smaller . ( spoilers ) Like in Rocky , the point here is not to win the game , because they lost to the Rangers , but the Mystery team went that distance and played a good game against a professional team . They played against all odds and they held their own , and literally came within inches of winning the game against a team that had tremendous advantages against them . After that last shot bounced off of the goal , barely missing , the audience is left trying to figure out a way that the game will have to continue long enough for the home team to win , but when Burt Reynolds ( in an excellent performance as the town judge as well as the father f one of the payers ) starts clapping , it is clear that the game is over and that they have lost . However , the applause that follows , especially that that came from the Rangers , bouncing their sticks on the ice as a show of respect , indicates that they succeeded despite having lost the game . Mystery , Alaska is an excellent film that gives the sports genre a much needed boost , showing an untraditional but refreshing and very effective conclusion that seems bittersweet but leaves you cheering . Russell Crowe further proves his amazing versatility as an actor , and all others involved also performed beautifully . The location is perfectly presented , almost making the audience feel cold just because the setting is so realistic , and the team really does look like a team of small town guys who have known each other and played hockey together all of their lives . You might be able to say that Mystery , Alaska pans out a little too similar to the way that Rocky did , but this is still a great film that just makes you feel good .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

4,"Text1: Opposing forces are at work in a dual plot that makes "" Docks of New Orleans "" an interesting Charlie Chan mystery . An international gang attempts to steal a secret gas formula that they can no longer prevent from being shipped to rival forces in South America . At the same time , the inventor of the gas formula seeks revenge on the owner and partners of the LaFontanne Chemical Company who paid him a measly sum for the formula , while cutting him out of huge profits and a partnership for himself . As usual , Charlie Chan casts a wary eye in all directions and pursues his investigation with excruciating patience . Roland Winters portrays Chan for the second time in this Monogram release . As before in "" The Chinese Ring "" , Victor Sen Yung appears with a confused identity - early in the film , Pop Chan refers to him as Number # 2 son , and somewhat later calls him by the name of Jimmy . Near the end of the movie , Chan calls out to Tommy . For those not as familiar with the Chan characters , Tommy as Number # 3 Son was portrayed in earlier Monogram's by Benson Fong . Was this a confusing lapse in continuity , or was Monogram by this time goofing on it's audience ? Mantan Moreland is back again as Chan servant Birmingham Brown . In an interesting twist , son Jimmy / Tommy retrieves a hijacked vehicle from a parking garage with Moreland's character along for the ride as a passenger ; Birmingham is the Chan chauffeur in earlier films . Birmingham also reprises a humorous exchange with an uncredited Haywood Jones as "" Mobile "" Jones , reminiscent of his "" Pidgin ' English "" dialog with Ben Carter in "" The Scarlet Clue "" and "" Dark Alibi "" . The key to solving the mystery is provided by Tommy and Birmingham in concert ( no pun intended ) when they offer a rendition of "" Chop Suey Boogie "" with Birmingham on piano and Tommy on violin . The high pitched screech of Tommy's violin causes a radio tube to break , leading Charlie to theorize that the deadly gas formula is released in the same manner . To eliminate the three partners who bilked him out of a fortune , inventor Swenstrom cleverly uses his wife's radio broadcasts to break tubes planted in the victims ' home and office radios , set to the precise station at the appropriate times . Granted , "" Docks of New Orleans "" is not high drama , and there are slow moments . Captain McNalley ( John Gallaudet ) of the New Orleans Police Department is particularly inept in dismissing clues and evidence that Chan immediately considers important . All considered though , this is an entertaining mystery and a nifty entry in the Chan series .

Text2: Set in 1866 in Southern Indiana , "" Rage at Dawn "" is based on the true story of the Reno Brothers , purportedly America's first band of train robbers . In the opening sequence , the citizens of North Vernon lie in silent wait for the Brothers , tipped off to a bank job they intend to foil . Though one brother is killed and left behind , the Reno's return to exact revenge on the Peterson Detective Agency contact who placed them at the bank with unique precision . Enter Randolph Scott as Peterson Agent James Barlow ; his mission , along with fellow agent Monk Claxton ( Kenneth Tobey ) , is to infiltrate the Reno Gang , gain their confidence , and put an end to the operation . Faking a thirty thousand dollar train holdup , Barlow attracts the Reno's attention , and gradually gets around to whetting their appetite for a hundred thousand dollar payday . The film boasts a top notch cast of TV and big screen Western veterans , including Forrest Tucker , J . Carroll Naish , and Myron Healey as the Reno Brothers , Denver Pyle as the honest Reno , and Mala Powers as sister Laura providing a romantic interest for Scott's character . Fans will also recognize Ray Teal as a dishonest sheriff in league with the Reno's , and Edgar Buchanan as what else , but a greedily smarmy judge who coordinates Barlow's entry in the Reno circle . The story itself proceeds rather smoothly for the Peterson agents ; for his part , Barlow's plan moves along virtually without a hitch . There are no cliffhanger scrapes for him to get out of , unless you count the relationship with Laura he uses to get close to her brothers . The shootout with the Reno's does leave his partner Claxton dead , chalked up to one of those hazards of the trade . Scott's character gets a chance to exhibit some heroism in the face of a lynch mob , but fails to stop the town of Seymour's citizens from hanging the Reno's . I would stop short of hailing this film as a great Western as some other posters have noted . It's a passable film , though not as good as some of Randolph Scott's other Westerns , including "" The Bounty Hunter "" , "" Ten Wanted Men "" or "" The Stranger Wore a Gun "" . Filmed in Technicolor , the print I viewed was rather garish at times , offering orange colored gunshot bursts and blue hued night time scenes . As a chronicle of the actual story of the Reno Brothers I would have to reserve judgment , as I don't know enough of the historical facts to have an opinion .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
5,"Text1: The sequel to X-Men is here and is arguably better than the first ! Though I like both films and I can't decide which is better but both are great and that's awesome ! The first was a dark and mysterious film and X2 is a thrilling action sequel ! There are more characters in this one though Toad and Sabertooth are not in it but there are plenty of others that are just as cool ! The music is by John Ottman this time around and not by Michael Kamen . People may think Ottman's score is more fitting for the sequel than what Kamen composed for the prequel but I think Ottman's score sounds similar like the original score by Kamen which in My opinion is good for the movie ! The acting in the film is top notch and so is action and also the special effects ! Below is an In-depth look at the characters of the film X2 : X-Men United ! The characters ! Hugh Jackman as Wolverine - Still searching to find out who he is , Logan as he is called finds an empty base up in the great north but it appears empty as it hasn't been used for some time . Since the base is empty and his questions remain will this great fighter return to Professor Xavier back in the states and seek his help or will Wolverine search else where on his own ? Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier - The powerful minded leader of the X-Men goes with Scott Summers to check on how Xavier's old friend Magneto is doing . How is he doing ?

James Marsden as Cyclops - Still protective over his girl Jean Grey , Scott Summers prefers not to interact with Logan simply because Summers thinks that Wolverine wants Grey to but is this the case ? Famke Janssen as Jean Grey - Jean Grey is more powerful minded now and her mind is almost as great as Professor X ! If there is a time that the X-Men are in danger will she save the X-Men from an unspeakable situation ? Halle Berry as Storm - The Egyptian beauty goes on a mission with Jean Grey on the X-Jet . When enemy jet fighters attack she produces incredible storms but will this be enough to stop the enemy ? Anna Paquin as Rogue - Rogue has a more developed relationship with Iceman since time has gone on . Still wearing gloves since she cannot touch anyone and this makes her relationship with Bobby Drake difficult . Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique - The beautiful shape shifting Mystique is back and returns as Senator Kelly . The master metamorph changes into many others to her advantage . Does she and Magneto join their enemies ? Since she fought and was defeated by Wolverine will she fight him again and have revenge or will she do something else ? Does she have a relationship with Nightcrawler ? Does she and Rogue have a relationship of some kind and if so what kind would Rogue have with the blue skinned beauty known as Mystique ? Kelly Hu as Yuriko Oyama - The bodyguard like fighter for William Stryker is quiet but an incredible looking woman . Lady Deathstrike finally faces off with Wolverine and reveals that she is not afraid of him . She battles with each of her long extracted fingers of steel !

Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler - Born in Germany and raised by a Gyspy woman , Kurt Wagner went into the circus but when it changed to new ownership he then later was going to be put in a freakshow and he decided that is not his destiny . Even though this mutant known as Nightcrawler resembles a demon of ancient times he is quite peaceful and in fact studies to be a man of God . Wagner is very agile and is capable of teleporting from area to area . With his German accent and kind personality he joins Storm and Jean Grey onto their mission ! Daniel Cudmore as Colossus - Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin who is also known as Colossus is a huge strong man and he has the ability to change his body into steel like covering . This steel also makes him have incredible strength ! I love the X-Men films and I would really like this franchise to be a trilogy or even a saga ! There is so much more that Bryan Singer can do with his projects especially since he has a great cast and knows how to make great movies ! I hope you have enjoyed this In-depth look at X2 : X-Men United !

Text2: This is a very well made war movie , though I've got to admit that this is a genre that usually doesn't do that much for me . What sets this movie apart is its strong desire for realism - - instead of a Hollywood version of war , this WAS war as it really appeared . Fanatics who love realism will really be pleased about this . Plus , it focuses on the Korean War , a period in our history that is generally ignored in movies . Gregory Peck does a fine job in the lead , though I thought he looked a little old to be such a fine career soldier and only a lieutenant . At his age , he could have easily been playing colonels or even a general . The supporting cast are a lot of then unknowns who later went on to more visible careers .

8,"Text1: BIG musical adaptation of the popular Broadway show . Matchmaker Dolly Levi ( Barbra Streisand ) is in love ( God knows why ) with Horace Vandergelder ( Walter Matthau ) . Naturally he hates her . Also involved are Cornelius Hackl ( Michael Crawford ) and his pal Barnaby ( Danny Lockin ) and their love for Irene Malloy ( Marianne McAndrew ) and Minnie Fay ( E . J . Peaker ) . A textbook example of how NOT to adapt a Broadway show . For starters , Streisand is far too young for the lead role ( even though she's the only thing worth seeing ) - - Carol Channing should have gotten it . The dances and musical numbers - - there are too many of them , they're HUGE and far too long . They go on and on and on and on . I ended up skipping to the next chapter on my DVD . All the dancing was great but it was overkill . Also Matthau and Streisand hated each other - - it comes through loud and clear . Matthau is terrible . Also Crawford and Peaker overact to an embarrassing degree . On the plus side - - it IS colorful , McAndrew was delightfully as Malloy , Lockin nicely plays Barnaby and it was GREAT to see Louis Armstrong pop up briefly . But Barbra is the whole show - - she's young , full of energy and belts out the songs full force . She also shows her incredible comedic skills - - some of her scenes are hilarious . Streisand herself said she was all wrong for the role ( age-wise ) but doesn't let it affect her acting . When she's on screen the movie leaps to life - - - but it's not enough to save it . The endless musical numbers numb you after a while and I was getting bored by the last half hour . Director Gene Kelly obviously thought shoving dance numbers in the publics face would work . It didn't . This was a big budget flop for 20th Century Fox . This was made in the late 1960s when all the movie studios were making big expensive musicals thinking that was what the public wanted . . . and they all bombed . This is not a good movie but worth seeing for Streisand . I can honestly only give it a 6 .

Text2:  The Kiss  is actually just a rudimentary & simplistic witchcraft story about supernatural powers getting passed through the female members of the same bloodline , but director Densham neatly polishes up the concept with impressively explicit make-up effects ( courtesy of Chris Walas ' company ) , adequate supportive character drawings and atmospheric building up towards the death scenes . The story opens in the early 60's in the Belgian Congo , where two sisters become separated at the train station . The youngest one , Felice , is seriously ill but her aunt miraculously cures her by passing an alien-like creature into her body through a kiss . 25 years later the other sister tragically dies in a car accident , leaving behind a husband and a stunningly beautiful adolescent daughter named Amy . Aunt Felice shows up again ( in the ravishingly matured version of Joanna Pacula ) and quickly works her way into the family by seducing her widowed brother-in-law . Auntie Felice is clearly just interested in Amy's body as the host for the inheritable creature , and she won't hesitate to use violent voodoo tricks against anyone that stands between her and the young girl . "" The Kiss "" is one modest class above the majority of 80's witchcraft-movies , because it features a little more directorial flair and style . There's a continuously pleasing level of suspense and film is suitably gruesome , including images of people burning alive , losing body parts underneath trucks and getting strangled on escalators . Felice has an OTT grotesque wild cat assisting her to kill people and there's a bizarre ( but macabre ) montage showing Amy menstruating in class whilst her father makes love to the sinister aunt . That was quite an awkward moment , and I'm not entirely sure about the symbolic significance / importance of that sequence . In fact , there's quite a lot of sexual innuendo that appears to be a bit lost in the wholesome of the story . Anyway , the story grows increasingly sillier near the end , resulting in a highly implausible and chuckles-inducing finale . Meredith Salenger was truly adorable girl in the late 80's ( and still a gorgeous woman today ) and I severely regret the fact her career didn't skyrocketed after this film . Recommended to watch at least once , particularly if you appreciate feminine beauty and graphic gore .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
9,"Text1: Why is it , that when Hollywood wants to make a children's movie , they immediately jump to the conclusion that it has to be childish ? You can make perfectly good children's movies that people over the age of six can watch , too , you know . Just look at The Neverending Story , or several of Disney's productions . This movie just does everything wrong . Instead of doing good humor , they settle for some cheap slapstick comedy , coupled with gross-out comedy , and to add that final flavor of crap , some childish comedy . The main character is in no way likable , not even the least bit ; he's annoying , a jerk , a retard , he has the social skills of an infant and worst of all , he keeps destroying things beyond repair , only to blame it on someone else ( on a similar note ; am I the only one who thinks that "" it wasn't me "" is ripped from Steve Urkel's "" did I do that ? "" or Bart Simpson's "" I didn't do it "" ? Lastly , both of those catchphrases are far superior and much more entertaining than the one from this lame movie ) . The ' love ' story is unlikely and obviously just thrown in to take up screen-time and to not disappoint that little group of emotionally disturbed people who can't watch a movie that doesn't end with the unlikely hero winning the girl , no matter how ludicrous a case it is . The plot is about as nonsensical as they come , and is merely put together to allow for plenty of painfully unfunny "" comedy "" scenes . The characters are clichés . The acting is so far below average that it's ridiculous . Everything about this movie is lame and unfunny . Pity , too , because Dumb and Dumber proved that Harland Williams can be funny , if only mildly . In this he's just juvenile and annoying . I wouldn't even recommend this to kids , as it's simply so bad . The special effects look hideous , too , and are really directly embarrassing to professional movie-making . This could have been made in the 60's , and it would have looked better . The humor is childish and lame , there wasn't one single moment throughout the runtime where I as much as smiled at a joke or gag . The jokes and gags are forced and try way too hard to be funny , and just end up looking embarrassing to the cast and the filmmakers , who , surely , can do better than this pitiful waste of time and energy . The runtime is barely 90 minutes , yet it's incredibly hard to sit through . I urge you , please , avoid this like the plague . It's more bad than you can possibly believe . I recommend this to no one , not even kids ; well , actually , if you're a parent and you need your kid to leave you alone for about 90 minutes , put this on , and just avoid even catching a glimpse of it . That's the only possible use I can come up with for this unbelievably bad "" movie "" . If you do have it , if you rented it on VHS or DVD , I only have one suggestion ( apart from the above mentioned one and of course returning it as soon as humanly possible ) ; fast-forward about 45 minutes into the film , where there is played a good , old-fashioned rock song , something 60's or 70's , I'd guess . That's the one redeeming quality of this film , and it's not even enough to bring the rating up from the lowest score of one .

Text2: I've never understood this type of spoof movies . You get some serious / semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart-jokes and such . We've seen it many , many times , and it's never really been funny . It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand , in my opinion . This seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre , though I honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of Spy Hard or Hot Shots . This movie , as is clearly understood simply from the title , concentrates on making childish fun of Pulp Fiction . That's the main reason I decided to watch it , as I found that film to be overly indulgent of Tarantino's sick mind and powerfully overrated . I had hoped for one or two good jokes , making fun of the overly violent and pointless type of movie that Pulp Fiction was in every aspect , in my ( anything but ) humble opinion . I was sorely disappointed . The plot is pretty much a rip-off of Tarantino's film , with a few scenes spoofing other , often better , films , in the same childish and humorless fashion . The pacing is poor , and often you'll sit there , being able to guess the outcome of every scene , predicting every joke , often thinking of a better one at the spot , bored out of your mind . The acting is bad . The characters are clichés and stereotypes , and are intentionally paper-thin in order to make fun of the characters they're based on . . . problem is , it doesn't work . It just makes the movie that much harder to sit through . The humor is juvenile and lame . The only positive thing I can say about this film is that they managed to find some actors that looked like the people they were supposed to look like . The film is an awful waste of the actual real actors involved . Possibly slightly entertaining to fans of the typical spoof movies of the same kind . I recommend this only to people who truly loathed Pulp Fiction , or fans of the Zucker parody films . Everyone else : avoid .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Can the movie really be over thirty years old ? This flick is as refreshingly funny as when it first came out , and a wonderful showcase for the comedic talents of everyone involved . Even though the entire film is hilarious , I'm sure most viewers have their favorite bits . I bust a gut whenever I hear Igor's ( Marty Feldman ) ' take the bag response ' .

The film begins with Coulouris going to the Amazon and experiencing some sort of horror - - though the film blacks out and then he's suddenly back in merry old England several years later . Now he's spending all his time on his estate doing really stupid experiments that call for a native drummer from South America and a really , really cheesy tree that obviously has actors inside it . This tree was not the cute apple pie tree from McDonalds or the cranky tree like in the WIZARD OF OZ . No , it was a life-stealing , moving tree that was sure to elicit laughs from everyone seeing this film .

But , instead of working , the bad guys started trying to kill each other and the tree was set ablaze and the audience felt very thankful this stupid mad scientist film was finished ! !

In the typical tradition of Simon , Stapleton wonders why her husband couldn't be more original since all men have affairs with their secretaries . Matthau stars in the second story as well but this time with Barbara Harris . As a Hollywood producer , he has come to N .

Matthau is quite funny here with his attempt to be suave and slick . While constantly changing her times of departure , Harris is hilarious while becoming quite inebriated from the liquor that Matthau serves up . Yet , this is the weakest of the 3 stories since you can't await for that bedroom scene that invariably takes place . Guess that Harris ' marriage to Larry isn't as great as she made it out to be after all . In the 3rd segment , Matthau and Lee Grant star as a couple whose daughter is about to be married at the hotel . Trouble is she has wedding jitters so she locks herself in the bathroom . A very funny routine is establish by Matthau and Grant attempting to get her to come out and get married . It is only when her husband-to-be is summoned , he solves everything by telling her to "" cool it . "" So , here we see the generation gap is action .

Text2: At first , I wasn't too thrilled about this movie because of Cab's rough treatment of Minnie ( Jeni Le Gon ) and her insolent attitude in return . And the idea of Calloway going to an audition arranged by his manager Nettie ( Ida James ) when , at this point in his life , he had already entertained millions of people in several movies , on radio , and in concerts makes this very much a plot for the birds . Good thing then that not too much time is spent on the "" story "" though Minnie's tragic end was a little touching with Cab granting her last wish . From then on , it's just a variety show starring Cab with his orchestra along with The Peters Sisters ( a talented group of full-figured women singers ) , and the tap-dancing Millers and Lois ( their tap routines are some of the best I've seen ) . While just every number performed by the Hi-De-Ho man is great , he's especially compelling on the "" St . James Infirmary "" number . And seeing the wedding number with Cab , Ida without the glasses , and Augustus Smith as the preacher makes an excellent finale for the picture . So on that note , I highly recommend Hi-De-Ho ( 1947 version since Cab previously made a couple of shorts with this name , one of which I reviewed in February ) . P . S . David Betha who plays the Brass Hat Owner here was previously in The Green Pastures ( another movie I reviewed in February ) as Aaron , Ms . Le Gon was born in my birth town of Chicago , Ill . , Mr .

So you can't expect another "" Basic Instinct "" here : the erotic parts are tame , and the direction has little cinematic style . The movie clearly counts on its plot and its actors to maintain your interest ; the plot does , but it's nothing brilliant ( there are , after all , only two suspects for the killings ) , apart maybe from the killing method , which is indeed quite unique . The actors are clearly the best thing about "" Flirting With Danger "" , and provide some eye-candy ( for both sexes ) . Charisma Carpenter , one of the most uniquely beautiful actresses out there , with a smile that's at once sweet and naughty , plays the main suspect / love interest for the hero James Thomas , and Victoria Sanchez gives an appealing and believable performance as his childhood friend who may have deeper feelings for him . Despite his dilemma ( or should that be trilemma - Karen Cliché is also around , as the other suspect ) , Thomas is a lucky man - but will he live long enough to enjoy his luck ? You probably know the answer to that one , but "" Flirting With Danger "" is still an OK way to pass 90 minutes . ( )

Text2: This spellbinding movie from that spellbinding film-making team ( Powell and Pressburger ) is another entry in the long line of literary and film stories that revolve around British restraint and repression unraveling under the force of mysterious foreign cultures ( usually Eastern and frequently Indian ) , and it's one of the best . A group of nuns travel to the Himalayas to do missionary work among the natives , but instead find themselves coming under the mystical spell of the place and people around them . Deborah Kerr is stunning as the head nun , who's determined to maintain order and British civility at all costs . I still can't decide whether this or "" The Innocents "" ( 1961 ) gave her her best role . At the other extreme is Kathleen Byron's Sister Ruth , who renounces her vows , paints her lips bright red , and engages in a fierce battle of wills with Kerr . What follows is a film that is surprisingly sexual , erotic and wild . Powell and Pressburger are experts at using color . Instead of employing their Technicolor to simply make their film look pretty , the color almost becomes a character in itself , creating a feverish , hyper-realistic glow to the film . Legendary cameraman Jack Cardiff is responsible for the sterling and Oscar-winning cinematography . Equally stunning is the art direction , which created very realistic mountains out of papier-mache . A simply sensational film , one that holds up completely and could be watched again and again .

It's sort of in a really cheesy , stupid way funny too , and I couldn't get enough of it not only as a fan of the Incredibles but in what it was spoofing too . The moving ' human ' mouths over the bad animated faces reminded me of the cartoons from the 60s - definitely the inspiration - the kind that were featured very briefly and oddly on a TV screen in Pulp Fiction . Story ? There is none , really , Mr . Incredible and Frozone go to stop some Lady-bug lady or other from making traffic a means to conquer the world . The big joke in all of this is there is basically next to no REAL animation here , and coming in the same package as a film so complex in its CGI stylizations and wonderment like the Incredibles , it's a really hilarious , spot-on work that mocks it greatly . I wonder really if kids younger than I will really understand the big joke about it , but for the parents or other adults and teens and others who bought the DVD , the joke might not be lost on them . It's all one big goof , basically , but it's made even funnier when listening to the audio commentary track , where Craig T . Nelson and Sam Jackson - as the characters - comment on this TV pilot that never actually aired in the US , and how embarrassed Frozone gets seeing all of this , particularly with a very random rabbit that keeps getting a close-up to bounce up and down ( eventually even the at-first defensive Mr . Incredible has to stop and says it stinks more or less ) . In fact , I'd say I laughed even harder during the commentary than I did during the actual short itself , as Jackson in the Frozone character really got to some points that I didn't expect , like saying that the creators of the TV show made his Frozone white , or rather ' tan ' .

Text2: Robert Altman and Garry Trudeau didn't quite hit it out of the park on Tanner on Tanner , but that's mostly in trying to compare it to the sprawling brilliance of the original Tanner 88 . Maybe part of that is because the ensemble nature ( as a given for almost any Altman production ) is broken down a little more and we're left mostly on the trail of Tanner's daughter , Alex , who is a documentary filmmaker - cum - documentary - film professor who is making "" My Candidate "" , a doc on her father's failed 88 campaign . In a strange way it works almost in spite of how the character comes off ; Alex Tanner can stand up right alongside Miranda on Sex and the City as the two ( can't say it on IMDb ) "" B-word "" - iest characters Cynthia Nixon has ever portrayed . The difference this time , I think , is in a consistency with the character's trials and tribulations as a "" Mad Filmmaker "" and how it's a logical extension of her original role in the mini-series . Nixon is very good in the role , even when we just want to scream "" stop whining , you're at the Democratic Convention ! "" As with Tanner 88 , we get a whole host of cameos ( my favorites being Martin Scorsese , Chris Matthews , Mario Cuomo , Al Franken and Ronald Regan Jr all for various reasons ) , and some familiar faces like Pamela Reed as TJ . But what's really fascinating about the TV special ( not exactly a mini-series , but not a TV movie quite either ) is how Altman digs about as deep into the psychology of film-making as he did in the Player - this time with a more hands-on approach . There's once again the young observer , quiet and with a curious eye almost akin to Altman's , filming all of the little things as Alex tries to shoot her movie , and there ends up being a scene , a great one in fact , where two women named Alex and both daughters of democratic hopeful candidates ( one Kerry one Tanner ) schedule an interview with Regan Jr , only to find they have to conduct it at the same time . This , on top of another scene where Alex's crew runs into a documentary film crew doing a documentary on documentaries , makes it about as close to "" Factories in Chicago making miniature models of factories "" from Austin Powers as comically possible without overstating the message . There's also some topical stuff thrown throughout , and some uncomfortable bits and some nice foreshadowing watching it four years later ( i . e . Kerry's "" if he wins Tanner may become this and that "" plot points , and Obama's key-note address shown as the event it was ) , and Altman and Trudeau are able to convey , often vividly , how to create a layering effect of politics , media , film-making , family and creative strife , and the pure and cruelly paradoxical nature of the political machine . If it's not quite as focused all the time , or always with a clear story arc , as in Tanner 88 it makes up for its faults with superb performances - as if sliding back into comfortable slippers - and a few bitingly satirical surprises ( Robert Redford anyone ? )","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Noah seems to know where to cast his line with good results . He meets the lovely widow of a soldier that has committed suicide .

Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director . Jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming . Not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell , as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras . Jeanne has problems with the two principal actors , especially , the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie ; the lead actress is no angel either . Movie making , Ms . Breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art . First , there is the writing period , in which , in this case , Jeanne , has written a screen play , that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer / director didn't think about . There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact . What appeared clever in the written page , doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera . The actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man . The luminous Anne Parillaud is marvelous as Jeanne , the director . She makes observations about the production , the actors , and the crew that fit well into the story being told . Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the lead actors , with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set . Jeanne has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end . Ashley Waninnger plays Leo , Jeanne's assistant . "" Sex Is Comedy "" allows Ms . Breillet to give us her own take on films in general . This is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical Breillat style .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
19,"Text1: Bela Lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit ( which was also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain . ) Lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way . Here Chandu returns from the East in order to help the Princess Nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of Ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult . This is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun . To be certain the pacing is a bit slack , more akin to one of Principals ( the producing studios ) features then a rip roaring adventure , but it's still enjoyable . This plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that "" hey I missed something "" . One of the trilogy of three good serials Lugosi made , the others being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps

Text2: Franco Nero stars as Django a drifter who pulls a coffin behind him in a western that spawn well over 50 pseudo-sequels and influenced film makers around the world . What a strange film . Barely released in the US this film is a good spaghetti western that isn't as wild as I'm sure it was in the day it was new . The plot has Django rescuing a woman from two different groups of men to get and then heading off to settle a score with a Major in an all but deserted town . Its a wild trip that for the first two thirds is a twisty western that makes you wonder what in the hell is really going on . The last half hour is a bit of a disappointment in that the twists seem unmotivated and just strange to be strange , although to be honest some of the twists are pretty cool . This is a gritty dirty western with a wicked sense of humor and a good way to spend 90 minutes . You'll for give me for not really critiquing it more than that but its hard to talk about some of what happens with out it either sounding unexciting or without giving too much away .

The late Leslie Crowther had worked with writer Ronnie Taylor before on the popular ' My Good Woman ' , co-starring Sylvia Syms .

22,"Text1: SPOILERS Love works in strange ways on people who become hopelessly overwhelmed by it . In the case of former San Francisco Post lonely hearts columnist Kathy Ferguson , Barbara Stanwyck , it lead to disastrous and fatal results . On top of her game as one of America's top advisory , in personal problems , columnists Kathy got stung by the love bug when she laid her pretty eyes on tall handsome and not too talkative-the strong and silent type - L . A policeman Lt . Bill Doyle , Sterling Hayden . Bill together with his partner Capt . Charlie Alidos , Royal Dano , came to see Kathy at her job to get information of one of her fans who just happens to be wanted for murder back in Los Angeles . It didn't take long for Kathy to not only give Bill the information of the murder fugitives whereabouts , after his boss Capt . Alidos left on a wild goose chase , but fall heads over heels for him . Turning down a high paying job offer to work in New York City Kathy instead married Bill and moved to L . A . Living the boring life of a 1950's suburban housewife Kathy soon realized what a mistake she made in throwing away her career in the newspaper business for the laid back and not all that ambitious , in going up the ladder as a cop , Bill Doyle . Determind to get Bill promoted at all cost to captain Kathy went as far as getting romantically involved with his boss Inspector Tony Pope , Rymond Burr . Pope took Kathy's interest in him as one of the perks , he had a scrapbook filled with his many affairs , of his job as a top man in the LAPD . Kathy feeling both humiliated and insulted in Pope dropping her like a hot potato after she put out for him , to get her husband promoted to be his assistant , really went a bit nuts when he gave the job she put out for to Bill's partner Capt . Alidos ! It's then that Kathy secretly started to embroil Bill with his partner Capt . Alidos over herself . Kathy did this by planting letters supposedly written by Capt . Alidos accusing her as being a home wrecker and even hinting that she's having an affair , which was true , with a member of the LAPD . Outraged at what Alidos did Bill confronted him at the police station and laid him out-with a straight right - giving him a king size shiner ! Pope knowing that he-not Capt . Alidos-in fact was the reason for Bill's anger tried to smooth things over . Pope did this by getting Bill off the hook and possibly having him canned from his job . Kathy still trying to get Pope to promote Bill , she should have been happy that he was still on the police force , later hysterically confronted Pope at his home . It was there and then , when Pope told her to get lost , that Kathy's emotions took over her common sense . This later put her husband Bill in the unenviable position to bust her in one of the most sensational murder cases in the LAPD's history ! If Kathy was as in love with Bill as she at first thought she was his being a cop , and a lieutenant on top of that , shouldn't have been an obstacle in her love for him . He provided Kathy with the home and security which almost any middle class woman would be more then happy with . Bill also provide Kathy with the unconditional love , despite her always putting him down , that she always longed for . It was Kathy-not Bill - who made the big mistake by marrying him and sacrificing her career in doing that . And it was her that Kathy should have blamed for the boring life , as a suburban housewife , that she choose to have even though at the time she did't realize just how boring , to her , it would be !

Text2: SPOILERS Sad but touching made for TV movie involving teenage suicide and it's effects on the person's-who killed himself-family and friends . As both his parents Maggie & Sam Stapp , Meredith Baxter & Bruce Davison , thought their 18 year-old son Jimmy , Peter Facinelli , had everything going for him in school where he's a straight A student and on his high school soccer team where he's the star player . Both of Jimmy's parents didn't quite notice the sever depression that Jimmy was going through until it was too late . That's when Jimmy took his dad's licensed . 38 caliber handgun loaded it with ammunition , that he bought at the local sporting good store , and quietly blew his brains out , This while his parents as well as little sister Rosie , Mea Withman , and brother Billy , Ryan Slater , were attending Sunday Church services ! In trying to cope with his great loss Jimmy's father Sam Stapp just went into a shell in him not as much as going outside to buy the groceries or newspaper . That had Jimmy's mother Maggie become not only the breadwinner for the Stapp family but psychiatrist , in looking after her almost helpless husband Sam , as well . It was Maggie's reluctance to face the truth about her dead son Jimmy in that he in fact killed himself not that he died due to an accidentally shooting , as Maggie always insisted , kept both her and Sam , as well as little Rosie and Billy , from excepting the reality of Jimmy's emotional problems that lead to his suicide . The truth about what made Jimmy kill himself came out in Maggie trying to blame the very people , at school , who tried to help Jimmy while he was still alive : His teacher Susan Johnson , Tina Lifford and school principle Mr . Davies , Raye Birk , as well as his school appointed psychiatrist Dr . Walters , Zeljko Ivanek . It turned out that Jimmy was just giving up on his schoolwork and his training for the school soccer team and going into a deep depression . It's never explained in the film what made Jimmy act this way only that he seemed to have suffered from burn out in trying to please his parents and make them proud of him . Even the letters that his teacher and principle sent to his parents were intercepted by Jimmy who forged his mom's signature making it look like she , and Sam , got word about her very troubled son . It took a lot for Maggie to accept her son's Jimmy's suicide which almost wrecked her family with Sam and the kids , Rosie & Billy , at one point in the movie leaving Maggie in order to get away from her constant quarrels with them over Jimmy . With Sam's insistence Maggie was finally persuaded , after at first refusing , to get help by attending a support group of persons who lost a loved one because of them killing themselves that had her overcome Jimmy's tragic death . The death of someone close to you is tragic enough but when that person took his , or her , own life makes it that much worse . Maggie in her effort to convince herself that her son's death was somehow an accident didn't help her in the fact , suicide or not , that he was no longer with her . It also made her husband Sam an emotional cripple in , by her constantly hinting at it , that it was his gun that caused Jimmy's , either suicide or accidental shooting , death . It was with the help of Sam and the people in the support group that Maggie finally accepted Jimmy's killing himself and thus was able to put it behind her and go out and face what the future held for her .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
23,"Text1: Turner Classic Film network was showing several "" before the Hays Code "" films from the 1930s last night , and I was able to watch this 1931 version of the Robert Sherwood play WATERLOO BRIDGE . Actually this version is closer to the original , written with the background of World War I in mind , than the classic 1940 Robert Taylor - Vivian Leigh version . But the latter has gotten exactly that status - it is a "" classic "" film , because Leigh was the star of the horizon at that moment in 1940 . She just won the Oscar for Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND , and this gave the studio the impetus to pull out the stops . Top notch cast and director , as well as better film productions assets . Ironically , looking at the cast for the 1931 film , it suffers . Yes it is by James Whale . . . but his best recalled films are FRANKENSTEIN , THE INVISIBLE MAN , and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN - hardly love stories . He did do the 1936 SHOWBOAT , but that seems an accident to his career . Such is the damage a good reputation can sometimes do to fully appreciate everything that the person did to earn his or her reputation . The stars of this are Douglas Montgomery ( here named Kent Douglas ) and Mae Clarke . Mae is immortal for one moment on film . In the middle of an argument over breakfast with her bored boyfriend Jimmy Cagney ( in PUBLIC ENEMY ) he pushes a grapefruit into her face ! She was a fine actress , but hardly of star quality . As for Montgomery , he was an above capable performer too , but his smooth , blond , bland features did not go very far . I suppose his best known part was in Katherine Hepburn's LITTLE WOMEN as "" Laurie "" the boy in the house next door who falls for Jo . I feel his best performance is in the 1935 MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD . He also played Stephen Foster ( whom he resembled a little ) in the forgotten early biography MELODY LANE . Two other performers in the cast are worth noting . One is old Frederick Kerr , here playing Montgomery's step-father , a doctor and major in the British Army , who spends most of the film in the countryside , enjoying his fine old port and going through one of those "" What . . . what "" characters , which were supposed to represent the kindly old , eccentric British upper classes . He played a similar role ( albeit as a German ) as Baron Frankenstein ( Colin Clive's father ) in FRANKENSTEIN , so I take it Whale liked his screen personae . The other , ironically , is Bette Davis . She is Montgomery's sister , and ( aside from shouting into her deaf step-father's ear to repeat what he claims he did not hear ) she has little to do . It was her third film . Davis later said ( in her partial autobiography MOTHER GODDAMN ) that she would have loved to play Myra . She did - more memorably - as Mildred , the waitress turned prostitute in OF HUMAN BONDAGE . Actually Clarke is very appealing as Myra . At the start of the film she is shown on the closing night of a West End Musical ( she was in the chorus ) , and Whale is clever enough to show her yawning at one point ( it does add to the realism of that moment ) . In the remake , Leigh was a promising ballerina whose romance with young Taylor causes her teacher ( Maria Ouspenskaya ) to throw her out of the troupe . The idea of chorus girls apparently was not classy enough for Leigh's screen personae in 1940 . Myra can't find another show to get into ( it's wartime , and there have been cut-backs in productions ) . Ironically , she tells her friend Kitty ( Doris Lloyd ) she could have been in the chorus of CHIN CHIN CHOW but chose the other show . It's like having the chance to do HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS , but opting for MR . PRESIDENT . CHIN CHIN CHOW set a West End record in the late teens and early 1920s . Because she can't get back into a show Myra - facing financial necessity - turns to prostitution . She is at Waterloo Bridge when she meets Montgomery during a zeppelin air raid ( Waterloo Bridge is a favorite spot to pick up "" Johns "" ) . The two of them end up going to her apartment by taxicab ( shades of Eliza Doolittle there ) . And they fall into love over a dinner of fish and chips . But Myra can't bring herself to confess what she does for a living - Montgomery is a naive American whose mother married an English country doctor . He does not have any idea about whores . Myra is somewhat older , and she too is American ( her parents were two alcoholics in East St . Louis , which is also the area Barbara Stanwyck comes from in the next film BABY FACE ) . She's more aware of the uglier side of life . Myra's moment of realization that she can't marry Montgomery is when she visits his mother , step-father , and sister in the country . His mother ( Enid Bennett ) gently explains that she would not be fit for Montgomery . Bennett does not push Clarke away ( and she does apparently sympathize with her ) , but she brings Clarke back to that reality that she tried to avoid . Clarke flees back to London , but Montgomery follows . Myra can't bring telling him . Instead it is her landlady ( Ethel Griffes ) in a moment of self-interest who reveals the truth - and gets Montgomery's best moment of reaction in the film in her face as a result . There is an element of melancholy in this that Whale succeeded in maintaining to the end and then some . I won't ruin the end of the film , but suffice it to say the love is as doomed as a flowering plant that is transplanted to a desert . It is a worthy film - not up to the later film's production and star quality - but well worth seeing .

As far as a movie about modern man trapped in a prehistoric world goes , The Land Unknown is about average . I really wanted to like this one more , but rating it a is about the best I can do . For the most part , the film is well paced and director Virgil Vogel keeps things interesting . But even at 78 minutes in length , The Land Unknown is not without an excessive amount of padding ? especially at the beginning . Other than the giant T-Rex , the dinosaur effects are surprisingly strong . I was especially impressed with the dinosaur who lived in the water ( sorry , I'm no dinosaur expert so I'm not sure what kind of dino they were going for ) . Very nicely done . And the sets , from the imaginative plant life to the wonderful matte paintings , make the movie look much better than it should . But as good as that special effects were , the previously mentioned T-Rex is pitiful . It's just laughably bad . It's one of the most obvious man-in-a-suit monsters I can remember seeing . And as with seemingly everything else , the acting is hit-or-miss at best . No one really stands out and Shirley Patterson comes across as plain old annoying . In the end , I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to catch The Land Unknown . Even with some of the problems I had with the movie , it's one I plan to revisit in the future . An average Universal film from the 50s is still better than many of the alternatives .

Text2: A photographer and model are flown to a new resort hotel in the middle of the jungle to shoot some publicity photos . The hotel is owned by a ruthless developer who appears to have little regard for the environment or the people surrounding his paradise . He has hired many members of a local tribe to work for him in his hotel . But what the developer hasn't counted on is that the land Paradise House sits on is sacred to the tribe . It's the home of their giant alligator god , Kroona . After the model goes missing , the photographer finds it difficult to convince anyone that something is wrong . Has the model become another sacrifice to Kroona ? The Big Alligator River is a mish-mash of ideas from a lot of other movies . The most obvious influence comes from Jaws . Martino admits on the DVD that Jaws was the inspiration behind this movie . The scenes of kicking legs in the water being stalked by a POV shot or of a large unseen creature attacking a boat or of the alligator's inevitable demise are almost direct rip-offs of Jaws . Among the other influences I noticed was King Kong . A woman being tied sacrificially to a wooden raft is very reminiscent of Fay Wray's plight . As for the alligator , it hardly comes across as realistic . Instead , it looks almost like a stiff rubber child's toy . Victims must remain virtually immobile if the alligator is to get his mouth around their bodies . In recent reviews I've read of Jaws , I've noticed more and more complaints about how "" fake "" the shark looks . I would advise anyone who feels this way to steer clear of Kroona from The Big Alligator River . Beyond the bad special effects , The Big Alligator River features a less than stellar storyline ( it drags in many places ) , generally poor acting ( there are exceptions of course ) , and just plain silly dialogue . But given these weaknesses I can't bring myself to rate this movie any lower . I had too much fun with it and will eventually watch it again . Despite the flaws , I found it to be good cheesy fun . It might not be everyone's cup of tea , but it's mine . On the positive side , The Big Alligator River has one of the best , most enjoyable set-pieces I've seen in a while . The scene where many of the hotel guests are trapped in the water between the alligator on one side and a group of natives throwing flaming spears at anyone attempting to escape on the other side is remarkably effective . Pick your poison ? being chomped by an alligator or being shish-kabobed by the natives . It's the definite highlight of the movie for me .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

28,"Text1: Fritz Lang's second absolute landmark ( after the equally brilliant but completely different ' Metropolis ' ) and also his first opportunity to work with the wonders of sound . And boy , did he ever deliver a great piece of work ! Like the M ( for murderer ) is marked on Peter Lorre's coat , the film M ( for masterpiece ) is branded on cinema history annals for all eternity . Lang's film is a triumph in every possible viewpoint and it covers a lot more genres and elements than just simply the manhunt for a child-molester . SPOILERS The horrors ' M ' handles about is timeless and of all cultures , but yet it'll always remain a taboo subject and for that reason alone Fritz Lang deserves extra praising . In an utterly astonishing way , Peter Lorre portrays Hans Beckert , a child murderer who single-handedly terrorizes four and half million people simply by his uncontrollable urge to kidnap and molest young schoolgirls . The grim and haunting atmosphere is terrifically built up by images of previous Beckert-victims and the disappearance a new unfortunate girl . Her toy rolling of a remote hills . . . a balloon drifting away on the wind . Really simple but extremely efficient methods to reflect the ominous actions that just took place . Other than to focus on the further actions of the killer , Lang turns to the effect this terror has on the city and how the manhunt for Beckert develops . Our director is obviously fascinated by how a police procedure is organized and he serves the viewer a detailed overview of all the steps taken by the investigators . Meanwhile , he grabs the opportunity to forcefully criticize the media's influence and the German law system with both hands . I'd really like to stress that Lang's subtle mockery was a really risky thing to do with the upcoming Nazi-reign , so you can't admire him enough . Due to the constant ( and fruitless ) raids the police are holding in the hope to capture the killer , the criminal underworld begins to lose its profits as well and they start their own manhunt for the killer , assisted by whores , beggars and petty thieves . With the carefully observing eyes all over town , it becomes practically impossible for Becker to satisfy his monstrous needs . The almighty Peter Lorre arrives late in the film every moment he's on screen is a moment worth treasuring . His sad appearance and cruel testimony are sequences that leave no human being unmoved . Lorre is a brilliant actor and this is inarguably one of the most impressive performances of all time . ' M ' features constant tension , outstanding dialogue and stunning camera-work . As said before , Fritz Lang had the opportunity to work with sound for this film and he immediately makes the most out of this . This was the first ' big ' German production that featured sound and it STILL ranks as the title that made best use of it . . . and that sure means something after more than 70 years . There's the chilling and legendary tune Lorre constantly whistles but also the absence of sound Lang uses to portray the besieged city . As you can tell from the above review , ' M ' is absolute must-see and easily one of the most essential productions ever shot . It's light-years ahead of its time and still disturbing after all these years . This film is a mesmerizing portrait about the darkest , most alarming aspects of humanity and yet still it doesn't live up to real-life facts . As you probably know , the plot of ' M ' is based on the whereabouts of the serial killer Peter Kürten who brutally murdered many victims in the city of Düsseldorf . I read a biography on Kürten recently and the true details of his crimes and animal-lusts go beyond every filmmaker's wildest imagination .

Jean Debucourt ( Roderick ) has a long and distinguished career and appeared in some of my favorite French movies - Douce , La Ciel est a vous , Marguerite de la nuite , Madame de , etc - and is suitable restrained for a silent film when ' emoting ' was de riguer . Anyone who has read anything of Poe let alone the original story will feel at home with this adaptation despite Epstein's cavalier treatment of the story .

29,"Text1: This movie is so bad , it is an insult to all those films it ripped off , particularly Reservoir Dogs , which I didn't even like all that much anyway . I know the director claimed that he never saw any of Tarantino's films , and it actually shows in just how terrible Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was . Let's see , take four or five white guys who look more or less exactly the same , write an overly complicated crime plot , make it as violent as possible , presto , you can impress people with low iqs .

Text2: A teenage British girl ( Jenny Agutter ) and her little brother are taken deep into the Australian Outback by their father for a good , old-fashioned murder-suicide . When the kids get away , the father goes ahead with his own death , figuring they'll probably die in the desert . They last by themselves long enough , but soon an Aboriginal teenager comes upon them and helps them survive . The film is more a collection of images and impressions than a narrative . Roeg likes to compare the savagery of nature with that of civilization . The big problem with the film is that a sexual tension develops between the Aboriginal boy and the white girl . That's actually the main thrust ( excuse the pun ) of the latter half of the film . Honestly , though I'm sure Roeg was being daring for his time , the conceit in itself is pretty racist . The story is basically one of interracial lust , with the white woman interested but unwilling and the black man super-horny for white meat . Really , Aboriginal women do appear in the film , and I would assume that that culture's standard of beauty must be extremely different from our own . And it's funny when the Aboriginal boy , to attract Agutter , does a goofy mating dance to attract her . Perhaps that is how they do it , but to me this little bit animalized the boy to a nasty degree . I should also say that the little white boy , played by Roeg's son Luc , is one of those painful little brats who chatters on endlessly . My thoughts at the beginning , when the father was taking pot shots at him , was that this murder-suicide was entirely justifiable on account of his son's annoyingness . Really , the boy is only there through the rest of the film so the black boy can't bone the white girl . Okay , I have a couple of seemingly major criticisms of the film . Honestly , I enjoyed Walkabout quite a bit . While it's racist attitudes toward sex might be offensive , hell , it is a genuinely erotic film . And it's simply beautiful . Its images are haunting .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

31,"Text1: ' My Sister Eileen ' is based on true incidents . Ruth and Eileen McKenney were sisters from a small town in Ohio who came to New York City : Ruth intending to become an author , Eileen hoping to be an actress . Although Ruth McKenney sold a few magazine pieces , her most successful work was her series of fictionalised articles about the misadventures of her younger sister Eileen . The stories themselves have been out of print for many years , but they provided the basis for a popular play , ' My Sister Eileen ' ( NOT written by Ruth McKenney ) , which was a long-running Broadway hit and which has remained in print ever since . Ruth McKenney ironically gained fame and wealth from a play written by two other people , based on her stories . The real Eileen McKenney ended badly . A pretty actress with more looks than talent , she married the overrated screenwriter Nathanael West and she died alongside him in West's fatal car accident . The 1942 film ' My Sister Eileen ' is a faithful ( and funny ) version of the Broadway hit , although it bears only slight resemblance to the real-life exploits of sisters Ruth and Eileen McKenney ( here renamed Sherwood ) . Rather unusually , this movie was made at Columbia Studios during the play's Broadway run . Two of the best performances here are given by actors repeating their stage roles : Gordon Jones as an obsessive football player named ' The Wreck ' , and Richard Quine as nice young man Frank Lippincott , who fancies Eileen . Small-town sisters Ruth and Eileen come to the big city . Ruth ( Rosalind Russell ) is smart , cynical , and doesn't need a man . Eileen ( Janet Blair ) is naive and pretty and attracts all the lads . Because the sisters haven't got much money , the only place they can afford is a basement flat in Greenwich Village , owned by a crooked landlord named Appopolous ( George Tobias , not up to his usual high standard here ) . The flat is directly above a subway tunnel , where construction workers are blasting with dynamite : at regular intervals , the whole building shakes . Worse luck , the previous tenant was a young lady who ( ahem ! ) rented by the hour , and so Ruth and Eileen are constantly plagued with male visitors who assume that their apartment is still , erm , open for business . Ruth and Eileen have no end of misadventures while trying to start their careers as , respectively , a journalist and an actress . BIG SPOILER STARTING NOW . The last gag in this movie is absolutely hilarious . All through the film , we hear the sounds of the subway navvies directly under Ruth and Eileen's apartment . At the very end of this movie , a jackhammer pokes up through the floor and three construction workers emerge . When they pull off their helmets , we see that they're Moe , Larry and Curly ! Moe lambastes his two ' knucklehead ' workmates while the soundtrack starts playing the ' Three Stooges ' theme tune ! In 1953 , Betty Comden and Adolph Green approached Rosalind Russell to star in a Broadway musical version of ' My Sister Eileen ' with music by Leonard Bernstein , to be called ' Wonderful Town ' . ( The original title wasn't legally available . ) I really dislike ' Wonderful Town ' : it has a score which I consider extremely pretentious . Rosalind Russell , to her credit , had no illusions about her own song-and-dance abilities . ' Wonderful Town ' was never filmed , because Columbia had retained the musical rights . . . and they made their OWN musical version in 1955 , with tunes by Jule Styne that are vastly better than anything "" Lenny "" Bernstein ever wrote . Interestingly , Richard Quine ( who hed acted in the original film and the Broadway cast ) directed the musical remake , and his role as Frank Lippincott was taken over by Bob Fosse , giving his best performance as an actor and choreographing some snappy dance numbers as well . I strongly recommend both film versions of ' My Sister Eileen ' , which is more than I can say for the overrated ' Wonderful Town ' . I'll rate this 1942 version . Well done !

Text2: I had read descriptions of this movie at least 20 years before I first saw it ; inevitably , the movie is a disappointment . Actually , the Lumiere Brothers made at least two different versions of this movie , in different locations with different casts . Its title is usually given in English as ' Watering the Gardener ' . This 1895 effort is the earlier version . SPOILERS COMING . A gardener is using a hosepipe to water the garden . A boy sneaks up behind him and treads on the hose , shutting off the flow . The gardener , of course , peers directly into the empty nozzle to see what's wrong . Cue the boy to lift his foot , restoring the flow and soaking the gardener . Spotting the fleeing boy , the gardener catches him and spanks him . This movie is often cited as the very first film comedy , and it surely qualifies as one of the very earliest . When I'd first read about it , I visualised the boy as being about seven or eight years old at most . In this film ( both versions I've seen ) , he's clearly at least twelve : really too old to be engaged in this sort of mischief . . . and spanking a boy of that age is not so much punitive as something else altogether . I was vaguely intrigued that the hosepipe in this movie is made of some material which causes it to kink into sections rather than flex uniformly . Gutta-percha , perhaps ? The Lumiere brothers ' very earliest movies were simply filmed events : documentary footage . Although this movie's action has clearly been staged for the camera , it's still historically significant as an early attempt to tell a story in the cinema medium rather than merely record events . For that reason , I'll rate this crude soaker .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
32,"Text1: On their way to meet their dad , Frank and Joe Hardy ( Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy ) stop off in Egypt for a little sight-seeing . Before you know it , the boys are mixed up in stolen antiquities and a pretty American girl who has been kidnapped . Can the boys put the pieces together to solve The Mystery of King Tut's Tomb ? More importantly , can they clear their own names and get their passports from the local police ? I admit , The Mystery of King Tut's Tomb isn't earth shattering in its originality , but I had a good time re-watching it for the first time in about 30 years . To begin with , the mystery elements are reasonably good . It's a fairly complicated story ( okay , complicated for a Hardy Boys mystery ? it's all relative ) that takes a bit of time to unfold . And secondly , who doesn't enjoy a bit of mysterious ancient Egypt mixed into a mystery ? I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff . My biggest complaint has more to do with the start of Season 2 than it does this particular episode . First it was Transylvania and Dracula ? now it's Egypt and King Tut . What happened to the more homegrown believable mysteries ? Were the producers that desperate for ratings ? While I don't necessarily think any of the first three episodes in Season 2 are particularly bad , none can compete with the majority of episodes from Season 1 .

Text2: When Hammer began their horror cycle in the 50s , they were smart to begin with what are essentially remakes of two of Universal's most well known and successful films ? Frankenstein and Dracula . Hammer may have started the ball rolling with The Curse of Frankenstein , but to me , Hammer's second , The Horror of Dracula , is the best movie Hammer made and a vast improvement over Universal's iconic Dracula . Why do I call The Horror of Dracula Hammer's best and an improvement Universal's film ? Three things immediately come to mind ? Christopher Lee , Peter Cushing , and the screenplay and direction . While Bela Lugosi may be a more familiar face to the average movie fan , I've always felt that Lee took what Lugosi did and improved on it . The image of Lee with his bloodshot eyes and bared , bloody fangs is a more frightening visage to me than Lugosi's stare . Lee brought athleticism and vitality to the role . He made Dracula a real physical threat . In short , he made Dracula threatening . As with Lee vs . Lugosi , Peter Cushing is an improvement over Edward Van Sloan in the role of Van Helsing . The difference is that here the improvement is more apparent and undeniable . Face it , Sloan was a stiff . As interesting as some of his characters ideas may have been , I could never picture the man doing any real battle with a vampire . Cushing , on the other hand , is a whirlwind of activity . He has the same interesting ideas about vampire folklore , but with a physical presence that can actually stand-up to Dracula . In short , Cushing simply is Van Helsing . Finally , I enjoy the screenplay and direction of The Horror of Dracula more than that of Dracula . Why ? Too much of Dracula seems stage-bound . Everything and everyone seems confined to whatever set they happen to be on . It also doesn't help that much of the direction in Dracula is of the "" plant and shoot "" variety . I realize that this was the case with many early films , but that doesn't mean I like it . In The Horror of Dracula , characters don't feel as confined . Terence Fisher gives the actors the freedom to move . You get the impression that the characters come and go at will . It may be an unfair comparison for movies made some 27 years apart , but this has always been one of my biggest complaints with Dracula . ( For the record , I don't have this problem with most of Universal's other classic films like Frankenstein or The Invisible Man , to give just two examples . ) Hammer made many horror films over the years that I consider to be among my favorites . But none equal The Horror of Dracula . I realize that all I've done here is compare two different versions of the same story , but the comparisons are the best way I can think of to express what I like about Hammer's film . In this day and age of bad horror remakes , it's a little odd to me that my favorite Hammer film is a remake .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: Tom Walls directed and starred in a series of light social comedies written by Ben Travers . These were hugely successful in the 1920s ( and for some years beyond that decade ) , and are collectively known as the Aldwych farces , in honour of the West End theatre that was Walls's and Travers's base camp . The main action of ' A Night Like This ' takes place in a London nightclub which is a front for gangsters . ( I can't believe that any London nightclub would be a front for gangsters . . . not with respectable businessmen like Ron and Reggie Kray making sure that all the nightclub owners stay honest ! ) Cora Mellish ( Winifred Shotter ) is a nightclub dancer who has run up a substantial gambling debt . To avoid having her legs broken ( and losing her livelihood ) she puts up a valuable necklace as security . Unfortunately , Cora doesn't own the necklace : it was loaned to her by her boyfriend Aubrey ( Claude Hulbert ) , but he doesn't own it either ; it actually belongs to his very fearsome aunt ( Norma Varden ) , a battle-axe who would put several of Bertie Wooster's aunts to shame . Into this confusion comes undercover detective Mike Mahoney , played by Walls . While solving the case , he falls in love with Cora . This sets up a triangle with Hulbert , but - - this being an Aldwych farce - - there's never any doubt as to who will get the girl . A large factor in the success of the Aldwych farces was their predictability : audiences wanted stock characters and stock situations , and got what they expected . Here we have thick-ear gangsters , henpecked husbands , silly-ass toffs , and of course a pompous git ( the amusing Robertson Hare ) losing his trousers , thus paving the way for Brian Rix and the Whitehall farces . As a bonus , we get Al Bowlly as the leader of the nightclub orchestra , all of them playing in fine form . The only cast member I didn't like was Mary Brrough ( the British film industry's equivalent to Hollywood's Maud Eburne ) as a shrieking shrew . The entire film is directed very much like a stage play , even to the extent of having the cast take a curtain call at the end ! However , I actually enjoyed this , as it gave me some notion of what it must have been like to see one of these farces at the Aldwych Theatre in George V's day . I'll rate ' A Night Like This ' . Well done all round !","{""output"": ""NO""}"
34,"Text1:  The Last Man on Earth  opens with the desolation of city landscapes betraying not a hint of activity , and bodies lying in the streets . A community church billboard heralds : "" The End Has Come "" . Against this desperation , one man survives and marks time on the walls of his home . For three years he has wearily resigned himself to his mission , to destroy every last vampire within the confines of the city , searching for their resting places in hopes of discovering a large colony he can destroy all at once instead of the one or two he may happen upon at random . Vincent Price portrays Dr . Robert Morgan , curiously immune from the vampire plague . We learn that his tolerance may have occurred years earlier when he was bitten by a bat in Panama , somehow acquiring antibodies in his system to combat the disease . Via flashback sequences , we come to learn that Morgan once had a wife and young daughter , and while working at a medical lab , the plague hit , first in Europe , and then carried wind borne to other parts of the world . The apocalyptic feel of the movie is both effective and discomfiting at the same time . The viewer shares in Morgan's hopelessness and despair , knowing that should he fulfill his mission , there is no relief from the loneliness and boredom of a solitary existence . Having lost his family , and even his dog to the ravages of disease , Morgan is driven not so much by revenge , but by a choice made to make things right in the world even to his last breath . All of your standard vampire lore is explored in the film ; Morgan protects his home with ropes of garlic , and dots his rooms with mirrors . He makes his own stakes for subduing them , and his daily forays into the city show him carrying his equipment and a mallet in readiness for what he may find . Watch for a continuity error early in the film - the first time we see Morgan load his station wagon with dead vampire bodies , he puts them in head first , with feet coming out the back . When he arrives at the burning pit to dispose of them , the one he pulls out of the car is facing him head first . "" The Last Man on Earth "" is not an easy film to watch . It's one of the few "" B "" grade films of the genre that actually make you think about what you might face if you suddenly found yourself in an apocalyptic nightmare . Particularly poignant is my timing to view this film , some eight days following Hurricane Katrina , with it's desolation of New Orleans . The contrast between the leveled landscape of Louisiana with the stark remains of the movie's locale bear an uncomfortable similarity . It's unsettling to realize that a work of fiction can come so close to capturing the mood and despair of an entire region faced with a tragedy beyond it's control . This is not a film to entertain , and there is no happy ending .

Text2: About a third of the way through the picture , I was pretty convinced that Francie ( Grace Kelly ) was the cat burglar , but that might have been due more to some of the set up scenes on the DVD I was watching rather than the story itself . Although there were quite a few hints pointing to her during those double entendre laden conversations she had with John Robie ( Cary Grant ) . But you couldn't be disappointed with the revelation of the real jewel thief , Danielle Foussard ( Brigitte Auber ) displayed her athleticism admirably during earlier scenes , so picturing her rummaging around on rooftops wasn't too much of a stretch . Aside from the actual story , I couldn't help but be impressed with director Hitchcock's choice of locales for the story . The French Riviera setting was nothing short of gorgeous , and I couldn't help rewinding a few scenes just to take in the natural beauty . That Cary Grant was sure one lucky actor when it comes to making pictures , besides starring opposite Grace Kelly that is . It would be a toss up as to which locale was more beautiful , the one presented here , or the Mediterranean vistas on display in "" An Affair To Remember "" . Not being too fussy , I could take either one . You know , if you're really paying attention , you would have to wonder how John Robie managed to leave his home with the clothes on his back , trade them for a pair of swim trunks , and then show up at a flower market in Nice with a new set of duds . It all flows rather smoothly , but gee , how would someone do that ? Maybe the stranger on the bus helped him out . I got a kick out of a line spoken by Francie to Robie regarding his past reputation as a crack jewel thief - "" And you just aren't the Lone Wolf you think you are "" ? I paused to consider whether Hitchcock was paying tribute to the movie character from the 1930's and ' 40's portrayed by Warren William . I like to think so , but anyone know for sure ? Besides the creative dialog , I also found an early scene to be fun when Robie makes his way to the French restaurant where his former colleagues are employed . One of the kitchen workers pours a saucer of milk ! It was here also where Hitchcock decided to deal with his fetish regarding eggs , two separate instances where the ' perfect food ' is dealt with rather harshly - you'll have to watch . For all the clever playfulness in the story , one would be forgiven for not recognizing this as an Alfred Hitchcock film . It's one of his lighter efforts , balancing intrigue and mystery with romance and humor . Perhaps the cleverest bit of amusement had to do with the title of the picture itself . "" To Catch a Thief "" pretty well describes Cary Grant's mission in the story , but it turns out to be Grace Kelly's goal as well , only in a more romantic sense .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

BELA LUGOSI's footage consists of a few glimpses of him walking around in a graveyard while most of the other shots have an actor wearing a black cape subbing for Lugosi who died during production . There's a certain creepy atmosphere to all of the graveyard scenes enveloped by mist and dark lighting and amusement in watching VAMPIRA and THOR go through their paces with hands and arms outstretched , but the film is actually not as much fun as I anticipated . Too many of the scenes are played in a manner that takes itself too seriously and none of it is the least bit convincing . The acting , for the most part , is as cardboard as the sets .

D . : Plague epidemics have wiped out a fair share of the populace and reduced society to a hellish , feral , survival of the fittest kill or be killed barbaric shambles with lethal hordes of Cro-Magnon thugs running amuck on the streets of every major city . In New York a peaceful , barricaded compound led by the wise , kindly Baron ( a beautifully understated Max Von Sydow ) , assisted by the resourceful Cal the Gardener ( a marvelously mellow Richard Kelton ) and his feisty pregnant daughter Melinda ( excellently played by Joanna Miles ) , try to rebuild civilization by creating seeds that are resistant to the various diseases that have ravaged the planet and turned it into a barren wasteland . However , the compound's fragile security is steadily eroding to the point were it can be overrun by the calculatingly malevolent Carrot ( the always fantastic William Smith at his tremendously terrifying , hard-hearted best ) and his gang of grimy , vicious brutes . Enlisting the aid of laconic , resilient , stoical , but essentially humane mercenary and street fighter supreme Carson ( a terrific Yul Brynner in a very ideal piece of casting ) , the Baron has Carson with the seeds and Melinda in tow make a desperate effort to escape by traveling through the dusty , cobwebby , rat-infested subway tunnels to safety . Unarguably the unjustly overlooked and undervalued prototype for the many 80's post-apocalyptic sci-fi / action features that followed in its influential wake ( "" Escape from New York "" in particular immediately springs to mind ; ditto the "" Mad Max "" films ) , "" The Ultimate Warrior "" ranks as a potently grungy , gut-kickingly savage and visceral dilly .

Moreover , Brynner makes the most of his part , adding some surprising sensitivity to his rugged character while Smith hits an all-time nasty peak as the mean , but bright and charismatic villain . The sober , uncompromisingly harsh tone , done with no traces whatsoever of silly camp humor , but several welcome moments of genuine warmth and compassion and Clouse's stark , unflinchingly grim depiction of the ugly , upsetting savagery which permeates the post-holocaust milieu ( for instance , Smith's gang captures a baby from Sydow's compound and use it as bait to lure Brynner outside ) , give the film an extra stinging edge . These two significant factors furthermore bring a certain bleak conviction to the frighteningly violent and totally amoral world shown herein , thereby elevating "" The Ultimate Warrior "" to the respectable status of a truly outstanding and unheralded winner .

Text2: Yeah , this particular enduring ( and endearing ) classic TV special was indeed made over forty years ago , but still retains its magical ability to cast an enchanting spell just the same . It's partly because of the appealing topicality of the central story ( mopey Charlie Brown can't get into the Noel spirit because of the current crass commercialism of the yuletide season ) , partly because the key message makes a significant point about Christmas without ever becoming too preachy or sappy , and mainly because the show itself astutely captures the joy , warmth and humanity of Christmas in a most lovely and moving way . Director Bill Melendez and writer Charles M . Schultz keep things beautifully simple and unpretentious throughout . Moreover , the cast of lovably awkward kid voice actors add a certain clumsy charm to their characters . And what a likable and colorful bunch of characters we have here , starting with the hapless , yet persistent Charlie Brown , highlighted by the marvelously irrepressible buoyancy of the ever-chipper Snoopy , and given an extra lift by Lucy's delicious meanness , the wise-beyond-his-years sagacity of Linus , and the giddy slovenliness of the hysterically filthy Pigpen . The bright and vibrant animation might seem a tad crude by today's more advanced standards , but gets the job done nonetheless . Vince Guaraldi's delightfully jaunty'n'jazzy score hits the rousing spot . The snappy tempo and merry tone are likewise totally on the money excellent . A real treat that should be watched at least once a year around Christmastime .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
40,"Text1: Muddled story with stolen art , American Nazis , and an entire host of things included . Despite a stellar cast , the film suffers from constant confusion . Why was that art dealer killed ? Would we actually think that an elderly Holocaust survivor was trying to fool people with the Veneer portrait ? Do we have to be told that villain Philip Casnoff is thrown off the helicopter he flees to ? Since when does a blonde dish have the name of Agnes ? What an art investigator she is ! Lea Thompson directed and starred in this mess as a housewife who goes on student field trips and also doubles as a secret agent . The mixing of the two is hard to believe as well as realize here . Thompson always has that bit of anger on her face when she is acting . I can't blame her here given the material that she has to work with . Joe Penny , as the cop Frank , is taken in by Agnes , Elaine Hendrix , and he looks entirely confused by all this . Nice seeing William R . Moses in the part of Thompson's husband . Remember him in Perry Mason ? I always wondered what became of him . He is given so little to do in this film .

Driven by a domineering , obsessed with perfection father , Perkins is outstanding in his portrayal . He is equally matched by Carl Malden , terrific as the father . From childhood Perkins is seen as being driven by his father to achieve perfection . Nothing less will satisfy the compulsive driven father . The scene where Perkins goes berserk during a game is memorable . His recovery is well staged as well . My diagnosis would have been to keep his father away but to make sure that the viewers see this wonderful film .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: The Cardiff club scene in the 90's : five best friends deal with their relationships and their personal demons during a weekend . Jip calls himself a sexual paranoid , afraid he's impotent . Lulu , Jip's mate , doesn't find much to fancy in men . Nina hates her job at a fast food joint , and her man , Koop , who dreams of being a great hip-hop d . j . , is prone to fits of un - provoked jealousy . The fifth is Moff , whose family is down on his behaviour . Starting Friday afternoon , with preparations for clubbing , we follow the five from Ecstacy-induced fun through a booze - laden come-down early Saturday morning followed by the weekend's aftermath . It's breakthrough time for at least three of them . . . . if a film can define the clubbing scene from 1995 to 1999 , then this is that movie . Kerrigan has obviously lived part of the main characters lives , and met people like the ones depicted in the film , because this is about the most truthful and honest film about the clubbing scene that has ever been made . the scenarios and mise en scene are so visceral and real , it's the kind of movie that makes you want Friday to come and just go out and party . like the drugs that the group are taking , the film gives you a sense of euphoria and also can be quite melancholy at times . Simms is great as Jip , the kind of guy that everyone wants to be around , and the kind of guy most people want to be . he's out going , get's on well with everyone and is brutally honest about his life . his network of friends are also the kind of people you want to associate with as they all have their unique positives and negatives . along with this , the soundtrack is so good and so vital to the film , that Pete Tong has done probably his best job ever here with choosing the music . it's a great film to watch with mates or feeling low , but you do realise after watching this , that even though you still may think the best weekend your ever going to have could be soon , it might have already happened . you just didn't realise it because of your drug fuelled come down . a classic movie .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
42,"Text1: I would love to briefly explain the plot of It Can Be Done , Amigo , but I don't think I'm capable . It almost defies words with its bizarreness . I'll give it a stab though . Bud Spencer is Coburn , the opposite of what I normally associate with the hero of a Spaghetti Western ( SW ) . He's miles away from the image of the svelte Man with No Name . Coburn is a big man who looks like he may crush the horse he rides . He doesn't carry a gun , but relies on his powerful fists to defend himself . He is entrusted with safely delivering a young boy to his home after the boy's uncle dies . The trip won't be easy as hot on Coburn's heels is a wagon carrying the woman ( Dany Saval ) who insists on marrying Coburn , her brother ( Jack Palance ) who wants to kill Coburn , and the brother's traveling brothel . Once Coburn and the boy reach the boy's home , it seems that everyone in town , including the town's Mayor / Sheriff / Minister , is anxious to get it away from him , whether by buying it or killing to get it . Coburn's got to figure out a way to help the boy keep his land all the while staying one move ahead of his betrothed , her brother , and the Mayor / Sheriff / Minister who will stop at nothing to get the homestead . Whew ! That was difficult . But as confusing and crazy as the plot may sound , in the end , it all makes sense . Bud Spencer , as he proved in his many films with Terence Hill , has a flair for comedy and most of it works . Sure , there are a few misfires along the way , but you can generally count on Spencer to deliver . I cannot say the same for Jack Palance . Unlike almost every other review I've read on It Can Be Done , Amigo , I don't care for Palance in this film . His constant grimaces and sneering really didn't work for me . The rest of the cast is okay with Dany Saval giving a standout supporting performance . As much fun as I had with parts of this film , I can't rate it any higher because of the sluggish first act . The movie starts off at a snails pace and I was really worried I might fall asleep if something didn't happen soon . A little better pacing throughout It Can Be Done , Amigo might have gone a long way to making this a truly memorable SW .

43,"Text1: Although only a few days have elapsed since I've watched this one , I've already forgotten practically everything about it ? as my memories of the film seem to have melted into all the other peplums I've been watching of late ! Obviously , from the title one can gather that it's basically a transposition of the SEVEN SAMURAI ( 1954 ) / THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN ( 1960 ) plot to the Roman Empire ? and the rating suggests that I found it to be a middle-of-the-road peplum , not very good perhaps but not especially bad either . Richard Harrison is the lead here and , while he may not have much range as an actor , at least he's not as wooden as Dan Vadis ; as a matter of fact , over the last week , I've watched two films ? and both , incidentally , turned out to be more or less of the same quality ? by either of these Euro-stars . I do recall , however , that the print utilized for the DVD transfer of GLADIATORS SEVEN was perhaps the best of all the English-dubbed peplums I rented and , surprisingly enough , it was presented in the correct aspect ratio ( unlike the majority of the titles , which were available only in horrendous pan-and-scan editions ) .

Text2: This film ( which I had previously watched several years back on Italian TV but that viewing suffered from very poor reception at times ) is a remake of THE STREET WITH NO NAME ( 1948 ) – which , interestingly , comes from the same scriptwriter ( Harry Kleiner ) , cinematographer ( Joe MacDonald , now adopting color and Cinemascope ) and production designer ( Lyle R . Wheeler , though the setting has been relocated from the U . S . to Japan ) ! The earlier plot line is followed very closely but , apart from this exotic change in locale , there are a couple of other effective differences : whereas in the original the gangster was involved with a woman , here it’s the hero ( which actually heightens the danger prevalent in the undercover operation ) ; incidentally , this time around we only learn his real identity half-way through – while the fact that she is Japanese adds an unexpected but sensitively-handled element of miscegenation . The gangster is essayed by a typically impressive Robert Ryan ( memorably introduced as the hero is almost literally shoved into his lap , his portrayal here is remarkably restrained but grows in intensity as the film progresses ) , Robert Stack , the hero , is well cast as an army investigator ( rather than an F . B . I . agent ) and the woman by an excellent Shirley Yamaguchi ; even so , the gangster’s moll character played by Barbara Lawrence in the 1948 film is present here in the figure of Cameron Mitchell , the outfit’s second-in-command ( suggesting homosexuality – the latter even throws a fit when his role is usurped by new recruit Stack – and , therefore , marking yet another novel / mature aspect in HOUSE OF BAMBOO ; incidentally , Mitchell’s demise is one of the film’s highlights ) ! The role of the hero’s associates – in this case , an amalgam of U . S . and Japanese personnel , embodied by Brad Dexter and Sessue Hayakawa – is much reduced here , while the presence of a second undercover agent ( played in the original by John McIntire ) is omitted entirely ; by the way , in the cast is also Maltese actor Sandro Giglio but , not being overly familiar with his physical features , I didn’t recognize him . Given director Fuller’s involvement , brutality is even more to the fore in this version – while the exciting climax takes place on a larger scale than before i . e . inside an amusement park ; the Widescreen format allows for controlled but striking compositions throughout , particularly during the action sequences ( which include a couple of raids by the gang ) . In the end , the two films are pretty much on a par : the first may have a more genuine noir feel to it perhaps but , at the same time , it lacks the individualistic touch afforded the remake by Fuller’s hand ( who collaborated personally on the script , as was his custom ) – a more stylish but dispassionate approach which keeps close-ups to the barest minimum . It’s worth mentioning here that another valid contribution to the film’s overall value comes courtesy of Leigh Harline’s fine music score . P . S . Just as I’ll probably get to William Keighley’s BULLETS OR BALLOTS ( 1936 ) earlier than expected in view of THE STREET WITH NO NAME , I’ll be giving a spin to a couple of unwatched Fullers as well – namely THE STEEL HELMET ( 1951 ) and RUN OF THE ARROW ( 1957 ) – thanks to this one ; besides , I guess I should make some time for a viewing of THE YAKUZA ( 1975 ) too , being another Oriental noir I’ve long wanted to check out . . .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

45,"Text1:  Inherit the Wind  is based upon the infamous Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 . John T . Scopes , a teacher from Tennessee , was caught spreading the theory of evolution in his classroom . He was taken to court and prosecuted by the highly-respected William Jennings Bryan , an ex-Presidential candidate and popular religious figure , renowned for his fundamentalist views of the Bible . In an astonishing turn of events , defense attorney Clarence Darrow called Bryan to the stand during the trial and quizzed him on Biblical literalism . It set back fundamentalism for a few years as Bryan walked away looking the fool . However , in my opinion - after reading transcripts - the entire process was a bit unfair , as were some of the accusations brought forth by Darrow , whose sole purpose was to gain a reaction out of Bryan by mocking his religious beliefs . Prosecution still won the case , however , since Scopes was on trial for teaching evolution - and in the end , the fact was that he did . In the film , which is loosely based on the actual events of the Scopes Monkey Trial , Spencer Tracey plays Darrow in the form of Henry Drummond , an educated man who thinks fundamentalism is a joke . Matthew Harrison Brady ( Fredric March ) is based on William Jennings Bryan . Stanley Kramer's direction is excellent , the b & w photography is superb and the performances are great . However , my only problem with this film is that it clearly has an agenda - to make a mockery of fundamentalism , Bryan and the entire trial . A LOT of facts are fooled around with - Tracey's character is turned into a smart , educated guy and Brady ( played by March ) is a gluttonous , prejudiced redneck . Tracey gets all the good lines in the script , making March's character look like an utter imbecile - and a thoroughly despicable character . The real trial wasn't quite so one-sided . Although Bryan was certainly left looking worse off between the two of them , the trial never become so heated nor was it as smooth and clever on Darrow's behalf as it is for Tracey in the film . ( I'm particularly speaking about the climax of the film . ) It's an early case of Hollywood taking "" creative liberties "" - it is a very , very good film ; but it's also kind of hard to ignore the blatant bias of the movie . It's not that I am offended by the film because I am a Christian zealot or whatever else other criticizers of this aspect of the film have been called - I just don't like ANY religious group , or historical figures , made out to look like fools when in reality it wasn't exactly so convenient . Other than a few minor quibbles about historical accuracies , "" Inherit the Wind "" is a great film . The performances alone make it worth seeing , and the direction is very good .

46,"Text1: This is arguably Kevin Costner's best film in a long time - I haven't seen too much of his recent work because it was so obviously second-rate / embarrassing but here he's back on track despite a storyline that stretches credibility to breaking point - what are the odds for example that Brooks and Smith would randomly select Atwood's estranged husband and his lawyer as victims or that Atwood would trace Mr Smith to the very fleabag in which the escaped con she put away and who has sworn vengeance is holed up . What carries the viewer along is the understated playing and the novelty of Upright Citizen as Serial Killer when as a rule Serial Killers are dysfunctional loners and almost never Man Of The Year . If it does find itself spinning too many plates in the face of logic - the main strand , Mr . Brook ' Jekyll and Hyde existence is supplemented by 1 ) Mr . Smith witnessing one of his killings and blackmailing him to carry out another to which Smith will be privy , 2 ) Atwood's personal problems with a divorce settlement , 3 ) Atwood's life being threatened by the escaped con and 3 ) Mr . Brooks ' daughter apparently bent on replicating her father's sideline - it manages on the whole to keep this kind of logic at bay leaving us to enjoy some fine acting .

Text2: This is one of the Great ones : In terms of French cinema in the first full decade of Sound it belongs right up there with Marius , Fanny , Cesar , Quai des Brumes , Le Jour se leve , La Femme du boulanger , La Grande Illusion and you can't put anything higher than that though Duvivier's own La Belle equipe and Pepe Le Moko both come within a whisker . It's the kind of film that would be difficult to make today as would , for example , Dial M For Murder . Frederick Knott wrote Dial as a play in the early fifties and the Hitchcock film version was released in 1954 BUT the entire plot ( our old friend the ' perfect ' murder ) hinged on the fact that in those days only the upper and middle classes had telephones at all and those were in fixed locations and in this era of jack points and cell phones the idea of someone obliged to answer a telephone located on a desk in front of heavy drapes behind which a murderer was lurking ready to strike when the phone was answered would be ludicrous . Carnet is similar inasmuch as ' dance cards ' are unheard of today belonging as they do to a world of stately dancing and courtly manners where even a ' nice ' girl would as soon turn up to a dance totally naked as without a ' full ' dance card - many of us will remember how , in Meet Me In St Louis , Judy Garland and Lucille Bremner ' marked ' the dance card of an out-of-towner loading it with every dead-beat in town . So , yes , it is archaic but fortunately those of us who care to can have archaic and eat it courtesy of the Art / Revival House , Movie Channels on TV and / or the DVD . Living by a lake a widow comes face to face with what today we would call a mid-life crisis ; vaguely melancholic and slightly wistful lest she did , as she suspects , marry the wrong man , she allows her thoughts to drift to her first dance and the names on her very first dance card who , on a whim , she decides to trace . WE know of course that you can't go home again even if we've never even heard of Tom Wolfe let alone read him but thankfully Christine feels otherwise . It was a nice touch to find that the first name on the card is dead - but try telling that to his mother , the great Francoise Rosay - as if to say right from the word go that love dies , baby , if you neglect it . One by one via a night-club semi racketeer , a monk , a ski instructor , the mayor of a small town , an epileptic doctor with a lucrative sideline in abortion and a gay hairdresser the scales fall and / or are stripped from her eyes leaving her sadder but wiser . Some of the top names in French cinema step up to the plate , Harry Baur , Louis Jouvet , Fernandel etc and no one strikes out . Henri Jeanson and Julien Duvivier brought honour to the French cinema with this one that remains a must-see and before I sign off let me acknowledge a genuine altruistic contributor to these boards who , with exceptional kindness , sent me not only this gem but seventeen others .

Alternately funny , mawkish and chilling , Nigel Kneale's script also proved typically prescient ? as its depiction of a dumb and seemingly endless franchise revolving around a larger-than-life boogeyman would soon overtake the genre ( a practice which , regrettably , holds to this very day ) . It's commendably marked , too , by good performances across the board ? including such familiar faces as Hammer regular Thorley Walters ( playing an absent-minded thespian ! ) and Patricia Haines , from the underrated THE NIGHT CALLER ( 1965 ) and the abysmal VIRGIN WITCH ( 1972 ) , in the role of the estranged wife of the nondescript actor behind the titular creature ( incidentally , the pathetic latter character evokes memories of Victor Carroon from "" The Quatermass Experiment "" ? another ' human monster ' conceived much earlier by Kneale himself ) .

Equally as good is Kelly McGillis as her attorney trying to prove that not only did the men rape her client , but several other men encouraged the rape . A particularly effective scene is when Foster decides to take revenge on one of the men who encouraged the rape ; you can feel what she's thinking .

50,"Text1: Dead Man is a unique piece of film . As this is my first taste of Jim Jarmusch , I had no idea of what to expect , but even if I had ; I reckon that this film wouldn't have conformed to them . Dead Man is a surreal and trippy western that peels itself away from the staples of the genre and succeeds in creating something truly one-off and self-styled . Lead by a score written by Neil Young , Dead Man is continually satisfying and powerful ; and you get the impression that every scene has been fully thought through , and is perfectly realised as the auteur intended . For this reason , Dead Man captivates it's viewer from the moment it starts until the moment it ends , and as it descends into full blown trippy weirdness , you can do nothing but stare in admiration of this strange gem of cult cinema . The plot is thin on the ground and it largely lacks meaning , but it doesn't matter because Dead Man is a purely aesthetic experience . Still , it follows William Blake ( Johnny Depp ) , an accountant from Cleveland that arrives in a town to take a job offer , only to find that the vacancy has already been filled ? Dead Man is filmed in very stark black and white , which only adds to the surrealism of the story . Had this film have been done in colour , it would not have captured the same atmosphere that the black and white gives it ; and so this decision was an inspired one indeed . One staple of the western genre that Jarmusch is keen to retain is the use of close-ups . The director spends a lot of time caressing Depp's facial features with his camera and , at times , even focuses on his lead actor when the action doesn't concern him . Aside from keeping in with the western tradition , this also allows Jarmusch to keep the focus on the main character , which keeps the viewer focused on his plight . For this film , Jarmusch has put together a cast of B-movie icons that will have B-movie fans foaming at the mouth . Crispin Glover , Robert Mitchum , Billy Bob Thornton , Lance Henriksen , Gabriel Byrne , John Hurt , Alfred Molina and even Iggy Pop feature and it's great to see so many faces in the same movie . The cast is , of course , lead by a man who is perhaps today's best actor ; Johnny Depp . Depp's name on a credit list speaks for itself , and I don't need to tell you that his performance is great ; nor do I need to point out the effortless cool that this movie exudes , largely thanks to the great man's presence . My only advice is see it . . . see it now .

Text2: I can't really say I'm a fan of José Mojica Marins and his Coffin Joe character - I did like his first two films , but the two I've seen since then ( The Strange World of Coffin Joe and The Awakening of the Beast ) were torrid viewings that I didn't enjoy much . To his credit , however , at least the actor / director was willing to try out different things with his character and I can give his subsequent films plaudits for that . The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe is yet another departure from the themes of the first two films ; and this time features the actor playing himself for most of it . As the film begins , director Jose Mojica Marins is being interviewed about his next film , "" The Demon Exorcist "" , and tells the press he is going to spend Christmas with friends so he can mull over what this imaginatively titled movie will be about . However , during his stay strange things start happening and the director learns that his own creation , Coffin Joe , may be at the heart of it . Plenty of actors / directors with a cult following have made self-referential films ; Lucio Fulci did it in 1990 with Cat in the Brain , recently Bruce Campbell did it with My Name is Bruce - and I'm sure many others have done it too . José Mojica Marins has always come across as a man with a high opinion of himself ; and that comes through in this movie too , with all the action focusing on the actor himself and there's even time for him to compare his character to the most famous character of Arthur Conan Doyle ! The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe is filmed in the normal Coffin Joe style - namely , cheaply , although the style certainly does benefit the film and is the most striking thing about it . The film also carries on with the completely confusing style that plagued all the four previous Coffin Joe movies and that's a bit of a problem . It is possible to simply enjoy the movie because of what you're seeing on screen ; but the film does start to get a bit boring before the credits finally roll . Overall , this is at least slightly better than the two Coffin Joe movies that went before it ; but it will only really appeal to Coffin Joe fans , and I'm not one of them .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
51,"Text1:  Parties Fines  is a truly arousing French porn in which Brigitte Lahaie plays a Baroness who , while her husband is out playing his games , is raped and used as a toy by two men who break into her estate . The tone of the film is definitely comical , still there is lots of hard core action including oral sex , anal sex , masturbation mixed with lashings of lovingly decadent atmosphere . Of all of the first-rate French XXX directors Gerard Kikoine had the best eye for the telling erotic detail . He was a fan of variation for its own sake . This guy was an excellent cameraman and seems to have shot about half the top-flight French adult films that he didn't direct . Surprisingly he also directed two horror movies "" Edge of the Sanity "" and "" Buried Alive "" . I'd like to recommend them too for my fellow fans of vintage smut .

52,"Text1: In 1993 , there was a movie called ' Twenty Bucks ' , in which the camera followed a $20 bill from one person to the next . Here's the exact same idea , done more than 60 years earlier in Germany . Considering that this is a German drama , it has a surprisingly light-hearted tone . The central object in this movie is a 10-mark banknote . I shan't try to work out a currency conversion for what 10 German marks in 1926 would equal in our own era's money , but evidently 10 marks was a respectable weekly wage for an unskilled labourer in 1926 . Young peasant girl Anna ( Mary Nolan ) has just received her first week's wages in the form of a 10-mark note . She gives it to her mother ( Agnes Mueller ) . . . who brings it to the market , intending to buy groceries . A pickpocket steals the money . And so forth . Along the way , this banknote generates more trouble than it seems to be worth . Several people die or have their lives ruined , for the sake of briefly possessing this meagre piece of currency . ( Of course , in 1926 most German filmgoers would recall the horrible inflation of only a few years earlier , when it cost a MILLION marks to buy a loaf of bread . ) The message here seems to be that money is inherently evil , that the trouble it causes far surpasses the good it can do . SPOILERS NOW . At the end of the movie , of course , the 10-mark note comes back into Anna's possession . . . and she recognises it by the serial number as the same note . Meanwhile , Anna and her young neighbour Andreas ( Werner Fuetterer ) have fallen in love . They embrace , and the banknote flutters to the floor . . . where Anna's dog tears it to shreds . Oh , the irony ! Oh , the moral ! Despite some heavy-handed visual metaphors , this is still an interesting movie with an interesting depiction of life in Germany between the World Wars . Oskar Homolka is impressive as Anna's employer . I'll rate this movie . Got change for a deutschmark ?

Text2: I saw this remarkable melodrama in October 2007 at the Cinema Muto festival in Pordenone , Italy ; they screened a print restored by Eastman House with the assistance of the Library of Congress . The 35mm print ( struck from a 28mm diacetate ) replicated the original Desmet colour tinting . Character actor Robert Warwick had a very long film and television career ; although he was an American , he was often cast as an upper-class Englishman because of his precise diction and modulated voice ( from his early training on the stage ) . I'm not aware that he ever sang on screen ; in ' The Stolen Voice ' he plays an opera singer . . . but , as this is a silent movie , we'll have to take it on faith that his singing voice is brilliant . The American adventuress Belle Borden , who is no better than she should be , is engaged to the Svengali-like Doctor Von Gahl . Gerald D'Orville ( Warwick ) is an opera star with many female fans . When Belle seduces D'Orville , Von Gahl decides to take revenge . . . on D'Orville , not on Belle . A bit of hypnotic hocus-pocus by Von Gahl , and . . . hey presto ! D'Orville is rendered mute ! The film's ending is unexpected , but quite satisfactory . Unfortunately , there are some bumps in the road before we get there . When D'Orville loses his voice , his singing career is over ( fair enough ) but this has the rather comical result of reducing him to ragged pauperdom , as if there's no other job that a healthy ( though mute ) man can obtain . And D'Orville is somehow able to journey to Europe in search of a cure , after he's been established as rendered penniless . D'Orville's friend Dick , depicted as a hopeless drunkard in the early scenes , has somehow sobered up enough to become a wealthy entrepreneur . ( What's he been drinking ? ) Already a veteran stage actor at this early date , Warwick gives a remarkable performance . Since all the actors are effectively mute in this silent movie , Warwick has a bit of difficulty establishing that his character has been stricken genuinely voiceless in a film where everyone is voiceless anyway . . . yet Warwick pulls this off , with little effort . And he skilfully conveys , in the earlier sequences , that he's an opera singer in fine ( unheard ) voice . Despite a plot that makes ' Trilby ' seem post-modern , I'll rate this movie .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
53,"Text1: People tend to use the word "" classic "" too freely . I can't help but laugh when I hear some of the movies that people call "" classics "" . The term gets thrown around so much that it often looses some of its importance and real meaning . I try to reserve "" classic "" to a select group of films that I believe have achieved a certain status and have withstood the test of time . And I have no problem putting the label "" classic "" on The Invisible Man . James Whale made a lot of great films in the 1930s . Some ( Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein , for example ) may be better known , but I've always thought of The Invisible Man as the best of the bunch . It's got everything . Terrific performances , incredible special effects , nice comedic touches , and technical brilliance are found in abundance throughout the film . - Terrific Performances : For someone who only has a few seconds of actual screen time , Claude Rains is amazing . His voice creates such a presence that at times it's easy to forget that he's not actually there . As for Una O'Connor , I've seen some people complain about Whale's use of her , but I think she was never better than in The Invisible Man . She's great whether playing the proper landlord showing a new guest to his room or as the overly hysterical woman afraid for her life . The rest of the cast , especially E . E . Clive and Gloria Stuart , is exceptional . - Incredible Special Effects : It's amazing to revisit The Invisible Man and see how well the special effects have withstood the passage of time . They were state-of-the-art in 1933 and they remain impressive today . It took some real craftsmanship to pull-off the invisibility gags seen in The Invisible Man . To me , none is more impressive than the first time we get a glimpse under the bandages while he's eating and we see no lower jaw . Impressive stuff ! - Nice Comedic Touches : Billed as a horror film , The Invisible Man actually contains more scenes of humor than horror . I've already mentioned O'Connor , but she's only a small part of the humor in the film . The police , the various frightened passersby , and even Claude Rains himself add to the fun found in The Invisible Man . I'm of the opinion that it never goes overboard , but fits nicely into the plot . - Technical Brilliance : Beyond the special effects , the film is wonderful from a technical standpoint . Lighting , cinematography , and set design are incredible and some of the best of the 30s . Everything looks perfect . In my opinion , Whale never did better . I've always been impressed by the way Whale used his camera as part of the action when many of his contemporaries seemed content with the "" plant it and shoot "" style of film-making . The only negative aspect of the film that I can possibly complain about is William Harrigan in the role of Rains ' rival , Dr . Arthur Kemp . He's just not as good as those around him . Other than that little quibble , I've got nothing to complain about . I believe it should be easy to see why I , for one , consider The Invisible Man a classic !

Text2: ( There are Spoilers ) Surviving a violent Mediterranean Sea storm the skipper , Jurgen Prochnow , was unable to save the life of his friend and fellow seaman Paul Pelikan , Mario Stock , and his former , and now Mario's , lover Mona , Gvalyna Szapolowska . The Skipper hold's himself responsible for their deaths even though he was cleared of any wrong doing by a Seaman / Mariner Court . Losing his nerve and getting drunk the Skipper hangs out all day and night , for six months , at the local Califorina Club drinking instead of going back out to sea on his ship the Bella Donna . Things change for the Skipper when he's approached by a young British duet of singer and dancer Su & Lou , Patsy Kensit & Elizabeth Hurley . The two are dying to get out of this boring ghost town of Gibraltar and sail to sunny and swinging Barbados in the West Indies . A trip of some 2 , 500 miles that would take over a month . The Skipper needing a reason to go back to sea on his ship jumps at the idea that the girls proposed to him and the next day the Skipper together with Su & Lou and their pet pooch Willard sails past the "" Pillars of Hercules "" into the wide open and dangerous Atlantic Ocean . It turned out to be a voyage straight into hell . Great scenic and ocean photography with a number of spectacular sunrise and sunsets can't overcome the film "" Kill Cruise "" unconvincing script and totally unbelievable surprise ending . The ending is so off-the-wall that it makes you wonder if you fell asleep while watching the film and missed something that would make it at least plausible to the movie's story . A less then glamorous Elizabeth Hurley and down in the dumps-looking Patsy Kensit make up the trio , or quintet if you include the cute little dog Willard , on the cruise yacht Bella Donna . Thing start to get edgy when Su becomes jealous of the Skipper taking her friend , and possibly lesbian lover , Lou away from her as they both have a sexual tryst right in front of her . Su plans to murder the Skipper , as well as Lou , by first letting them drown at sea as they were both swimming , and making out underwater , by taking off with the boat Bella Donna .

55,"Text1: The warring states of Ancient China serve as a backdrop for this pan-Asian war epic , starring the charismatic Andy Lau . Going by the literal translation of the Chinese title , it's "" Ink War "" , alluding to the fact that much of the battles in this movie relies a lot more on superior strategy in order to overcome a mammoth battle against a Goliath , with a 4 , 000 population up against the might of a 100 , 000 strong well-trained army . Based on a Japanese novel / manga Bokkou , Battle of Wits fictionalizes one of the episodes during 370BC , where China was still divided , and each nation seizing opportunities to usurp the other . Those familiar with history will know that eventually , the kingdom of Qin will ultimately unite the Middle Kingdom for the first time . However , the story sets its sights on the Kingdom of Zhao leading an attack on the smaller state of Liang . In its defence lies a mysterious man from the Mozhi tribe known as Ge Li ( Andy Lau of course ) , who galvanizes Liang's population to stage a stand against what seemingly looks like impossible odds . While war movies of long , long time ago have been flogged to death recently by Hollywood , with films like Alexander , Troy , and fantasy epics like the Lord of the Rings series , Asian movies have rarely scratched the surface until of late , with Battle of Wits leading the charge , and coming right up are at least two film adaptations of episodes from the Romance of the Three Kingdom novels . For those expecting fantastical and romanticized wu-xia martial arts moves , you will be disappointed , as this movie is rooted much in reality . Given the epic scale of this production , it still rings a sense of familiarity in its war scenes , and I thought that shooting most of them in middle-close range , loses much of its grandeur . The big spectacles shown have nothing new that will take your breath away , especially after Hollywood has plundered such productions . Nonetheless it augurs well that Battle of Wits managed to pull off a production of this nature , and has , surprise , a competent storyline to carry it through . There is a strong anti-war message that got worn on the sleeves Ge Li , as smart and cunning as he is , he's the reluctant hero , willing to make sacrifices for the greater good . He finds no pleasure in war , nor killings , but in order to save the masses , he must do what he has to thwart efforts of bloodthirsty kingdoms . He's is the message of "" loving thy enemy "" , naturally not shared by the incompetent leadership in Liang . And since time immemorial , you always have the incompetents possessing the heart of insolence , with characters of sloth and ill intentions , straddling from a high horse . Inept leaders silencing their opposition through calls of treason is a tactic all too familiar , which makes it all the more despondent as you ponder about that aged old Chinese proverb about there being nothing wrong in looking after your personal interests first , instead of bothering with the affairs of others . Ge Li faces both the task of winning over the people's trust ( since they're committing the state's defences to his organization ) , and the inevitable unappreciative , thankless task of having to do just that . As I mentioned , do not expect to see "" Qing Gong "" or fancy swordplay . Rather I was in awe with the delivery of strategies and counter strategies in having two warring factions pitting their wits against each other . Sometimes they come rather unexpectedly , and will leave you with a smile , like when you're wondering just what everyone is up to when they close their eyes en masse . Accompanied by an excellent soundtrack , the movie could be split down two halves , and while the first centered on the macro affairs , a more micro , personal affairs of the heart managed to creep in between Ge Li and Yi Yue ( the gorgeous Fan Bingbing ) , a calvary officer , and though their romance sometimes stalled the pace of the movie , it added some gravitas to Ge Li the Man , questioning his strong beliefs on being unselfish , and made the finale all the more heart-wrenching to watch . Featuring stars like Wu Ma and Nicky Wu ( when was the last time I saw them in a movie ) and Korean actor Ahn Sung-kee , this certainly is the movie to watch this week . Forget about them animated penguins , treat yourself to an epic worthy of your time , and well worth a weekend ticket .

56,"Text1: ' The She-Wolf ' would be totally implausible if it were not inspired by a real person . Hetty Green ( 1834-1916 ) was a miser financier who inherited $7 . 5 million from her Quaker father . Investing this in Civil War bonds and then in railway shares , she was worth at least $100 million when she dropped dead while haggling over the price of a bottle of milk . All of her wealth was built through her own business acumen , rather than passive investment . Her miserliness surpassed anything in Dickens . This millionairess once spent an entire night searching for a lost 2-cent stamp . She lived in the cheapest possible rooming-house , never used heat nor hot water , never washed , ate the cheapest possible food . She owned precisely one dress ( black , of course ) and only one set of undergarments , wearing these clothes until they wore out before she purchased others . When her son injured his leg , Hetty Green took him out of hospital ( she was too mean to pay the medical bill ) and tried to find a free clinic that would admit him as a charity case ; eventually , the boy's leg became gangrenous and had to be amputated . Even then , Green haggled over the price of a prosthetic limb ! When her peg-legged son reached adulthood , Green sent him hundreds of miles to deliver some valuable bearer bonds for her ; when he reached his destination , the bond certificates turned out to be fake . ( Green was testing her son's honesty . ) In ' She-Wolf ' , actress May Robson gives a standout performance as Hattie Breen , a character clearly based on Hetty Green . Hattie is the millionaire widow of a financier who spent his life competing with rival magnate William Remington . Although not quite a miser in Hetty Green's league , Hattie Breen is a right piece of work . For 15 years , she has been ' investing ' the wages of her housemaid Maria ; now , when Maria demands an accounting , Hattie claims to know nothing about it . She sacks her stenographer David Talbot , after exploiting him . Hattie's son Tom works for her , but she exploits him ruthlessly and she is hostile to Tom's pregnant wife Peggy . Hattie's daughter ( annoyingly named ' Faire ' ) is also exploited and harassed . Eventually , Remington offers Tom millions of dollars to come work for Remington's interests . . . but this will require Tom to betray the business secrets of his mother , who has done everything conceivable to ruin his life , his health and his marriage . ( Sounds like a no-brainer to me . ) This movie is Robson's all the way . An extremely talented actress who spent most of her career in obscurity , but who was fortunate enough to reach near-stardom in lead roles at an advanced age , Robson displays a wide range of emotions here in a role that could easily have toppled into melodramatics . The script gives Robson several long speeches : the movie stalls at these points , but Robson's characterisation is excellent . SPOILERS COMING . After going to such lengths to establish Hattie Breen as an utterly ruthless businesswoman who cares about nothing but profits ( and controlling other people ) , the movie then does a volte-face and reveals that , deep down , Hattie has really got ( all together now ) a heart of gold . Astonishingly , her son and her former secretary both decide to remain loyal to Hattie : this is barely plausible for the son , but not remotely plausible for the secretary . Hattie comes through for the cheated housemaid Maria . The last scene is extremely annoying , as it requires Hattie to set up a highly contrived situation merely to pull a pointless ' joke ' on her son . Hattie tells Tom that his wife Peggy is intimately entertaining the president of the Mohawk Central Railroad . It turns out that Peggy is nursing her infant son . . . whom Hattie has just appointed to the presidency of a railway she owns ! ( Must be an interesting stockholders ' meeting . ) ' The She-Wolf ' is a bizarre film . Significantly , the least plausible portions of this film are the fictional inventions and contrivances , while the most plausible portions are the scenes in which Hattie Breen's behaviour emulates that of the actual Hetty Green . I'm astonished that nobody has yet made a film about the real Hetty Green , whose true story is far more fascinating than anything in ' The She-Wolf ' . I'll rate this Hollywood concoction .

Text2: While most of the Tweety-Sylvester cartoons have Tweety brutally inflict pain on Sylvester or see the putty tat attacked by Hector the bulldog , "" Greedy for Tweety "" throws a wrench in the works by having all three get injured at once . When the trio runs into a busy street and each member ends up with a broken leg - does minuscule little Tweety have enough of a leg to actually get broken ? - they get taken to the hospital with Granny as the nurse . Sure enough , Sylvester is still fixated on devouring Tweety ( even if it means abusing Hector ) , while Hector is intent on protecting the little guy ( even if it means abusing Sylvester ) . Many years ago , I saw this cartoon as part of the compilation film "" Daffy Duck's Movie : Fantastic Island "" . But I'd forgotten some of the coolest scenes ( namely the X-ray and the hammer-wielding mouse ) . As for the idea of Sylvester and Hector fanatically continuing their battle while Tweety sensibly tries to get some rest , maybe that's an allusion to the Cold War : the two superpowers sought to destroy each other while smaller , humbler countries tried to settle down . You know what they say : when all you have is a hammer , everything looks like a nail . OK , so I probably went a little far in trying to analyze this cartoon .

That's what I encountered trying to watch this as Paul Muni , as a Polish coal mine worker , speaks in such a heavy accent I couldn't decipher what he was saying . It gets to be a frustrating experience . If this would come out on DVD with English subtitles , I'd be glad to give it another look . Muni , almost always a fascinating actor , plays good-guy Joe Radek , a Pennsylvania coal miner who is used by his bosses to help them break the union .

I always laugh at how these billionaire film makers always try to make management or the rich guys the evil ones . Maybe it's a guilty conscience from all the money they have made , but I see them more as big hypocrites . However , I find no fault in any movie trying to help the coal miners who did , in fact , had it bad and deserved better . It was dirty job and a dangerous one . It still is , as far as I know , but conditions have to be a whole lot better than a hundred years ago so don't misinterpret what I said earlier : in many cases , management was "" the bad guy "" way back then .

Text2: As a lifetime soap opera fan , I have watched a lot of soaps and most can't compare to the best soap on television . Screw the Emmys for not naming it the Best Daytime Drama of the year . Since it's debut in 1973 , The Young and the Restless revolutionized daytime by the master , William J . Bell and his wife Lee Phillip Bell . Together they created the Young and the Restless and Bold and the Beautiful , both the most watched soaps on daytime today . What's their secret ? They don't kill characters and return them back from the dead , rather they don't kill many characters . They stick to the old fashioned way of storytelling . They don't do things quickly which is why is may not be for everybody . What is their strength is the excellent cast of actors and crew members who don't just stay 3 years and leave . THey stay a lot longer and there are exceptions . I think they stay because the work is good and in Los ANgeles , you can do other things like film and television and even theater . Yes , the cast includes Jeanne Cooper , Eric Braeden , Peter Bergman , Melody Thomas Scott , Kate Linder , and so many others who have come and gone . It's not for everybody , it might be too slow for some people but the stories are good and somewhat crazy sometimes but worth watching . At least , they make an effort to focus on the older characters like Katherine and Jill , archenemies , friends , and rivals and even related . The show gets stronger in time . With head writer , Kay Alden in charge , things have not changed so much since the Beloved William J . Bell passed away a year ago . he was a legendary creative person entirely . He and Lee treat the cast and crew like their family which is why so many have stayed so long . Bill and Lee were a dynamic team together on screen and off-screen as well . I wished the Kennedy Center Honors would have honored him for his contributions to daytime television which are just incredible . He helped create daytime .

59,"Text1: The first movie I watched starring enigmatic Chinese actor Jiang Wen was during a business trip to KL , catching a show at KLCC before my late afternoon flight . In Warriors of Heaven and Earth , he donned a moustache and beard as the charismatic leader Lieutenant Li , in a movie which had great premise but a lousy story to tell . As for Zhao Wei , unless your head was buried in sand , you wouldn't have missed the era in the late 90s where she was bombarding television sets everywhere in her role as Little Sparrow in My Fair Princess Huan Zhu Ge Ge . So I guess putting them together in a movie made it almost irresistible to not want to pick up this DVD . This was actually a precursor to their Warriors movie where they collaborated again , but in this modern setting , based upon a short story "" Adiliya by the River "" ( what the heck is Adiliya ? ) by Jin Renshun , they star as a pair of wannabe lovers looking into exploring if they could be together . Sweeping aside the age gap , this movie is one heck of a mindgame . It's frustrating at times as nothing actually happens , and the lead characters just sit around and talk about stuff absolutely not related to anything at all . Well , at least not directly related to what's happening on hand , but telling stories - we're sitting through a story with characters telling stories , fictional ones which doesn't really add depth to plot , or characterization . It's pretty strange stuff . And strange are their characters too , with the only realistic moment is the beginning - if you're looking for a stranger in a cafe , and there are two ladies , who would you approach first , the hot one , or the plain looking one ? Chen Mingliang ( Jiang Wen ) went for the jugular , but it was actually Wu Fang ( Zhao Wei ) who was his blind date . They don't start off well , and continued to bicker . One's become obsessive with her conservatism , while the latter is a serial blind-dater . But there is more than meets the eye to Wu Fang , and herein lies the guesswork to decipher who she actually was , and the motivations behind what she is doing . You can boil it down to PMS , or to the wall being built around her heart , or to just plain old psychosis . Whatever the case is , it's about persistence and the relentless pursuit of who you like , and on the other side , to spice things up with playing coy , hard to get , and being more of a mysterious enigma . Nothing much to take away in less than 90 minutes , except to admire the two lead's ability to act and play off each other , and Christopher Doyle's cinematography ( he makes tea leaves in hot water so sexy ) , which is a bit of a waste in a movie lacking in strength of story . I hate to say this , but the repetitive score is a bit irritating . Code 9 DVD contains zero extras . The sound was quite bad , with plenty of echo , like speaking in a vast enclosed space .

60,"Text1: Neil Jordan is a graduate of the Ken Loach I-Hate-England school of film-making which means that like Loach he spurns no opportunity to explore its worst aspects in loving detail . This time around it's the sex industry that sleazes its way into his spotlight . The story is improbable-to-ridiculous , one leave it out , guv , after another . Why , for example does Michael Caine's Mr Big wait til Bob Hoskins gets out of the slammer before hiring a driver for Cathy Tyson's hooker - what did she do before , take a bus ? In turn why does Tyson wait until their initial antipathy has thawed before asking him to locate another hooker when 1 ) surely the world of London hookers is not that large , there's obviously some kind of network whereby one can locate another without charming a violent oak into doing the job and 2 ) for what she spent kitting out Hoskins with shirts , suit and topcoat in a trendy Men's Store she could have hired a private detective for a month but given how easy the hooker was to find he'd have taken about a day and a half tops . This leaves us with the acting ; for Hoskins it's the mixture as before , all contained violence and effing and blinding , sure he was phoning it in by that stage , Robbie Coltrane is totally unconvincing and Mike Tyson could have done as well as Cathy . Okay , it's twenty years old - a freebie with a newspaper , just as well I didn't spend more than the price of a paper I buy anyway on this pap - and maybe at the time it looked better but it's way past its sell-by date .

Surprisingly he had turned out some twenty-some films already and this was hot on the heels of The Spy In Black . Produced in 1939 and released two months after War broke out this is , inevitably , a bit of a flag-waver and does indeed at one point take a proper gander at goose-stepping Nazis . Clearly Ralph Richardson and Merle Oberon were there just for their marquee value given that the film is virtually all documentary . As the first British film completed and released in wartime it will always have a curiosity value and it does capture a Utopian England that the Blairites have all but destroyed .

61,"Text1: This is a Harry Langdon short film made for Mack Sennett and is included with the "" Harry Langdon : Lost and Found "" four DVD set . Harry's father and brothers are manly and rugged types , so they have little regard for the rather effeminate Harry who would rather make a living playing the bass violin . In fact , the dad throws Harry out , as he feels he's an embarrassment . The problem is that Harry is horrible and his chances of being a professional musician seem nil . After many failed attempts , Harry finally finds his niche and returns home a rich hero at the end of the film . The joke ideas in this film are pretty good , though I don't want to ruin it by describing them . However , there aren't that many laughs and the film just seemed a bit on the mediocre side . Not bad - - just not all that memorable or comedic .

Text2: There is no way that I think this movie could have been done just a year or two before , as Hollywood had very mixed opinions about the Nazi menace . Many moguls just hoped the war in Europe would just blow over and few films really addressed the true Nazi menace until the US actually entered the war . However , one of the brave films to address it honestly and pre-December 1941 was Moral Storm . I commend it for both being willing to take a stand against repression AND for giving a fairly propaganda-free message . In other words , although the Nazis are portrayed as bad , they are not nearly as comical and over-the-top as they were often portrayed in later films . On top of the message , the acting is as good as it gets . Stewart , Sullavan , Morgan and the rest at their best . In particular , I find myself about to cry when Ms . Sullavan cried - - she was THAT good . Also , in a bit of unusual casting , Robert Young ( you probably know his from FATHER KNOWS BEST or MARCUS WELBY ) played a Nazi . This was actually a great choice , as in most of his prior movies he'd cultivated a "" nice guy "" image - - what better way to show the insidiousness of evil by having seemingly good people join them . For Frank Morgan , this was probably his best performance of his career . Perfect acting all around . While not one of the very greatest films ever made , it certainly stands out as perhaps the best of 1940 . This is also very , very sad as the apparently cowardly ( what other explanation could there be ? ) Academy didn't nominate the film for a single award ! ! !","{""output"": ""YES""}"
62,"Text1: Dolores Claiborne is a very solid adaptation of a book by a man who is probably the king of modern horror literature : Stephen King ( I haven't read that many books , so I can't say for sure ) . I haven't read the original source material , but judging by this film it is safe to say that it wasn't meant to be horror-per say , as the film follows more of a psychological thriller pattern when it comes to plotting ; despite some blatant horror influences . The style of plotting is relatively exciting , and it shows both the current events , which it then intertwines with flashbacks of the past . This sort of film can easily get muddled , but you have to give credit to Dolores Claiborne as it successfully manages to keep itself on the straight and narrow with regards to plotting . The film follows the story of a housekeeper who has allegedly murdered her employer by throwing her down the stairs . The plot thickens when her daughter , who still blames her mother for the mysterious death of her father , comes to town to see what's going on with her parent . Kathy Bates , who impressed in the 1990 Stephen King adaptation of ' Misery ' , overacts here , it has to be said , but in spite of that she still brings believability and a relative degree of sympathy to her character , and it's very easy to see why director Taylor Hackford would have cast her in the title role . She is joined on screen by a woman who is one of today's most underrated performers ; Jennifer Jason Leigh . Leigh impresses throughout the film and although her character is definitely second to Bates ' in the film's hierarchy , Leigh still delivers the best performance in the movie . While the film is always good enough to be called interesting , it is overlong and had the action have been compacted , the resulting movie would have been far more thrilling and as it is a thrillers ' main aim to be thrilling ; shortening the movie down would definitely have been a good idea . While this movie isn't exactly a fine example of the genre , it's a solid thriller and if you find yourself with nothing better to do one night while this film is on television ; you could do a lot worse than watch it .

Text2: This lovely Hammer Horror blending of the traditional vampire tale with martial arts stars Peter Cushing as Professor Van Helsing . The plot follows Van Helsing , who is drawn into a plot involving a legendary seven golden vampires , the prince of darkness ; Dracula himself , the undead and a load of martial artists . Our hero must , along with his son and an escort of kung fu fighters travel to a cursed village somewhere in China to rid it of the vampire curse that holds it . One of the reasons why Hammer horror is so brilliant is that it isn't afraid to make a film that most other film studios would regard as stupid and then make it work . The main reason why Hammer horror does work is that the films , despite showing many macabre images , are always good natured and made with a lot of heart so they're easy to like ; and this one is no different . The Eastern style makes for a very different vampire film to what we're used to , and Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires seems keen to capitalise on that as it changes many of the traditional vampire rules to suit the east ( for example , the traditional cross to ward off vampires is replaced by the image of Budha ) . As usual with Hammer , the effects are hokey to say the least , the production values are low and everyone except Peter Cushing leaves a lot to be desired acting-wise . . . but without these traits , this film wouldn't be Hammer , so these things are not only forgivable , but welcome . Peter Cushing's performance in this movie isn't his best , but fans of his will still relish it . There's something about Cushing's persona that makes him very watchable , and every film with him in it is worth watching , if only for that reason . He also gets involved in some of the martial arts fights , which is nice to see . The fights themselves are very well staged , much better than I was expecting with this being a horror film with kung fu elements , rather than a full blown fight-fest . This is the fifth film I've seen by Hammer director Roy Ward Baker and although it's not the best , it's still a very solid offering from the man who was probably Hammer's finest director . This film is a lot of fun , and I don't doubt that it will delight anyone who sees it , and therefore it comes with the highest recommendations from me .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

64,"Text1: This film is sometimes consigned to Ford's later , increasingly exhausted period , but if it had been made by an unknown it would have been applauded as a stunning directorial debut . It has its flaws , as all movies must , but it's a seamless blend of drama , romance , action , and comedy - - and it's a good example of Ford's major strength , the ability to show you mounted figures strung out across the skyline and then tell you a personal story about some of the individuals in that horde . It's both epic and detailed . Ford began directing in the early 1920s , mostly silent Westerns . A handful of cowboys would ride in one direction while Ford shot the scene . Then he'd tell them to ride back in the other direction and shoot that . Many of the scripts were built around stories that could be described in only a few sentences , and the rest improvised on the spot . In one film he used only members of his family . And he built up a stock company that worked in one after another of his later works , often until they died . ( See Hoot Gibson here as a cavalry corporal . ) By the time "" The Horse Soldiers "" was in preparation , of course , times had changed considerably . The contract weighed several pounds and ran to almost 800 pages . If the strain of location shooting , of directing in general , hadn't been enough to tire him out , the administrative and financial responsibilities might have done the job . He had little patience for these demands . And on top of that , one of the older members of his company , a stunt man and personal friend , broke his neck doing a saddle fall , after which Ford lost much of his interest in the film . It shows in the editing and in the climactic scene that was cut short . But if the 63-year-old Ford was flagging , it's still a good movie packed with interest even for people who never heard of John Ford . For one thing , a lot of money is on display , and is well used . For another there are the performances of the two male leads , who both turn in good performances . Constance Towers , alas , is an attractive woman but an unconvincing actress . ( She looks better ungroomed , wrapped in a wet blanket with stringy damp hair , than she does all glossed up with lipstick and modern makeup . ) The dialog may fail from time to time . As Wayne says of his earlier transaction with doctors who mistakenly operated on his wife and caused her death , "" I didn't kill either one of them . . . . Maybe I was too conventional . "" But for every stumble there is a leap . Two enlisted men have been assigned to keep an eye on captive Constance Towers . She complains about her "" constant companions "" to Colonel John Wayne , who calls the pair over to chew them out . The two men feel unjustly accused and one says to Wayne , "" Yew told us it was awright as long as we could see the top of her haid ! "" Towers listens aghast and slaps Wayne's face . ( It's pretty funny . ) No point in going on too much about incidents , comic or dramatic or romantic . One's interest in the narrative never wanes . We really want to find out what happened . ( Anyone who wants to find out what REALLY happened can find a book about the actual Greerson's raid and its translation into film , easily available on Amazon . com . The attack of the little-boy soldiers from VMI wasn't so funny . ) See it if you can . There's something in it for all interests .

Text2: This is an exceptionally manic and entertaining early Woody Woodpecker short , where the voices were done by Mel Blanc . Because I want to discuss some details , this is a spoiler warning : This short has a fairly basic plot-Woody is driving along and comes up on a motorcycle cop hiding and watching for "" SPEEEEEDERS ! "" . The voice will be familiar to anyone who has watched a few shorts from Warner Brothers , as Mel Blanc used the same voice for a giant in a Bugs Bunny short and one very similar for other rather dense characters . Woody being Woody , he has to mess with the poor cop . There's a speeding gag early on where Woody and his car become a colorful blur with no distinctive outline . The cop and Woody go back and forth about his speeding , with each one making a different and distinctive noise to represent speeding . Most of the rest of the cartoon is spent with the cop trying to catch Woody and the antics of our feathered lunatic in avoiding capture . Ultimately , the poor cop has a nervous breakdown and is hospitalized , where Woody renews his acquaintance with the unfortunate man and reminds him who he is by making his speeding noise once again . This short is available on one of the DVDs released by Columbia House , under an alternate title , Woody's Jalopy . It's well worth seeing . Recommended .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: One of the films to result from the ' Project Greenlight ' TV series , this frenetic movie tells us the slim but entertaining story of a siege laid by some truly hideous creatures to the patrons and employees of a middle-of-nowhere Southern bar . Although the action set pieces are edited so choppily as to make them incoherent , there's no denying the zeal that the debuting director , John Gulager , and his crew , bring to the project . The movie is full of some great gore , and has some pretty good creature creations . I also found it interesting the way that it kept playing with expectations in terms of who lives and who dies . Unpredictability , more often than not , is a good thing , and I appreciated this movie for that . The cast is game . I found Henry Rollins particularly funny as a motivational speaker ( the movie takes the time to cleverly mock those in this kind of profession ) , and the presence of the directors ' father , veteran actor Clu Gulager , as the bartender , is a special treat . The characters are introduced at the beginning of the movie with quick freeze frames and accompanying information , including life expectancy .

Text2: Perhaps "" Ghost Town "" isn't one of the best horror movies of the 80's , but at least you'll have to admit the concept is refreshing , courageous , original and semi-successful . This one of the very few horror / western hybrids ever made and particularly the accomplished atmosphere is praiseworthy . "" Ghost Town "" maintains an unsettling and ominous ambiance throughout , and I have to confess that was certainly the last thing I expected to find in a Charles Band production . The basic plot and conceptual ideas ( thought up by David Schmoeller of "" Tourist Trap "" and "" Puppet Master "" ) are reasonably ingenious as well , but the script is sadly very incoherent and occasionally even forgets to make the slightest bit of sense . "" Ghost Town "" opens with the mysterious disappearance of a young woman who literally gets sucked into a time-tornado after being deviated from the main roads and chased by an invisible horseman . The young and straight-shooting deputy Langley follows her trail and ends up in a forsaken and seemingly cursed ghost town in another era . The town's dominated by an immortal and sadistic outlaw named Devlin , and he also kidnapped the young woman ( for reasons still unknown to me ) and keeps the cursed villagers under a siege of terror . "" Ghost Town "" often feels incomplete , as if several extended parts of the screenplay were left out . Many things remain unexplained , but you strongly feel that - somewhere in the original script - there must have been perfectly reasonable answers to all questions ; only the ended up on the cutting floor instead of in the film . There's the aforementioned WHY regarding the kidnapping of the girl , but also the background of Devlin's character remains too vague . Still , if you manage to overlook the few shortcomings in the script , you'll reckon that "" Ghost Town "" is actually scarier than most contemporary horror movies , and this even without the use of gory make-up effects or many gruesome killings . This movie has other trumps for generating suspense , like the sublime choice of locations , uncanny music and creepy characterizations . Devlin is a fascinating villain and Jimmie Skaggs did a tremendous job playing him . He looks menacing , talks nasty and just loves raising hell wherever he goes . I really enjoyed those copious times where he stood in the saloon or out in the streets , spotted the deputy and shouted out "" Lawman ! ! "" Other supportive characters are pretty cool & creepy too , like The Dealer and the blacksmith .

The biggest liar in the Marine Corps claims to be a musical genius , but his buddies get mighty sore when a piano is delivered to their South Seas island base and the fellow says ' I WON'T PLAY . ' Propelled by the wise guy personality of Dane Clark and the loveliness of Janice Paige ( who gets to sing ' Body and Soul ' ) , here is an enjoyable , lighthearted little film which still should entertain viewers today . This is the type of fast-moving escapist fare that was so valued by weary movie audiences as World War Two dragged into its sixth year . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . This particular film was the winner of the Academy Award for the Best 2-Reel Live Action Short for 1944 .

Text2: With the country in the throes of the Great Depression , the President calls upon a celebrated Broadway impresario to become the first Secretary of Amusement , in the hopes that Americans can beat hard times by learning to smile , laugh , and , eventually , STAND UP AND CHEER ! It is always vital when examining old films to try to be sensitive to their context within their own time frames . Important movies of 70 years ago may look terribly trite now through absolutely no fault of their own . Judging by today's standards can often lead to pitfalls . That having been stated , however , it is difficult to appreciate this film without seeing it for what it is : undeniably silly . And racist . And even a bit bizarre at times . But it contains one great jewel . . . Earnest Warner Baxter & lovely Madge Evans certainly give the plot a try , but the script is dead set against them all the way , making him encourage hillbilly singers as the remedy for the nation's economic woes and having her mope about lovelorn & lonely . As Aunt Jemima , blackfaced singer Tess Gardella ( very popular at the time on Broadway's Show Boat ) and especially Stepin Fetchit are embarrassingly stereotyped . It should be noted , however , that this sort of racial belittlement was not unusual in the Hollywood of the 1930's . The physical , knockdown humor of Frank Mitchell & Jack Durant , playing a couple of zany U . S . Senators , is very odd & no longer funny . Odder still is the penguin that thinks he's Jimmy Durante . Familiar faces show up from time to time - Nigel Bruce , Ralph Morgan , little Our Gang kid Scotty Beckett , warbling John Boles - but they are quickly submerged by the plot . In the midst of all this clutter of mismatched parts , when all might be given up for lost , comes five-year-old Shirley Temple and she is an utter joy . Shirley had already appeared in a series of features & shorts . But it was here , singing & dancing - and completely obliterating poor James Dunn who played her father - that the situation was ripe for her to march straight into the nation's heart . In 1935 Shirley would begin to star in her string of classic family films , and , with the death of Marie Dressler in July of 1934 , the mighty moppet was to begin her reign as Hollywood's number one box office attraction .

70,"Text1: Robert Donat is one of my favorite actors of the 1930s to 1950s . Despite a relatively small film output ( roughly 25 movies I believe ) Donat showed a wide variety of different parts , including comedy , historical , character studies , spy films ( including THE 39 STEPS for Hitchcock ) , and straight drama . He never gave a bad performance even if the film left some problems . And all was accomplished despite being a serious asthmatic . To top it off , he pulled off the all time miracle "" Oscar "" for best actor . He beat Clarke Gable in 1939 , when Gable's "" Rhett Butler "" was the odds favorite for best role . Donat trumped it with the schoolmaster , "" Mr . Chipping "" , in GOODBYE MR . CHIPS . Fans of GONE WITH THE WIND may have cause to grumble ( forgetting Gable already won the Oscar as "" Peter Warne "" in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT ) but fans of Donat ( and they included Walter Matthau , who said he was his favorite actor ) have never complained . SABOTAGE AGENT is known in the U . S . as THE ADVENTURES OF TARTU . The title change is understandable . There are so many films with "" sabotage "" in the title ( Hitchcock had "" SABOTAGE "" in 1936 and "" SABOTEUR "" in 1943 ) . But the name is misleading accidentally . "" Jan Tartu "" is the false identity name given to Donat's character Captain Terence Stevenson when he is sent on a mission into Czechoslovakia during World War II . The ADVENTURES OF STEVENSON would have been less misleading on this point , but people might have thought that it referred to the author of TREASURE ISLAND . Stevenson , a linguist , has been on home watch duty , but is selected for the mission due to his grasp on central European languages , specifically , Czech , Roumanian , and German ( a neat trick , by the way , as these are from three separate language groups : Slavic , Latin , and Germanic - Stevenson must have been like my father , a real super expert on foreign tongues ) . The real Tartu ( who has conveniently been killed ) was a member of Roumania's native Fascist group , "" The Iron Guard "" . The Roumanians joined the Axis in 1941 , having seen what happened to the most pro-Western Balkan state ( Yugoslavia ) which was invaded and bombed ( as was Greece ) . Roumania and Bulgaria ( the latter reluctantly ) joined the Nazis ( Roumania did it willingly in expectation of expanding its borders , Bulgaria to protect itself from the Russians under Stalin ) . It's instructive to follow what happened in both countries . From the King on down in Bulgaria there was a general refusal to cooperate in sending Jews to their deaths in German camps , so that 90 % of Bulgaria's Jews ( the largest number of ANY country in Europe ) survived World War II . Roumania handed the bulk of them over . Donat goes to Prague as Tartu , and plays him as a flamboyant nitwit . The Nazis have little real use for him in Prague ( he is there on some trivial diplomatic excuse ) and find him more of a nuisance than anything else . Donat decides to allow the Nazis to find just useless he is - in one sequence he manages to insist on "" helping "" them capture an anti-Nazi partisan . Of course the partisan escapes while the Nazis are forced to see "" Tartu "" pounding on a wall as though he is doing something remarkably clever . The mission is to find the secret factory where a deadly new gas is being manufactured ( this is a running theme in many films of the 1930s and 1940s - a secret poison gas that some country is manufacturing to use on the battlefield : memories of the battles of World War I prevented people from considering poison gas used on civilian prisoners for "" ethnic cleansing "" purposes ) . With the assistance of Glynis Johns and Valerie Hobson Donat does find the factory , cleverly hidden within a mountain . Now the problem is to destroy it , which leads to an exciting conclusion within the factory within the mountain . Unusual for most Donat films ( only KNIGHT WITHOUT ARMOUR has as much daring-do involving Donat and co-star Marlene Dietrich fleeing the Bolsheviks in 1919 ) THE ADVENTURES OF TARTU is a good escapist film . Although the references in it put it firmly in 1943 when it was made it is still an entertaining film for today . The performances are good , with Johns quite moving as she sacrifices herself for Donat's mission , and Hobson being forced to descend to murder to help as well . I recommend it for those performances , as well as Donat's over-the-top one as the eccentric "" Iron Guardist "" .

What happened here is that elements of the rivalry between Russia and England in India and central Asia , as well as one incident ( a notorious one ) from the later Sepoy Revolt , are combined here - and the clash of military personalities in the charge are sacrificed to the story . Flynn and the other British officers are located in India in 1853 , and find that Gordon has turned enemy because the British Government stopped paying him a bribe . Gordon is based on Nana Sahib , a leading Sepoy rebel , who had nothing really to do with the Crimean War . But in the film , now getting bribes from Russia ( represented by Barratt ) , Nana Sahib leads an attack on a fort at Chikuti which ends with a general massacre of English men , women , and children when they were evacuating under a flag of truce . This is based on the massacre of the British at Cawnpore in 1857 - an incident that was one of the great atrocities of that period . Nana Sahib never was punished for it ( he fled to the Himilayas to avoid capture , and died about 1870 ) . Jules Verne would later use this atrocity ( and Nana Sahib ) in his 1881 novel THE STEAM HOUSE ( made up of two novels , THE DEMON OF CAWNPORE and TIGERS AND TRAITORS ) . Among the dead are relatives and loved ones of the soldiers in Flynn's brigade of cavalry , including his brother Knowles . He and his fellow soldiers pledge revenge , but Gordon is hiding in Russia . Then comes the Crimean War . Now the Crimean War , one of the stupidest that four major powers ( England , Russia , Turkey , and France ) ever blundered into dealt with who had the rights to be protector of Christian shrines in the Holy Land against "" infidel "" ( i . e . Mohammedan - Ottoman Empire ) control . Russia claimed this , but was suspected ( probably rightly ) of wanting a pretext to gain control of the Black Sea and the Bosphorus . None of this is in the Flynn film ( why should it be - it's not dealing with India but Palestine and the Dardenelles ) . The conclusion is the charge - here caused when Flynn realizes there is a chance to get Gordon when he learns he is with Barratt and the Russian forces ( one wonders why - he is of no use in the Crimea ! ) . His commander in chief , Stephenson gives him an order for Bruce to take the Light Brigade to a position in a valley at Balaclava . Flynn ( on his own ) rewrites the order . They are now to charge the Russian guns . This is what they do , and in the process most of the Brigades heroes die , but Flynn ( before he dies ) gets Gordon ( who while dying is speared by the other surviving Light Brigade members ) . Barratt also is killed . At the end Stephenson reads a last note from Flynn explaining what he did and why . He keeps quiet about it , and lets the world condemn him for the "" magnificent blunder "" . Only his friend , E . E . Clive , realizes what Stephenson is doing . Would that it was so simple , but the incompetence shown by the British high command was responsible for the disaster , not a hot blooded young fool's desire to right a tragic wrong . But the film is so well done - in a period when America simply honored the British Empire when not being self-congratulatory to itself in it's history films - that it remains quite entertaining . Flynn plays the brave heart who disobeys orders for honor and righteous vengeance quite well . Gordon plays the Indian as the "" foreign devil "" quite well . Aside from the film's mock grandeur and mock history , it is significant as the first film that Flynn made with his pal David Niven , and for more than that infamous "" Bring on the Empty Horses "" crack of Michael Curtiz . It was in this film that Flynn had the experience of falling on his behind when an extra riding behind his horse purposely "" goosed "" Flynn's horse with his lance . Flynn ( considered erroneously a pushover glamor boy by the extras ) beat up the guilty party and won the respect of the other extras from then on .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

This went out of production and was pulled from shelves in January of 2004 , so it may occupy a bit of your time to find it for sale .

Text2: This is another all-star film I'd long wanted to watch ? with the added attraction of a Hollywood / Oscar backdrop ? but which ultimately proved a disappointment ? so that it's small wonder it seems to have fallen through the cracks over the years ( in fact , I have had to make do with a panned-and-scanned copy culled from VHS ) ! The film is glossy ( itself earning Oscar nominations in two categories i . e . art direction / set decoration and costume design ) , undeniably interesting ( though hardly reaping its full potential given the narrative's regrettable emphasis on characters ' private lives rather than the business side of things ) and with entertainingly high-pitched performances ( especially star Stephen Boyd ) and dialogue . As such , it's extremely typical of the cynical era from which it emanates ( another similar title is Robert Aldrich's equally hard-to-find THE LEGEND OF LYLAH CLARE [ 1968 ] ) ? but the fact that it deals with matters that the people involved should be familiar with doesn't prevent a veneer of artifice throughout , not to mention a tendency towards cliché ? though , to be fair , the similar but vastly superior THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL ( 1952 ) paints an equally melodramatic picture of Hollywood ! Boyd plays an aspiring actor who tramples over everybody , especially those closest to him ( Tony Bennett , Jill St . John , Eleanor Parker , Elke Sommer and Milton Berle ) in order to achieve his goal and stay at the top .

77,"Text1: Warner Bros . occasionally gave ERROL FLYNN a break away from his usual swashbuckling roles but should have paid more attention to finding a better source material . The Lloyd C . Douglas novel is an uneven mixture of religion , psychiatry and sudsy melodramatics , never quite sure what the net results ought to be . Flynn is not the problem . He turns in a fine performance as a doctor who nobly sacrifices his own reputation when a medical mistake made by an older doctor could ruin the man's life . He looks as handsome and fit as ever . If this were made in the ' 50s or ' 60s , no doubt Ross Hunter would have persuaded Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson to have a go at it , as they did in Douglas ' THE MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION , another story about a doctor who pays for his mistake , all done up in glossy technicolor . But it soon becomes clear that this is a weak tale , full of platitudes and moralizing by a preacher ( Sir Cedric Hardwicke ) who neatly sums up his philosophy of right and wrong with simplistic slogans . The message is poured on pretty thick before the story reaches the point where Flynn takes a medical risk in order to prove his theory about spotted fever . It's all very obvious , slick and artificial , but at least the performances are earnest . Anita Louise and Margaret Lindsay can't do too much with the pallid female leads but Walter Abel does nicely as a dedicated physician and Henry O'Neill is believable as the medical man who makes a serious error during a critical operation . Frank Borzage directs the proceedings with dignity but gets little help from a stagnant script . Max Steiner contributes one of his lesser scores , more subdued than usual in providing any melodic themes . Interesting only in the fact that it provides Flynn with an offbeat role as a physician .

80,"Text1: Alfred Hitchcock's the Lodger finds the master of suspense , at 27 , already with an instant knack at mounting suspense and dread , often with some startling camera movements , not to mention the moments of gallows humor . It's exhilarating to see Hitchcock , in a silent film no less , stage the implied murder of a woman by showing movement , shadow , a pause , then a seemingly over-the-top close-up of the woman screaming , then cutting to the next day or whatever . He makes a street corner look downright vicious and creepy , and I'm sure in the intended blue-tinted scenes it's something of a minor revelation on escalating the thriller of the period into art ( the version available on the most recent DVD , as an ' extra ' on the DVD of Sabotage , is acceptable at best and at worst is a travesty for collectors who might want the best musical score or digital treatment of a transfer ) . It's the classic story of Jack the Ripper , with certain names changed and a slight twist of a jealous romantic plot common to Hitchcock films - here he's called the "" Avenger - and it concerns a certain lodger who goes to stay for a bit at a house owned by Mr . and Mrs . Bunting . The lodger is a funny sort of chap , hating the pictures on the wall in his room , saying ominous throwaway words during a chess game , and going out in foggy London at night . The Bunting's daughter likes him , but her fiancée , a detective , is jealous and suspects the lodger to be the deadly Avenger , out killing blonds left and right . The story , despite seeming ( at least on the DVD ) to jump around a little bit in mid-scene , is executed with a level of narrative fluidity I was surprised by . Sometimes in silent films one gets so attracted to just the visual aspects of certain compositions or the star power of the leads that the story loses its way . Here Hitchcock balances the elements , and makes for some good details along the way . There are little things that stand out as interesting techniques or little notes in the storyline . I liked the editing style when we see a crowd gather around the corpse of one of the Avenger . I liked , a lot , seeing a figure walk across what seems like a staircase , but looking upward at him . And I loved seeing a little note of romance , as a character cuts out a little heart-shaped piece of dough and hands it to Daisy ( played by , simply named , ' June ' who is a beauty ) , coaxingly , but then when not accepted right away he rips it in two . A detail like that , or a line of dialog at the end cuing the audience to something "" you're toothbrush - you left it behind "" makes for a nice touch too . It doesn't hurt either that Ivor Novello makes for a perfectly ambiguous character - the sort you're not totally sure of , watching his every facial gesture like it's another clue , or another devilish intonation . Compared to some of Hitchcock's more beloved classics this is sometimes a little crude in its construction , as well having to be subverted to the sound form ( one wishes a little for the big personalities of Hitchcock's 1930s British films ) . But all things considered , it's essential viewing , and shows the kind of breakthrough work that Hitchcock needed ( i . e . a hit ) that could get the ball rolling on his career in England - and not as a fluke , to be sure .

82,"Text1: Abraham Lincoln is D . W . Griffith's first sound film . Since this movie is only 92 minutes , it seems to divide Lincoln's life-from birth to his assassination-into fragments that are too short and hardly flow from one sequence to another . The saving grace is Walter Huston as the title character especially in a speech to an army deserter he tells to "" do his duty "" after he pardons him . There is also wonderful background music that occasionally serves as score whenever possible in this awkward early talkie . And the assassination scene ( which Griffith had staged before in The Birth of the Nation ) is beautifully done to gradual suspense . Then we hear a wonderful instrumental of "" Glory , Glory , Hallelujah ! "" as we pan first to the model woods and log cabin that we saw in the beginning and then to a model of the Lincoln Memorial ( having been to Washington recently I can tell a model from the real thing ) stopping on Lincoln himself as we fade out . This being Griffith's second to last picture , it's sad he wasn't given more of a chance to try to adjust to sound techniques but while this movie does feel creaky he still got good performances from Huston and most of the supporting cast ( although Una Merkel might have overdone it as Ann Rutledge ) .

An inquest is called & again Quincy finds himself up against his old pathology Professor , his loyalty & friendship is called into question as he searches for the truth no-one else seems interested in . . . Episode 5 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Ronald Satlof & The Two Sides of Truth is yet another great early example of Quincy & that it can successfully mix it's story lines & be varied yet still be entertaining . Here Quincy has to deal with personal conflict as his idol , teacher , mentor & the man he admires so much Dr . Stone seems to be selling his medical expertise to the highest bidder & will say just about anything in court for money . There are obviously other issues brought up as well like using expert witnesses who have something to gain from a certain outcome & how they might seek to suppress the truth & while not blatantly lie certainly not tell the complete truth or maybe omit a few facts here & there . Overall though those side issues don't overshadow a good solid murder mystery plot that Quincy uses his medical knowledge & skills to solve & the fact that most of the moral issues brought up involve Quincy himself in personal conflict means I found them more meaningful . The outcome of this episode is maybe a little bit too predictable & slightly too ' happyily ever after ' but it's fitting & works well enough . After the different set of opening titles as seen in the previous episode Visitors in Paradise ( 1977 ) the production team reverts back to the traditional titles which would remain the same for the rest of the entire run of six and a half more seasons although the main theme music would get revamped from time to time the actual titles stayed exactly the same . There's a very silly sub plot in The Two Sides of Truth about a clumsy laboratory assistant named Alice who Sam fancies breaking everything she touches who was promptly dropped & never seen again . The acting is alright although the regulars are better than the guest stars as usual . The Two Sides of Truth has a strong storyline about finding out the truth & not settling for anything less , a strong basic concept which would run through Quincy as a series & as a series would largely base itself upon that one single specific concept .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Often imitated , but never duplicated . Disney was at the top of the mountain as far as animation was concerned and this one is justifiably considered a classic . Well worth looking for . Most highly recommended .

Text2: Herb Freed ( Graduation Day ; Beyond Evil ) directs this psychological melodrama ( . . with elements of a slasher ) regarding the effects on a small town , and especially troubled Ingrid ( May Britt ) , as a sexual predator stalks vulnerable women at night with a pair of scissors after raping them . Ingrid is haunted by memories from childhood regarding finding her mother dead in a bathtub and possible sexual abuse at the hands of "" reliable "" Uncle Carl ( Cameron Mitchell , whose role is minor until the enigmatic ending where he supposedly returns to Ingrid's home where memories of his own resurface after being away for a while ) . It seems that Ingrid is being stalked by the town stud , Frankie ( William Gray Espy ) , who even rapes her in her own bedroom , holding scissors to her throat . Ingrid is a deeply devout Catholic who is suffering hallucinations thanks to her past ( . . blood is a constant ) and seems incredibly uncomfortable around men . Husky voiced , alcoholic sheriff ( Aldo Ray ) is truly puzzled about the attacks plaguing his once quiet , sleepy little town , and is quite concerned for his citizens , innocent women who might venture out at night alone . Trying to sober up , the sheriff will attempt to find the killer , keeping his deputies on alert , watching the country roads and neighborhood streets at night , hoping to catch him in the act . Meanwhile , Ingrid battles with her conscience and religious convictions after being raped . The film also subtly hints at the idea that her mysterious Uncle Carl might be the one responsible for the attacks . Also , a mannerly , soft-spoken stranger from Baltimore , Bill Spry ( Robert Hippard ) enters town hoping to date Ingrid , who seems little interested in making relations with any man . Director Freed and collaborative writer Anne Marisse craft a very tricky tale here which takes it's time building the attacks around Ingrid's story . The attacks themselves really are the Macguffen as the film centers around Ingrid , and serve to actually heighten her trauma . Through the surrounding attacks in town , Ingrid , slightly stable on a slender thread , goes off the deep end with the scissor-murders influencing her hostile fantasies . The film seems to have three endings . The police cornering the sexual sadist in a saw mill . Ingrid's confrontation with Frankie as a bound Carl tries to free himself . And , Ingrid's fate and the reactions from the sheriff and Carl relating the truth to the viewer . Freed doesn't hurry himself and the film takes it's time developing so it might can become tedious for some viewers ( . . such as choir practice and a bar conversation between Spry and a local gal-pal of Ingrid's who is a potential victim ) . I think one might also find the last thirty minutes tiresome due to the complexities of Ingrid and what is real and imagined . I found it worthwhile and thought Britt's performance was a stunner . The score from Pino Donaggio really adds quality to the tragedy ever so present throughout the film . Freed does an exceptional job incorporating Ingrid's memories within her life at the present , with Donaggio's somber music adding the right touch at reflecting her deteriorating mental state .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
86,"Text1: Terence Rattigan's ' Coronation ' ( it was commissioned to mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 ) play was something of a disappointment when staged initially ( later than intended ) with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in the two leading roles yet it re-surfaced twice more ; once ( here ) as a film , adapted by Rattigan himself , and once in 1963 as a Musical with a ' Book ' by Harry Kurnitz and music and lyrics by Noel Coward ( the last ' score ' he would compose for the theatre ) . Each time the title was changed ; Rattigan himself coined the most felicitous ( The Sleeping Prince ) for his original play ; this was changed to The Prince And The Showgirl for the film and finally The Girl Who Came To Supper for the stage musical ( incidentally one of Coward's witty numbers ' Long Live The King - If he Can ' had to be cut from the original show as it dealt humorously with assassination and opened in the wake of Kennedy's in Texas ) . Much has been made of Olivier the ' great ' actor , a quality which has always eluded me and here again he does little more than employ one of his ' funny ' voices ( at which , it must be said , he was quite adept ) and look stiff and so uncharismatic that it's difficult to imagine ANYONE falling in love with him . Rattigan - whether at the urging of his Producer or not - has opted to ' open ' out his original play so that now we get to ' see ' the procession en route to the abbey and scenes of the abbey itself . I've often failed to see what all the fuss was about regarding Marilyn Monroe but I have to say that here she is quite believable and competent as the Showgirl half of the title and though far from his best work Rattigan's lines and craftsmanship are always in evidence .

Text2: The Dardenne brothers make it look easy . Their films have simple story lines , basic photography , little or no music and certainly no cgi but they do have exceptional acting which is , in the main , free from the kind of histrionics that some actors assume IS great acting . Once again they offer a simple plot ; Man meets Baby , Man sells Baby , Man finds Baby . On paper , so what , but on film this becomes absorbing . We are introduced to the protagonists economically ; Sonia ( Deborah Francois ) , holding her newborn son , searches for the father , Bruno ( Jeremie Renier ) and finally locates him ' at work ' i . e . in the middle of a scam . Bruno's idea of making a living consists of supplementing Sonia's State help with petty crime and spending the money as fast as he makes it . His new-born son is just something else off which he can make money . Only when Sonia collapses on hearing that Bruno has sold their child do we , the audience , become aware that there is actually something besides himself that Bruno cares about and that is Sonia . I can only echo the accolades that I have read in previous comments here . Despite its downbeat subject this is a wonderful film and fans of the Dardennes will no doubt savour the cameo by Olivier Gourmet , who appeared with Renier in La Promesse .

The Hamilton's move house a lot , Franics is unsure why & is unhappy with the way things are . The fact that his brother's & sister kidnap , imprison & murder people in the basement doesn't help relax or calm Francis ' nerves either . Francis know's something just isn't right & when he eventually finds out the truth things will never be the same again . . . Co-written , co-produced & directed by Mitchell Altieri & Phil Flores as The Butcher Brothers ( who's only other film director's credit so far is the April Fool's Day ( 2008 ) remake , enough said ) this was one of the ' Films to Die For ' at the 2006 After Dark Horrorfest ( or whatever it's called ) & in keeping with pretty much all the other's I've seen I thought The Hamiltons was complete total & utter crap . I found the character's really poor , very unlikable & the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over it's 85 & a half minute too long 86 minute duration . The there's the awful twist at the end which had me laughing out loud , there's this really big sustained build up to what's inside a cupboard thing in the Hamiltons basement & it's eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy . Is that really supposed to scare us ? Is that really supposed to shock us ? Is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll ? Is a harmless looking young boy the best ' twist ' ending that the makers could come up with ? The boring plot plods along , it's never made clear where the Hamiltons get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work ( except David in a slaughterhouse & I doubt that pays much ) or why they haven't been caught before now . The script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror & it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective . A really bad film that I am struggling to say anything good about . Despite being written & directed by the extreme sounding Butcher Brothers there's no gore here , there's a bit of blood splatter & a few scenes of girls chained up in a basement but nothing you couldn't do at home yourself with a bottle of tomato ketchup & a camcorder . The film is neither scary & since it's got a very middle-class suburban setting there's zero atmosphere or mood . There's a lesbian & suggest incestuous kiss but The Hamiltons is low on the exploitation scale & there's not much here for the horror crowd . Filmed in Petaluma in California this has that modern low budget look about it , it's not badly made but rather forgettable . The acting by an unknown ( to me ) cast is nothing to write home about & I can't say I ever felt anything for anyone . The Hamiltons commits the cardinal sin of being both dull & boring from which it never recovers . Add to that an ultra thin story , no gore , a rubbish ending & character's who you don't give a toss about & you have a film that did not impress me at all .

Ragin ) ask's Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) to stop off at Bower County on his fishing holiday to help autopsy a seven year old boy named Christopher Reano ( Carl Stein ) who died at a care-home for children called Green Springs Retreat . The local pathologist & GP Dr . Curtis ( Tony Dow ) needs expert collaborative validation to help close Green Springs which keeps the children in appalling conditions , Quincy agrees with Curtis & is shocked at the state of Green Springs & the general state of child care in California . . . Episode 21 from season 8 this Quincy story was directed by William Cairncross & starts off promisingly enough but descends into some horrible moralistic family drama . The opening twenty odd minutes are pretty good as Quincy is shocked at what he finds at the Green Springs Retreat & lays into several people in the way only he can but then things switch back to Los Angeles & his wife Emily takes over & it becomes some awful moralistic drama about the break up of the family & the state of the welfare system . It's horrible , Quincy takes a back seat & barely features after the opening twenty minutes with Emily living with the family she is trying to save . That's all well & good but how can the state provide a psychiatrist for literally every family who has problems ? They can't , it would cost a fortune & I'm sure there aren't enough psychiatrist's to go around anyway . Boring horrible moral drama rubbish that pretty much keeps in line with much of season eight . I really don't think child care homes are as bad as this these days , I certainly think there are minimum standards & a home like Green Springs wouldn't get a licence . Some of the scenes in this are unintentionally funny , the part when Emily is role playing with the family & she assumes the role of the little kid while talking to his mum is rather funny . The acting is OK but the regulars are better than the guests . Suffer the Little Children ( the IMDb is wrong it's definitely Suffer the Little Children & not just Suffer the Children ) is another horrible moralistic outdated Quincy episode , just the sort of think I find hard to watch . Another disappointment from the largely disappointing season eight .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
88,"Text1: UNCONSCIOUS ( Inconscientes ) is a stylish little Spanish film form the minds of writers Dominic Harari and Joaquín Oristrell , a tongue in cheek look at the influence of Sigmund Freud on social behavior at the fin de siecle in Spain . Not only is the story highly entertaining as a comedy , the production values and creative direction by Joaquín Oristrell make this a must-see for lovers of European art films . The story is a bit convoluted , but then the title suggests that in the first place ! If there is a line of continuity it is the effect of Freud as the one who peeped into the privacy of our lives and the strange findings he discovered . Very pregnant Alma ( the always beguiling Leonor Watling ) is missing her psychiatrist husband and engages the aid of her brother-in-law Salvador ( Luis Tosar ) to find him . Alma's sister Olivia ( Núria Prims ) suspects a tryst between Alma and Salvador , adding a bit more mystery to the story . The discoveries made about each of the highly assorted groups of players in the drama are made in the oddest of places - a men's steam room / gym , a transvestite ball ( in which many of the characters ' form the outside world are found to have very special needs ! ) , and in places throughout the picturesque Barcelona . There is no particular resolution to this quasi-plot : the joy is in the telling of the story , and that is a total pleasure to watch . The very large cast is uniformly exceptional and the creative aspects of the shifting of the various components of this storybook tale are as fine as have been seen in recent cinema . This is comedy border but not becoming slapstick and it is served up delectably ! In Spanish and German with English subtitles . Grady Harp , November 07

Text2: Bride of the Monster opens on a dark stormy night , the wind howls as the rain lashes down between strikes of lightening and rumbling thunder . It's Lake Marsh and two men , Mac ( Bud Osborne ) and Jake ( John Warren ) are caught unawares by the storm and find themselves stranded . They seek refuge in ' Willow ' mansion owned by mad Russian scientist Dr . Eric Vornoff ( Bela Lugosi ) . Vornoff warns the men to leave . Before they can Vornoff's idiotic servant Lobo ( Tor Johnson ) creeps up behind them and sends them running back into the swamp . There Mac and Jake are attacked by Vornoff's monstrous creation that lives there , a giant octopus . Lobo manages to retrieve one of the men and take him back to Vornoff's laboratory where Vornoff sticks a siv with three spark plugs stuck to the top on his head . Vornoff then shines a light in his face , which proves fatal . Vornoff bemoans yet another failed experiment . Captain of homicide Tom Robbins ( Harvey B . Dunn ) calls Lieutenant Dick Craig ( Tony McCoy ) into his office to discuss the disappearance of twelve men near Lake Marsh . Lt . Craig says he has nothing to go on when his fiancé who works as a journalist , Janet Lawton ( Loretta King ) walks into Robbins office . Janet feels the police aren't doing everything they can so she decides to do some investigating of her own , much to the displeasure of Lt . Craig and Captain Robbins . After some research Janet drives out to Lake Marsh but crashes her car in a violent thunder storm and is kidnapped by Lobo . Back at headquarters Captain Robbins and Lt . Craig talk to the leading authority on Prehistoric monsters , Professor Vladimir Strowski ( George Becwar ) who convinces them that the legends of a monster surrounding the swamps may be true and along with Lt . Craig and his partner Detective Marty Martin ( Don Nagel ) decides to head out to the swamps to check things out . Vornoff dresses Janet in a white bridal gown ( I don't know why ) and prepares her to undergo more of his insane experiments which he hopes will create a race of Atomic supermen to conquer the world ! Once at the swamp Lt . Craig finds Janet's abandoned car with her nowhere to be seen . Will Lt . Craig be able to solve the mystery and rescue his fiancé Janet before she becomes Vornoff's latest experiment ? Or will he end up octopus food ? Written and directed by Edwood D . Wood Jr . I thought this film was nowhere near as bad as it's reputation suggests . In fact I was impressed with it considering all the negative things I had heard . Don't misunderstand me as it certainly isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but as a decent , fun , silly and entertaining 50's monster film I quite liked it . It moves along at a fair pace and at under 70 minutes it doesn't outstay it's welcome , but it did start to drag a little in the middle but it picked up again towards the end . The dialogue , although stupid at times , isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be . It's simple and basic but coherent . Obviously there are ' bad ' bits in the film , Vornoff's lab for instance is just a simple set with the stonework and bricks painted onto the walls to give the impression of an old Gothic dungeon . There is the odd continuity error and the special effects for the giant octopus are truly terrible , plus the octopus isn't really in it enough just a somewhat measly three times . The black and white photography by Ted Allan and William C . Thompson is simple but clean and crisp , at least you can see whats going on all the time which is all I was hoping for . Lugosi puts in a decent performance , Johnson is absolutely awful and he can hardly walk straight much less act and Dunn as Robbins is actually quite funny in a couple of scenes particularly when he questions the old woman in the records office . I really don't think this film deserves to be in the bottom 100 , I've seen many film much worse than this fairly innocent , fun and at times charming little 50's effort from Edward D . Wodd Jr . !

89,"Text1: Although there are some exceptional Westerns ( such as The Oxbow Incident , The Gunfighter and The Fastest Gun Alive ) , this is my favorite . I must first point out that Westerns are NOT among my favorite movies . I like them in small doses or when they rise above the crowd . This movie is GREAT in so many ways . First , the soundtrack is tops . It's magnificent in scope and fits the movie so well . Second , the acting is great . Particular standouts are Gregory Peck ( as the strong , confident yet humble newcomer ) , Charlton Heston , Charles Bickford and Burl Ives . Overall , this movie seemed to best showcase Ives and Peck , as their characters were so solidly written and mesmerizing . Third , as alluded to in the last sentence , the writing was incredible and it was in many ways an "" anti-Western "" that deliberately avoided clichés and debunked some of the macho excessiveness of some Westerns . Fourth , the brilliantly paced and masterful direction of William Wyler ( perhaps the greatest Director who ever lived ) . This is the plot in a nutshell : Gregory Peck is an Easterner who had been a ship's captain who met a girl ( Carol Baker ) and agreed to marry her and move back west with her . It turns out her father ( Bickford ) owns most of the county and is way too adamant on proving his machismo - - particularly when it came to altercations with another big-shot landowner ( Ives ) who is his rival . The problems all begin when Ives ' son ( Chuck Conners ) and his buddies give Peck a nasty hazing . Peck laughs it off but Bickford is bound and determined to "" teach that trashy clan a lesson "" . It becomes painfully obvious through the course of the movie that BOTH patriarchs are pig-headed bullies who won't back down until their rival is pushing up daisies ! Peck realizes this rather quickly but is disheartened that his fiancée is all for a countrywide bloodbath . Her lust for revenge and mayhem drives poor Gregory Peck away - - into the arms of the luscious schoolmarm ( Jean Simmons - - not THE Gene Simmons from KISS , but the actress ) . As a compromise , Peck offers to buy a piece of land under dispute by the two patriarchs and give them BOTH equal access to the land . Neither one really wants this solution , as it will preclude them from killing each other . I won't tell more about the basic plot or the conclusion , as it would spoil the experience , though there are a few WONDERFUL moments I want to highlight . First , the cowboys try to get Peck on an evil ( and seemingly unbreakable ) horse , but he declines . They think he's "" yellow "" but he just doesn't think he has to prove himself to others . Instead , when no one other than Raoul ( the servant - - who is exceptionally well-played ) , he tries again and again to ride the horse until he ultimately succeeds into saddle-breaking it . Second , for much of the movie , Charlton Heston ( Bickford's foreman ) is itching for a fight with Peck . Again and again , Peck backs off - - not because of perceived cowardice but because he has neither an argument with him nor did he feel I needed to fight . Now remember , Peck was introduced as an ex-sea captain - - this was certainly NOT a wimpy profession , but he was so self-confident in his own masculinity that he just felt no need to prove anything to himself or his fiancée . Finally , after repeated provocations , Peck agrees to fight but not publicly . Instead , they fight all alone in an open field . The fight lasts for what seems like hours , as they exchange blow after blow . All this is shown NOT with the typical closeup , but with a DISTANT shot in order to avoid glamorized the fight . Finally , after they both are spent , Peck asks Heston if this REALLY accomplished ANYTHING ! This was a beautiful moment . Overall , I think this movie's theme is REAL masculinity versus FAKE put-on masculinity and it does a masterful job .

Text2: The film has two main themes . A world-famous aviator ( Dix ) has slowly destroyed his once amazing career and he has his pilot's license revoked for being drunk in the cockpit . The film is about his rebuilding his life , though through very long stretches of the film he is absent or practically absent as the second plot took precedence during most of the film . A small aircraft manufacturer is trying to design a fighter plane in order to win a lucrative government contract . So much of the film concerns the struggles they go through as well as a budding relationship that never seems to get off the ground between the project manager and a female draftsman . As far as the plane goes , I know most who see the film won't notice some of the problems with how they executed the flying sequences and the plane itself . While the plane is supposed to be "" the latest thing "" and capable of flying over 400 m . p . h . , the design is actually similar to experimental craft being produced from 1932-1936 ( looking a lot like the airplane used in the old Universal Studios intros ) , so in so many ways the craft was totally obsolete . This isn't a real issue for the average person , but hey , for us aviation buffs it is noticeable . But what IS noticeable even for the casual viewer are the silly physics of the plane as it flies . It's very obviously a model and it executes turns that no plane EVER could make - - making the tiniest loop-to-loops and spins in history ! A little more money and effort could have made for much more realistic and less silly flying sequences . However , even despite these problems , the movie is about a seldom discussed topic and I found it very interesting from a historical standpoint . As for me , personally , I would score this movie a 6 or 7 , since I am a huge fan of the history of aviation and am a school teacher . However , I also understand that for the average viewer , this film will no doubt be pretty dull stuff and provide little entertainment . Also , as far as a the romance goes , it never really made much sense and never seemed to get past minor infatuation . Plus , for fans of Richard Dix ( and there must be a few out there ) , his role in the film is pretty small and not especially heroic - - despite him receiving top billing .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
90,"Text1: THE MIST has the full panorama of responses , from those who find it ' the best of the Stephen King story adaptations ' to those who find it a feeble attempt to wed science fiction with biblical predictions . Frank Darabont has successfully brought King's popular horror stories to the screen with great success . For this film his gathered a substantial cast , used computer generated graphics well , but in the end the result is a confusing mishmash of story versus sermon versus actors being overwhelmed by some really strange upstaging creatures . David Drayton ( Thomas Jane ) is a graphic artist who manages to weather a freak storm only to discover a mysterious mist hovering over his backyard lake . Going to town with his young son to get supplies at a Food Store he joins the other townsfolk in the gossip about the mist which now engulfs the town : could it be due to some experiment at the military post lab in the mountains ? The store's generator sounds like it is fumbling , and while brave David tries to fix it ( mind you , in this town with no electricity , the lights in the main store remain on . . . . ) , he sees the back wall buckling and hears a bizarre noise . Returning to the storefront , his findings are not believed - especially by the town psycho Mrs . Carmody ( Marcia Gay Harden ) who sees all things in relation to her channeling of God via her knowledge of the Book of Revelations , and the dubious out-of-towner Brent Norton ( Andre Braugher ) . But gradually David gathers some sensible folk ( Toby Jones , Chris Owen , et al ) to accompany him to the generator room and against David's warning , the back door is opened by the young stock boy and huge tentacles enter from the mist and consume the lad . Thus we have two factions : those who side with Mrs . Carmody's religious zealot need to sacrifice people to the outdoor monsters now flying about the store and those who are convinced they must fight the offenders with force and escape . The mess of a story is further confused with overlay of father / son devotion , mass hysteria , mob rule , revenge on the military for loosing these ' other world monsters ' on the public , and ' what do we do if this is the end of the earth ' . How it all winds down may satisfy some and may irritate others . So why rate this film with two stars instead of one ? Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as the crazy Mrs . Carmody and Toby Jones offers a solid representation of the stable man as a clerk in the store who keeps his wits about him . Thomas Jane is Thomas Jane , and for an action hero , he seems to melt with the circumstances . The movie is long , silly , not scary , and suffers from a weak script . For those who are entertained by this sort of story it may be worthwhile . For those who are fatigued by the same old line of good versus evil in the form of gooey huge monsters , pass on this film .

Text2: After a spate of roles that Robin Williams elected to play to prove he can be other than a funny guy , roles that were dark and foreboding , along comes the surprise film MAN OF THE YEAR and Williams has the opportunity to shine in both his unbridled comic banter and his more serious and even tender side . The film was marketed with a Thomas Jefferson cum George Washington wig atop Williams ' head and for this viewer that was enough to avoid the film in theaters . But don't be fooled by that bit of chicanery and foolish choice of PR : this film has so much truth about our political system that it is a springboard for the best in comic writing . Tom Dobbs is a late night talk show host with a political slant ( read Bill Maher type etc ) who responds to an audience question ' Why don't you run for President ? ' by deciding to do so , much to the chagrin of this manager Jack Menken ( Christopher Walken in a wonderfully underplayed role at last ! ) and writer Eddie Langston ( Lewis Black ) . Dobbs is just fed up enough with the government being run by people who have to pay off the lobbyists that get them elected and the big corporate supporters and spend money on everything BUT the people they serve : he seems to be as likely a candidate as any - and the public via email and media support prove him correct . He debates as an Independent candidate with both the Democrat and Republican and wins the debate hands down . AND he is elected . But there is a problem : The new voting system is by a computer company run by Alan Stewart ( Jeff Goldblum ) and workers Eleanor Green ( Laura Linney is a terrific role ) and Danny ( the hunky and fine David Alpay ) . Eleanor discovers a glitch in the computer program that reveals that Dobbs did not indeed win the election and the rest of the film is how she confronts Dobbs with the truth and how Dobbs and crew deal with it . Suffice it to say that Dobbs ' manner of coping makes us wish that he indeed were the President ! The cast is strong and for this viewer the fine balance between comedy and true drama that writer / director Barry Levinson achieves is not only the stuff of fine film making : it is also wise and should be viewed by a very wide audience . Robin Williams manages to be both his inimitable funny self as well as offer a touching three-dimensional performance of a citizen at odds with the current political system . And Laura Linney adds yet another fine role to her ever-increasing repertoire . Highly recommended . Grady Harp","{""output"": ""NO""}"

This 1992 movie was directed by Gary Nelson , and while not a masterpiece of the thriller genre , it is not without its own merits . If you haven't seen the film , perhaps you should stop reading .

During a night on the town with Aldo Testi , he is shot and becomes paraplegic . In his strong will to survive , he undergoes physical therapy that shows him how to use to the best advantage the wheel chair he must use for life . The action then switches to Barcelona , the beautiful city by the Mediterranean where Nick reacquaints himself with Aldo Testi , the bad guy he is trying to expose . We meet an amazing array of characters that are part of a new world for Nick . In a way , it's a big stretch of the imagination that Nick will survive the adventure because of his condition , but we go along for the ride , making excuses for what we know it's almost impossible . Aside from Mr . Urich , Dakin Matthews plays the FBI agent in charge of the operation . David Ryall makes a mean Aldo Testi . There are good appearances by some notable Spanish cinema stars .

Text2: Of course , the best way to view HOW THE WEST WAS WON is seeing it in all its splendor on a big theater screen as intended . My review is based on the full screen presentation on AMC , but it's obvious that the film had to be much more effective as a theatrical offering . First , the flaws : A boring narration by SPENCER TRACY is delivered in dull style by the actor and works against the material . The story itself tries to cram so much western history into the tale that it becomes a series of choppy vignettes that are only able to hint at all the pioneering spirit that went into the making of the American West . Furthermore , by putting DEBBIE REYNOLDS at the center of the piece only emphasizes the superficial aspect of some of the casting choices . Reynolds is so modern in behavior that she makes it hard to see her as a pioneer woman , but more like an MGM musical comedy actress who was stretching herself to play more serious roles . The bouncy musical score helps considerably in boosting the story values and is one of the more enjoyable aspects of watching the film . The performances that linger in the memory once the dust has settled are given by GEORGE PEPPARD , CARROLL BAKER , LEE J . COBB , ROBERT PRESTON and ELI WALLACH . Some less distinguished work by GREGORY PECK and HENRY FONDA fades into the background . Even JOHN WAYNE as General Sherman and HARRY MORGAN as Ulysses S . Grant fail to make much of an impression in brief cameos . The Civil War sequence was most impressive , with Baker and Peppard as mother and son before the conflict giving genuinely moving performances , she as an embittered mother resigned to losing her son to war and he as a naive farmboy anxious to join the fight . The liveliest and best staged sequence is the railroad attack that climaxes the film with some stunning camera-work of runaway trains and perilous stunts that grip the attention . The tacked on corny ending with Reynolds lifting her voice in song seems jarring after the realism of the action scene , symptomatic of the entire film which seems to be an uneven combination of sentimental corn and rousing action or battle scenes . Summing up : Episodic way of viewing history from Hollywood standpoint , but rugged western does have some stirring moments .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
93,"Text1: Okay , the reality show premise is five housewives of New York City . Housewives do housework but they have maids and housekeepers to take care of that and nannies and Au pairs to look after their children . I know this is supposed to be the East Coast version of the Real Housewives of Orange County , California . Okay , these five women are pretty shallow , self-indulgent , vain , conceited , and totally in love with themselves . I forgive their husbands who pay the ultimate price of the marriage . They look like fools ! The wives don't really need a lot of the luxuries but they have so much money that they have to spend it endlessly on themselves . Of course , there is the charities and fund-raisers but they probably spend more money on the dresses to go to the functions to be seen and heard . I bet there were a thousand or hundreds of eligible housewives . They narrowed it down to those who look like they posed out of swimsuit issues . They are as deep as a shallow pool and are as nearly interesting . I find it incomprehendable when one of the wives makes a snide comment about living in the suburbs . I live in the New Jersey suburbs and I know that many people can't afford to live here neither . There are thousands or millions of us struggling to get by on small paychecks . Maybe Bravo can do a show on the real housewives of New Jersey . They don't have the time to socialize with each other when they are too busy working two or three jobs and chauffeuring their children from place to place . I was appalled by the cost of a purebred dog at $1800 . 00 . Where is PETA ? This is an outrage when are thousands of dogs and cats eligible for adoption . The show is just too shallow for me . It's like watching a train wreck .

Text2: I remember when the network gave Marla Gibbs her own show as Florence Johnston who worked in a posh hotel with Ruth Brown and Liz Torres in the housekeeping department . Of course , Marla was much better on The JEffersons and when the show got canceled that Marla was welcome back on the Jeffersons . it proved how much she meant to the cast as wisecracking sidekick to Isabel Sanford and Sherman Hemsley as the Jeffersons in their upscale New York City apartment . Of course , the show never lasted long even with Marla Gibbs as Florence Johnston in her own series . Fortunately , she had gained sitcom stardom on 227 playing straight to Jackee's character . As Florence Johnston , Marla Gibbs was outstanding as the maid that you just love to hate and learn to love at the same time . Florence was never more truthful , honest , or kinder than when she was the with the Jeffersons . Thank God , the show did get canceled and we got Flo back .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: Cube 2 : Hypercube starts as Kate Filmore ( Kari Matchett ) awakes to find herself in a square room , a cube if you will . On each of the six faces of the cube is a hatch which opens & leads to an identical cube whose hatches lead to even more identical cube shaped rooms . As she goes from cube to cube she meets other people , there's Simon ( Geraint Wyn Davies ) , a blind girl named Sasha ( Grace Lynn Kung ) , a computer games designer Max ( Matthew Ferguson ) , Jerry ( Neil Crone ) , a senile old woman name Mrs Paley ( Barbara Gordon ) , lawyer Julia ( Lindsey Connell ) & General Thomas Maguire ( Bruce Gray ) who all find themselves trapped within an endless succession of cubes with no food , water or idea how to get out . As they learn about each other they must work together to try & figure out how to escape the seeming endlessness of the cube . . . This Canadian production was directed by Andrzej Sekula who was also the director of photography & was the first sequel to the ingenious & rather funky sci-fi / horror film Cube ( 1997 ) . I have now seen all the Cube films , although admittedly some months apart & in the wrong order , & I have to say Cube 2 : Hypercube is my least favourite although it's still probably worth a watch . The script by Sean Hood , Ernie Barbarash & Lauren McLaughlin takes the basic Cube premise of strangers being stuck in a cube & having to figure a way out & puts a couple of twists on things which in my opinion are not effective . The simplicity & fascination of the original is lacking here as the filmmakers introduce this silly fourth dimension thing which means all sorts of time-lines meet each other & gravity starts to get messed up , I just liked the pureness of the original Cube which is just absent here . For some reason they've done away with the bobby traps in the rooms as well , surely that's a mistake ? I also didn't like the somewhat predictable twist ending & the character's are poor this time around with most of them having some tenuous & dull reason to be there . The other factor to bear in mind is that while the Cube films are unique generally speaking they aren't amongst themselves which means there are another two films that are almost identical to this & out of the three films Cube 2 : Hypercube is the worst . Director Andrzej does an OK job although there's not much you can do to enliven a film up set entirely within one room shaped like a cube . He seems to like spinning the camera round peoples heads which can get a bit dizzying at times . There's no gore or violence this time around & why they did away with the bobby traps I'll never know . Technically Cube 2 : Hypercube is alright , what could go wrong with such a basic concept ? Having said that some of the CGI effects look really cheap & are unimpressive . The acting was OK but nothing special . Cube 2 : Hypercube is an OK watch , if you've never seen a Cube film before then you'll probably like it more than those that have . I suppose there's nothing really wrong with it other than it had an almost impossible task of following the original which it does with no great distinction . Average at best . The last , to date , film in the series was Cube Zero ( 2004 ) which is better than this .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
95,"Text1: What a curious film . Peter Lorre is Roderick Raskolnikov , an impoverished writer of magazine articles in what appears to be 1930s Russia . His whole family is in financial trouble . His sister Antonya is about to marry a pompous blowhard for his money . Lorre can't pay his meager rent . He's already pawned the watch passed on to him by his father . What to do , what to do ? Then it comes to him . Simply murder the old lady pawnbroker . Nobody likes her anyway , stingy old crow . And , after all , Lorre is an intellectual who has written a theory of crime resembling Nietzsche's . There are ordinary men who must play by the rules , and there are extraordinary men who can't be judged by the usual standards . Guess which kind Lorre considers himself . His heroes are Napolean and Beethoven . So Lorre visits the old lady at night and whacks her over the head with a poker , steals her stash and hides it under a small boulder . Nothing to it . On top of that , his editor gives him a promotion and a considerable raise and Lorre begins to get cocky , what with his new suit and all that . He liberates his family from poverty and throws the churlish old suitor out of the apartment , allowing his sister Antonya to link up with her true love . And he himself meets a young and beautiful whore and begins to slip her cash as well as other gifts . But then Lorre is called in to Police Headquarters to meet Inspector Porfiry , Edward Arnold . Arnold finds Lorre waiting for him in the anteroom , shivering with fear . But Arnold isn't interested in Lorre because of the murder . Not at all . He wants a friendly chat with Lorre because of Lorre's recent article on criminality . Lorre is at first wary , then superior , then sweaty with guilt , giving himself away in iotas of implications . Examples : ( 1 ) When Lorre first meets Arnold , they are interrupted when a suspect of the murder is brought it and accused . At the mention of "" murder "" Lorre faints . Arnold begins circling his prey , all the while denying he has any interest in Lorre as a suspect . Example : Arnold visits Lorre in his flat and , chatting jovially , lights up a cigarette , goes to the iron stove , bends over and flicks the match inside . "" Yes , "" Arnold announces . "" I'm as certain that you're innocent as I am that THERE IS NO POKER IN THIS ROOM . "" This sort of insinuation , this cat-and-mouse game , is in some ways the most interesting part of the plot . It's like Lieutenant Columbo , except that here the murderer is plagued by a guilty conscience . Lorre becomes obsessed with the crime he's committed . He can't seem to get it out of his head . He begins to misinterpret the innocent remarks of others . When his girl friend , the hapless hooker , Marian Marsh , begins to read the Bible story of Lazarus coming back from the dead , he hears the line about "" the rising of the stone "" and becomes enraged because it seems to hint that the hiding place of his loot will be discovered . He's forgotten all about "" Lazarus come forth , "" which is just as well because Lazarus came fifth and lost the job . I can't remember the details of the novel all that well , nor all the characters and their characteristics . I DO remember that Antonya was Dunya in the translation I read . I also remember that the murder weapon was not a poker but an ax . ( Yuck . ) And that Roskolnikov killed not just the mean pawnbroker but another woman who appeared on the scene , though I might be wrong about that . And in the novel , or rather in my memory of the novel , Inspector Porfiry doesn't just come out and nail Roskolnikov with , "" You murdered her and you're going to pay for it . "" Instead , Porfiry gently prods Roskolnikov into asking , "" Well , who murdered her ? "" This allows Porfiry to gape in amazement and reply , "" Why YOU did , Roskolnikov . "" I'm not sure why this movie isn't more gripping than it is . Directed by the famous von Sternberg . Maybe it's the casting . Roskolnikov is a young , starving student , thin and ragged , not the chubby little Peter Lorre . Lorre had been so successful as the murderer in "" M "" that maybe someone thought he would be good for a second go at a similar role . And Edward Arnold is not the Inspector Porfiry who edges crablike into Roskolnikov's life . Arnold is an intimidating and domineering blowhard . The confusion and puzzlement that came so easily to Lieutenant Columbo is not Arnold's strong suit .

Text2: Howard Hughes was a producer that had a lot of talent for discovering beautiful women that went on to have better careers with other vehicles than the ones he decided to create for them . That seems to be the case of this John Sturges ' 1955 film "" Underwater ! "" in which the curvaceous Jane Russell starred for the last time for Howard Hughes . The film is a curious one . We are introduced to Johnny and Dominic , two underwater divers who are searching for those sunken ships in the Caribbean , especially this one , not too far from Cuba . As they stumble into the old Spanish galleon , they find a man that appears to be a sort of pirate awaiting for them because it's obvious they are after those treasures . As Johnny and Dominic go back to Cuba , we are introduced to Theresa , Johnny's wife , who is dead set against spending money chasing his dreams . But when Dominic meets Gloria , by chance , she tells him about the yacht she has been left with by a departing old flame . So the four friends , and a priest who knows about those sunk ships , go in search of the riches trapped underwater . The film doesn't bring anything new to this film genre . In fact , it's pretty tame stuff we see in a predictable story we know how it will end . The best reward for the viewers of "" Underwater "" is the beautiful Jane Russell at her best . She was one of the sultriest women working in films during those days . The problem is the male stars who give by the numbers performances . Joseph Calleia is the only one that shows any spunk as the man who wants the riches from under the sea .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
96,"Text1: I have an affinity for sports bio-pics because they usually celebrate qualities such as hard work , perseverance , and sometimes sheer luck for an athlete to overcome the incredible odds facing them , and to come up on top . Naturally winning is all that matters , because nobody remembers the losers ( unfortunately ) , and it's always inspiring to witness how others overcome their challenges which sometimes surpass that of which an individual could handle . If an equivalent of a sports bio-pic is to be done in the Singapore context in relation to the Olympics , it could perhaps be our pioneering medalist , weightlifter Tang Howe Liang , to relate how he went quite on his own without the current support structure in place for our athletes of today , to win glory for our nation . Similarly , Liu Changchun ( Li Zhaolin ) goes down in China's history books as the first athlete to represent China and a medal winning one at that in the 1930s 10th Olympic Games held in Los Angeles , USA . And naturally the road to glory is not paved in gold , especially when you look at the tumultuous period he belonged to in China's history , where they were on the brink of the Sino-Japanese war , and the country in turmoil with priorities other than to consider expending budget in sending an athlete overseas to compete . It's an incredible pressure and one can only imagine the immense anxiety he has with the burden to shoulder the hopes of millions of people , in epitiomizing all of them with the indomitable spirit to compete at the highest level , and to shake off the "" Sick Man of Asia "" tag given the Japanese invasion . Representing the hopes of a nation , especially for a pioneer , can be nerve wrecking , but for the support from this father and understanding wife , he begins on the arduous journey to get himself represented , which this movie spent a lot of time focusing on the difficulties from war to crippling bureaucracy . Those moments were told in flashbacks , and we chart his trip to the USA from the start on sea , where he's travelling with only his coach Professor Song ( Shi Liang ) as they try to squeeze in some minimal training . And with inexperience comes the bickering with his coach , with one wanting to train continuously , against the coach's recommendation to cater for some adequate rest time . And as we know , sometimes lessons are learnt the hard way , which requires some eating of the humble pie to root one back to reality after a series of overconfidence . The movie boasted very high production values , with no efforts spared in having nifty special effects recreating countless of moments , from sets to backgrounds used to capture and recreate the era and the Games back then . The narrative also took a leaf out of Forrest Gump in having juxtapose the current actors into those black and white archival footage , and did so very competently and convincingly . Director Hou Yong also filmed the sprints under very exciting terms , with slow motion ( otherwise everything would be over in mere seconds ) and tight angles to frame all the action , which probably required multiple takes given the multiple angles shown , and to imagine the attention to details and accuracy to have the actors all come in at the right moments as cast in historical stone . If there is a gripe , I thought they should have filmed the winning race , rather than to not to so , with the narrative ra-ra about determination and the likes set the expectation that he's on a winning streak . Li Zhaolin was very believable as an Olympic medal winner given his very chiselled features and well toned body befitting an athlete . Notable cameos include David Wu and Hu Jun as a general / headmaster . And yes , Singapore also had a contribution here with Sun Yanzi being part of the singing ensemble for the team song , along with the likes of Jackie Chan and Wang Lee Hom . I had the chance to watch this as inflight entertainment but sleep overrode that opportunity . And I am thankful to have watched this , as it drops automatically into my recommended list of films to watch in relation to the Olympic theme this festival seems to be taking .

Text2: I admire filmmakers who manage to explore powerful relationships and character development in a tight two hours , and Spanglish falls into this category perfectly . As the name goes , "" Spanglish "" is a combination of two words - Spanish and English , and is one of the major themes covered in this film , which is the clash of cultures , and the fear of dilution of cultural values . Paz Vega plays Mexican ( illegal ) immigrant housekeeper Flor , to an All American family , Mr and Mrs Clasky , played by Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni . They have 2 children Bernice and Georgie , and live with Tea's mother in a rich suburb . All seems well at first , but cracks start to appear as the story develops , as Paz discovers during the course of her work . The father is self deprecating as he is easy going , the mother is neurotic most times and imposes her wishes on the children ( especially the chubby daughter , whom she thinks must lose weight ) , the daughter upset with her mum for that expectation of her , a son who sings his grandmother's jazz oldies , and an alcoholic grandmother . A large part of the narrative takes place during the summer home , with major character development and relationships take over as the center-stage in this film . It is natural that the interactions between the characters develop from what it was in the beginning , to what it is at the end . Some turn for the better , while others just couldn't be . The importance of family and family values are explored . I will attempt to dissect the major relationships : John and Deborah Clasky : As husband and wife , it seems that their relationship isn't that good to begin with . With his easy going nature , John tends to give in to Deborah on a lot of things . Deborah expects her husband to not be the "" good guy "" to the kids , but to be in agreement with her on issues she deems as important and in her opinion , correct for the kids . Their relationship gets put to the test when one of the commits adultery , while the other is unwittingly being tempted into his own . John and Flor : As employer employee , they develop mutual respect for one another when they realize that they share similar values . To communicate with John , she takes up self-study English lessons , and their friendship progressed to mutual liking . They share the same parental anxiety and have frequent honest conversation expressing their thoughts . However , they develop feelings for each other , and find difficulty on where to draw the line between their ever increasing desire to be close . When the line is crossed , do you call it quits because it's the correct thing to do ? The last 30 minutes of the film is tinged with sweetness from this blossoming romance which couldn't develop further by virtue of principles . You are left wondering , what if ? Deborah and Cristina , Flor's daughter : When Deborah entices and unwittingly seduces Cristina into the all American lifestyle , so much so as even lying to her mum . Deborah is taken to Cristina because she is what her daughter could probably never be - smart , thin and beautiful . Cristina , on the other hand , enjoys Deboarh's company and attention because , hey , it's the American Dream , no ? Flor and Cristina : The movie is narrated by Cristina , from the time when she was little and her father walks out of the home , the hardships that mother and daughter endured through their journey to the USA , and her understanding of her mother's hardship with work to bring her up singlehandedly . Flor is understandably protective of her daughter's wellbeing , and especially in teacher her correct values and her heritage . She becomes jealous when Deborah , in her eyes , start to become more important to her daughter , and sometimes envious of the material wealth that Deborah showers on Cristina that Flor can never ever provide for . Flor fears that her child will be "" hijacked "" by Deborah . Deborah and her daughter Bernice : Her daughter at times resents the attention that her mum is giving Cristina , as she knows that she could never be thin as expected by mum . She has fears comparisons . Bernice and Flor : Flor starts off as work being strictly work , and no intervention into the family affairs . But she felt compelled to help when Bernice feels upset when Deborah subconsciously puts her down , most of the time subtle digs at her weight . Flor becomes Bernice's confidante in that sense , and John points out to her the hypocritical ways in which she disallows Deborah to treat her own daughter Cristina in similar ways . That scene between John , Flor and Cristina is comedic at times , but powerful nonetheless . Other relationships too long for this review to cover , and also they are quite minor , but at the end of the show , most relationships stay intact because blood runs thicker than water . The main casts excelled in their performance , but I like to single out Adam Sandler . He has demonstrated that he is capable and comfortable doing drama , instead of the madcap comedic characters we associate him with . I hope he does films of different genres to highlight his capability as a serious actor . Also catching my attention in a cameo is Sideways ' Thomas Haden Church . This is a touching drama with an ending that some might deem as heart-wrenching , but I highly recommend this film .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

98,"Text1: A ( very ) loose adaptation of the novella "" Camilla "" . Starts right off with a bang when a female vampire being beheaded but that's about it for graphic violence . It's basically about a beautiful lesbian vampire ( Ingrid Pitt ) who is going after every young attractive woman around . That's about it for the plot . I have ( vague ) recollections about seeing this at a drive-in when I was 8 ! I do remember Pitt attacking some men and a pretty mild ( for now ) lesbian sequence which had quite a reaction from my parents - - my mother was disgusted , my father was enjoying it and I couldn't figure out WHAT was going on ! I figured they were just good friends . I remember liking it . . . but I was very young . Seeing it now it does have its moments . There are some very erotic , beautifully filmed sequences . There's next to no violence but there's plenty plenty of female nudity . As a gay man I found this pretty dull . It contains the same overly familiar Hammer sets found in all their other films and has a pretty vague plot ( who IS that guy in black on the horse ? ) . Also a beheading at the end is SO obviously fake . On the positive side Peter Cushing is on hand to give another good performance and Pitt is very beautiful and is a pretty good actress - - some of her expressions are priceless ! And Jon Finch is handsome and hunky as the main hero . But , all in all , I was bored . The lesbian bits are tame by todays standards ( I heard they were considered pretty extreme for 1970 ) and - - unless you're interested in lesbian vampires or pointless female nudity - - this is pretty dull stuff . I give it a 3 for some of the acting and good direction - - but I can't recommend this .

Yes , and though the color process on the photography is typically brackish and the technical aspects of "" Grace Quigley "" seem slapdash , this turns out to be a quirky , exceptionally funny piece about a hit-man's friendship with an elderly woman in New York . Reportedly , Hepburn and Nick Nolte clashed during filming , but you'd never suspect that from the finished returns ( they have an easy rapport ) . The crux of the plot ( that aged folks would rather die mercifully at the hands of a hired killer then live in loneliness or pain ) was controversial in 1984 - - and still smacks of bad taste - - yet director Anthony Harvey keeps the whole thing bubbling like the most genial of comedies .

Text2: ' Moonlight ' is ( so far ) the only movie I've ever seen that was shot in Luxembourg , but I fervently hope it's not a typical example of Luxembourgeoise cinema . This movie is a lot more arty-tarty than it needs to be . For starters , the title is nearly irrelevant : some of the action takes place in a house named Mondschein ( ' moonlight ' ) , but that name is completely arbitrary and unrelated to the plot . SPOILERS COMING . ' Moonlight ' is the first movie I've seen that's directed by Paula van der Oest , and ( again ) I fervently hope this is not a typical example of her craft . In ' Moonlight ' , she shows a penchant for camera set-ups that are distracting and serve no useful purpose . When young Claire feeds her dog , van der Oest plumps for an overhead shot as if we were watching a Busby Berkeley musical . Later , Claire and the fugitive boy break into a house during the resident family's absence , and then attempt some sexual fumblings in the parents ' bed . . . only to be caught in the act when two people walk in . Van der Oest uses a very contrived camera set-up to make us think that the arrivals are the parents , then uses a reverse angle to reveal that they are actually the family's son and daughter . The switcheroo serves absolutely no purpose except to disorient us . Elsewhere , Claire tells the boy that she's a foundling : is this true , or is it a lie told in a childish attempt to impress him ? We never find out . Either way , it's irrelevant to the story . ' Moonlight ' could have been a straightforward thriller . A boy from an unnamed country ( apparently Turkey ) has arrived in Luxembourg as a drugs ' mule ' , his digestive tract packed with condoms filled with narcotic contraband . When he fails to excrete them quickly enough , a drugs runner shoots him and leaves him for dead . . . but stupidly doesn't bother to check . The girl Claire finds the boy and helps him , but oddly she never tells her parents about him . ( If she's a foundling , they must be her foster parents . ) Very implausibly , she runs away from home with the boy , having no clear destination in mind . Are there no police in Luxembourg ? The film places some emphasis on pubescent sexuality : Claire experiences her menarche just before she finds the bleeding boy , and there's some attempt to equate her bloodstained knickers with his bloodstained gut . Later , there's a deeply implausible sequence in which the two runaways enrol themselves in a girls ' convent school , where the nuns accept them without question . Claire introduces the boy as her sister : he is very clearly male ( even while wearing a Communion dress ) , yet all the nuns and at least one priest automatically accept him as a girl . Speaking of girls ' clothing , I could have done without the shot of the Down's Syndrome girl stripping off to her bra and underpants . Obscure joke : Claire's dog is named Quick , and at one point the dog seems to have a stunt double . I couldn't help wondering if the stunt double's name is Flupke . ( Americans won't get this reference . ) This is one of those movies in which increasingly contrived events keep happening . . . and AFTER each one occurs , we realise that it didn't really happen after all : Claire seems to be turning more and more hallucinatory as the film proceeds . At the end of the film , Claire commits suicide by an extremely implausible method . Or . . . DOES she ? Sheesh ! I well and truly wanted to like this film .

Angela Bennett ( Sandra Bullock ) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors . Then , through a series of events , her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people , and she can't prove that she exists . Some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched ; you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie . Still , it's a good look into what the existence of the Internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people . I do recommend it .

Chris Tucker was bad enough when he was in the Fifth Element but someone's decision to put him in another movie and pair him up with Jackie Chan was certainly a wrong one . It's cool to see and hear Jackie speak English but every time Tucker opened his mouth everyone in the audience squirmed . I haven't seen such nausea since THE CARE BEARS MOVIE 2 . The plot ( ? ) in this film is pure , unimaginative and uninspired trash and the title is also completely meaningless . There is NO rush hour and just because Jun Tao's sidekick says that it's rush hour in a very short scene ( even when there's no traffic ) there is no reason for this film to have such a useless name . The writers ( did this have any ) didn't care much about naming there baby . I would need 10 hands to count the amount of movies that I have seen that end with the bad guy's suitcase full of money ( highly clichéd ) raining down on the hero .

Instead it's total unmitigated lowbrow crap , plain and simple ( with a definite emphasis on the simple , too ) . The so-called plot concerns two overaged , but very fetching sorority pledges and a trio of moronic , obnoxious frat boys who have to break into a bowling alley late at night and steal a bowling trophy as part of an initiation prank . The dim-witted quintet accidentally unleash a mischievous and diabolical imp who speaks with a pretty dreadful ersatz African American accent ; said troublesome little bugger gleefully wreaks plenty of enjoyably inane tongue-in-cheek supernatural havoc upon the idiotic collegians . Tireless celluloid dreckmeister supreme David ( "" Creepazoids , "" "" Deadly Embrace "" ) DeCoteau keeps the silly shenanigans bumping along at a reasonably quick clip , the nonstop sophomoric gags are quite amusing in an admittedly crude sort of way , and both the cinematography and production values are surprisingly slick given the paltry nickel'n'dime budget . Moreover , immortal 80's trash horror scream queen Linnea ( "" Silent Night , Deadly Night , "" "" The Return of the Living Dead "" ) Quigley contributes a spirited and engaging performance as a spunky punkette burglar while the always reliable George "" Buck "" Flower lends able support as a frisky , doddering , irascible old coot of a hopelessly senile janitor . Better still , the sexy , slinky , smoldering Brinke ( "" The Slumber Party Massacre "" ) Stevens takes an utterly gratuitous , but much-appreciated lengthy shower and buxom brunette honey Michelle ( "" Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers "" ) Bauer spends the bulk of her screen time in the buff . Of course this film overall is essentially an extremely cheesy , lamebrained and worthless hunk of absolute junk , but this baby nonetheless still constitutes as one of those true schlock movie rarities : it's a thoroughly shameless , pointless and witless rip-snorting snotwad of a flick that's every bit as blithely tacky and trashy as its glaringly obvious title would suggest . I plead guilty as charged on the grounds that I dug every last sublimely stupid minute of this braindead timewaster .

Directed with remarkably infectious go-for-it style and verve by Eric Weston and featuring plenty of outrageously over-the-top gruesome splatter ( gory highlights include a heart being torn out of someone's chest , a head being spun around and Coopersmith splitting a guy's noggin in two with a sword ) , a little gratuitous nudity ( the luscious Lynn Hancock warrants special kudos here as a comely , but bitchy secretary who gets attacked and eaten by ferocious demonic pigs while taking a shower ) , and a boffo shoot-the-fireworks wild climax set in a church , this funky early 80's low-budget "" Carrie "" clone sizes up as a whole lot of gleefully mindless schlocky fun .

Lon Chaney plays an armless circus performer , a knife thrower , who , well , is not quite honest about his existence . He's in love with the circus ringleader's daughter , played by Joan Crawford . A strong man named Malibar is in love with her , but she can't stand being touched by a man's hands and arms . Instead , she prefers to hang around with the armless ( and ergo handless ) Chaney . He has no doubts that he's in love with her , but does she love him ? She seems to . . . The Unknown works as a bizarre circus film , a horror film , and a psychological drama . Lon Chaney is at his best here . He really affected me with his performance . This film is actually prime to be remade . It is a masterpiece , I think , but it could stand to be much longer ( what , it's only 54 minutes , I think ) . The psychological and emotional depth could be even further expanded , making an even greater masterpiece . Unfortunately , I think if you proposed such an original script today , even if it is a remake of a classic film , the Hollywood producers and script readers would just laugh at you . Maybe a director with clout could get it done . Perhaps Spike Jonze of Being John Malkovich fame ? Actually , this must have been at least half of the inspiration for Alejandro Jorodowsky's 1986 masterpiece Santa Sangre , the other half being inspired by Hitchcock's Psycho .

Text2: This may be Tsai's first film set and made in his homeland of Malaysia , but he doesn't stray at all from Tsaiville . Which isn't much of a problem , really , if you're a fan of the director . Sure , we could complain that he's been hitting the same notes for eight features now , but there are artists in every medium that are like this . Either we get sick of it , or we like it and we stick with it . I'm sticking with Tsai . His moods and rhythms haunt my mind . He captures images like no other director , and he's definitely one auteur whose work you could identify from just one shot ( granted , you have about ten times as many frames in that one shot as you do in your average auteur's work ! ) . I Don't Want to Sleep Alone is probably my least favorite of all of his films ( all of which I've seen except his previous , The Wayward Cloud ? I've seen the first five minutes and am aching to finish it ) . This is mostly because I wasn't too sure what was going on through much of it . The plot seems to concern a young Chinese man ( played by Tsai's boytoy / regular Lee Kang-sheng ) who gets beaten senseless in Kuala Lumpur . A construction worker saves him and nurses him back to health , mostly with lustful intentions . But when the Chinese man is up and about , he goes off and sleeps with some women , which understandably pisses off his savior . Then there was a bunch of stuff I didn't quite understand , notably a guy in a coma ( also played by Lee Kang-sheng ) . A lot of my favorite shots involved that guy , but I'm not 100 % sure what was going on in that plot line . The images here are top notch , and though there is little dialogue , Tsai's use of sound ? and music ? is wonderful . Much as Tsai uses Taipei , Kuala Lumpur is an area of urban alienation . Late in the film smoke drifts over from a nearby Sumatran forest fire , covering the city with a thick haze . Many of the scenes are set in a crumbling building ( not quite sure what this was all about , really ) , which reminds me of the post-apocalyptic landscape in my favorite Tsai film , The Hole . I actually think I might have enjoyed this more had I watched it when I was less tired . Unfortunately , I'm not sure I want to give it another chance with the awful DVD , courtesy of Strand Releasing . It's cropped , for one thing . The image also looks a lot less crisp than any of Tsai's other films , though that may have been his stylistic choice this time around .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Tod Browning's "" Dracula "" looks and moves like an Ed Wood movie ; you can practically see the crewmen hiding just outside of the frame , holding the strings of the fake bats that come flapping up and down and blowing fake fog on to the screen with a fan . This movie only has one or two creepy scenes ; I was sorely disappointed with the rest . Bela Lugosi is effective as the famous Count , but everyone else is terrible , the pacing is sluggish , and the movie just ends , as if the director ran out of film . Did Monty Python direct this ?

He's committed to a mental institution until he's able to regain control of his faculties . Once he does , he begins to suspect that he wasn't responsible for his wife's death after all and so begins a fight with the hospital's staff to convince them that he's not a raving nutjob and merely seeks the truth of what happened . We know he's not guilty , mostly because he's played by Robert Taylor , and the female doctor assigned to his case ( played by the lovely Audrey Totter ) begins to realize that too , right around the time she starts to fall in love with him .

104,"Text1: Before the Revolution , Bernardo Bertolucci's second film , is kind of a mess . He was only 22 when he made it , and he must have made it immediately after he finished his first film , Grim Reaper . It's obvious that he's a genius from this film . Like I said , it's kind of a mess , but no more beautiful mess has ever been created in the cinema . The story is difficult to follow at times , but it is basically about a young bourgeois man who falls in love with his young aunt . Their relationship is socially unacceptable , so it immediately begins to break apart . As it does , politics rush into the film , confused politics , probably representing Bertolucci's own conflicting feelings at this point . The whole film feels very personal . I don't know . I really didn't catch too much of , well , what's going on . Which sounds bad , but there's a good reason for my missing everything : Bertolucci's direction is breathtaking . It is a nice cross between French New Wave and the Modernist movement that the Italian filmmakers were going through at the time . Bertolucci throws every single cinematic trick into the film that he can fathom . Everything works , though . It's showy , to be sure , but it's never less than one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced . It never seems less than amazing . The emotions of the film - and they really hit home , even if the story is difficult to follow - are fractured and manic . I need to watch Before the Revolution again . I feel , though , that even if I find it completely flawed the second time around , it could be nothing less than the greatest flawed masterpiece ever produced . 10 years after Before the Revolution , Bernardo Bertolucci directed what I consider my third favorite film , Last Tango in Paris . By then , he had perfected his style . I'll be adding another Bertolucci film to my list of favorites tonight .

Text2: Sure , Star Wars is a lot of fun . It's a great way to waste some time or to keep people entertained at a party or something . However , it's unbelievable how crazy people have become about it . In fact , people are so insanely in love with it that they actually convinced themselves that The Phantom Menace was a good movie . Now that's the power of persuasion ! Let's travel back in time three entire decades . In 1970 , George Lucas made his first feature after graduating from film school . Francis Ford Coppola , two years away from capturing one of the greatest films ever made , helped young Lucas produce it . It is THX 1138 , which is the name given to the film's hero , played by Robert Duvall , who was not yet extraordinarily famous ( perhaps people would recognize him from Robert Altman's MASH , in which he had co-starred earlier that year ) . The setting is a post-apocalyptic , underground complex . I have to throw out a caveat right here : I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic movies , and generally like all of them . And , in my opinion , this is one sci-fi sub-genre where the cheaper a production is , the better it is . My favorite ever is L . Q . Jones ' 1975 cult classic A Boy and His Dog . Heck , I even liked Robert Altman's Quintet quite a bit . What I like about these three films , what they have in common , is that they don't spend a lot of time explaining their back-stories . A Boy and His Dog gives a brief account of the major event in its history , but does not explain what came afterwards . THX 1138 is surely much more widely known than either A Boy and His Dog and Quintet , simply because of its creator . Lucas ' film gives us hardly anything to establish its setting in time . Of course , as conventions would determine , we all assume that it was some nuclear holocaust or unbearable pollution . But Lucas really gives us little information about what is going on . When sub-genres get so specific like this , where one film is so close to its predecessors , whether those predecessors are films or even novels ( no one could mistake the 1984ish tones of the film ) , the screenwriter and director really don't have to tell us much . So if these films are so close , why should anyone like them ? Well , because you're not supposed to rely wholly on the plot for the films ' worth . This is cinema , not literature . What we have to pay attention to is , well , one , the narrative structure , that is , how the story develops , not what the story is ( that's a part of literature , too , but it's a good variable in this genre ) . Two , these stories do differ in their settings , which is a major part of the authors ' creativity . Three , cinematic techniques . Well , THX 1138 can be credited with having a very good structure . It does progress linearly , but , as I said above , it gives just the tiniest hints of what's actually happening in the film and what the characters are thinking . There is very little dialogue , and a lot of it is difficult to decipher . The setting : George Lucas has great success here . He has all the sets as white as possible , and these sets mostly consist of hallways . Very cheap , and very effective . This comes in a lot if you're going to discuss the cinematography . Lucas also makes his characters wear white , scientific outfits , often covering everything but the characters ' heads or faces . In possibly the best sequence in the film , Duvall is put in a prison that has no visible walls or corners or doors or anything . It's just pure white , and it's simply deafening . And since the prisoners are wearing white , too , it looks like they're all lost in some sort of hideous limbo . Lucas also creates the best visual compositions in his entire career . Star Wars is rather bland visually . Nice colors , I suppose , but there's hardly any attention paid to composition . I was lucky enough to see THX 1138 in widescreen , and Lucas very carefully composed the shots . He's especially good here at posing his actors in an artistic way , while not making it obvious that he had deep artistic intentions when directing them . To tell you the truth , I couldn't relate what actually happens in this story at all . I have to blame part of that on my sleepiness tonight . However , even when I didn't fully understand it , I recognize it as a great movie , a masterpiece , perhaps . .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Having signed Julie Garfield from the Group Theatre Warners thrust him into one tough - guy - who - never - had - a - chance vehicle after another after it paid off handsomely in his debut Four Daughters . Not one to balk at hedging their bets the freres Warner teamed him once again with Priscilla Lane in this slice of hokum rather than slice of life opus . If Howard Hawks had a knack for coming in at the tail-end of a genre and making the definitive example ( see : Only Angels Have Wings ) Lewis Seiler just came in at the tail-end of a genre and added nothing . Garfield gets out of stir at the beginning only to be informed by the warden that he had been wrongfully convicted ; he then gets a series of bad breaks punctuated by false hopes until it all ends in smiles . Along the way he is helped by several people who behave unrealistically , somehow acquires a camera whilst not having change of a match and . . . well that's about as credible as it gets .

Text2: This was screened late last night on the BBC and provided another chance to see this excellent film written by and starring Michael Palin who based the story on his own great-grandfather who left Oxford to marry a woman he met whilst on holiday . Public School / Universities are , of course , something the British film industry does very well , indeed the Original ( 1951 ) The Browning Version with Michael Redgrave is one of the finest British films of all time and American Friends makes a fine addition to the ranks . The mores of 1860s Oxford are beautifully captured and full of details and the late Robert Eddison , primarily a stage actor , brings his mellifluous second-only-to-Gielgud voice fully to bear in all his scenes . Palin also captures to perfection the product of years of conditioning on the verge of becoming set in his ways and then undergoing a life-changing meeting . There is strong support all round with Connie Booth turning in a just-right reading of a maturing woman daring to hope for a bite at the cherry and hiding her disappointment and Alfred Molina more or less phoning in his standard cad about campus .

106,"Text1: It surprised me that this Hong Kong comedic franchise still had some legs to carry on with yet another installment , given that it's been some 12 years since the last film , which started off in 1992 starring Stephen Chow at his element , filled with plenty of "" mo-lei-tau "" jokes , and its fair share of obvious spoofs from well know movies . It's title ties in with none other than its release over the Lunar New Year period of the year , because it's believed that cinema goers automatically head for the comedies showing in the cinemas . Right , Jack Neo ? Each installment of the franchise share links with one another only in the title of the movie timestamped with the year , and its ending with the usual fanfare song and dance to usher in the Lunar New Year as well . And the second movie in 1993 was actually filmed in Singapore's now defunct and demolished Tang Dynasty City , being one of the rare ( if not the only ) film to have been done in its entirety at the location . Clifton Ko , who had been assuming directorial duties then , has now turned it over to Vincent Kok , while together with Raymond Wong , they retain producer credits . Just how zany or irreverent this addition to the franchise can become ? Unlike the previous films , the number of direct references for spoof purposes is much more obscure . Gone are the blatant in your face sight gags played just for laughs , and though there are the much touted scenes of emulating Daniel Craig's bare bodied emergence from the sea in Casino Royale , the actual scene is contrary to what the movie still would have you believe . Other references and cameo appearances / spoofs also take on a much subtler approach , so for an audience who blinked , you can forget about any rip-roaring laughter from start to end . But of course as a comedy , one can't fault the script for trying to piece everything together , resulting in one crazy and messy approach . A huge leaf taken from the Will Smith vehicle Hitch forms the central premise , where a love guru dispenses advice to his clients to help them achieve their objectives , while at the same time finding trouble to practice what he is teaching . Louis Koo's Koo Chai is the Asian Hitch equivalent with some hypnotic powers , being paid by Ronald Cheng's Kei to help his sister Sandra ( Sandra Ng ) get married , so that he can break the family curse that befalls each of his fiancées . The principles of seduction get into full swing to charm the successful alpha-female with a zilch love life in routines that you can see coming from miles away . There are however , some excellent one-off scenes , and my personal favourites are the dining table identity crisis scene , as well as a gambling one involving Raymond Wong ( given top billing here although he appears only from the halfway mark ) , Lee Heung-Kam and Sandra's real life dad Ha Chun-Chau , the latter two being her on-screen parents . I guess the filmmakers were quite unsure whether new faces could carry the franchise , so they had to rely on the tried and tested veterans , though folks like Sandra seem to be playing yet another usual character seen in many of her movies . Ronald Cheng though is a personal revelation and has quite the rubber face . Don't go expecting plenty of hearty laughter , as the set pieces do look more juvenile rather than genuinely funny , and are more misses than hitting the mark .

108,"Text1: Alfred Hitchcock's the Lodger finds the master of suspense , at 27 , already with an instant knack at mounting suspense and dread , often with some startling camera movements , not to mention the moments of gallows humor . It's exhilarating to see Hitchcock , in a silent film no less , stage the implied murder of a woman by showing movement , shadow , a pause , then a seemingly over-the-top close-up of the woman screaming , then cutting to the next day or whatever . He makes a street corner look downright vicious and creepy , and I'm sure in the intended blue-tinted scenes it's something of a minor revelation on escalating the thriller of the period into art ( the version available on the most recent DVD , as an ' extra ' on the DVD of Sabotage , is acceptable at best and at worst is a travesty for collectors who might want the best musical score or digital treatment of a transfer ) . It's the classic story of Jack the Ripper , with certain names changed and a slight twist of a jealous romantic plot common to Hitchcock films - here he's called the "" Avenger - and it concerns a certain lodger who goes to stay for a bit at a house owned by Mr . and Mrs . Bunting . The lodger is a funny sort of chap , hating the pictures on the wall in his room , saying ominous throwaway words during a chess game , and going out in foggy London at night . The Bunting's daughter likes him , but her fiancée , a detective , is jealous and suspects the lodger to be the deadly Avenger , out killing blonds left and right . The story , despite seeming ( at least on the DVD ) to jump around a little bit in mid-scene , is executed with a level of narrative fluidity I was surprised by . Sometimes in silent films one gets so attracted to just the visual aspects of certain compositions or the star power of the leads that the story loses its way . Here Hitchcock balances the elements , and makes for some good details along the way . There are little things that stand out as interesting techniques or little notes in the storyline . I liked the editing style when we see a crowd gather around the corpse of one of the Avenger . I liked , a lot , seeing a figure walk across what seems like a staircase , but looking upward at him . And I loved seeing a little note of romance , as a character cuts out a little heart-shaped piece of dough and hands it to Daisy ( played by , simply named , ' June ' who is a beauty ) , coaxingly , but then when not accepted right away he rips it in two . A detail like that , or a line of dialog at the end cuing the audience to something "" you're toothbrush - you left it behind "" makes for a nice touch too . It doesn't hurt either that Ivor Novello makes for a perfectly ambiguous character - the sort you're not totally sure of , watching his every facial gesture like it's another clue , or another devilish intonation . Compared to some of Hitchcock's more beloved classics this is sometimes a little crude in its construction , as well having to be subverted to the sound form ( one wishes a little for the big personalities of Hitchcock's 1930s British films ) . But all things considered , it's essential viewing , and shows the kind of breakthrough work that Hitchcock needed ( i . e . a hit ) that could get the ball rolling on his career in England - and not as a fluke , to be sure .

Conway's capable direction , the tight script , spooky cinematography , several good jump-out-at-you startling jolts , a rousing conclusion , and the especially gnarly-looking squish-bodied , frog-faced , sharp-fanged titular ugly buggers make this a solid scarefest all the same . Moreover , the underground scenes have a truly creepy , clammy , and claustrophobic feel to them , grizzled character thesps John Crawford and Med Flory portray a couple of seasoned old pro mining hands with pleasingly crusty aplomb , and craggy-faced fuddy dud Jon Lormer has a colorful secondary role as a nutty old coot whose grave warnings about the mines are naturally ignored . Better still , the younger characters are surprisingly well-developed and genuinely likable . The winsomely perky'n'pretty Rebecca Balding , who also starred in the superior slasher item "" Silent Scream "" and was briefly touted as an apparent heir to the crown of then reigning scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis , in particular is most appealing as the spunky heroine ( and she takes her clothes off as well , which is an additional plus ) . Given all these strengths , it's no wonder that this funky favorite has acquired a small , yet loyal cult following .

Text2:  Five  is , I guess , the first "" post-nuke "" flick , in which we find a survivor wandering , looking for others , and she runs across a cabin where there are cups , and a fire , and then she finds the man that lives there . She's nursed back to health , and then , along comes a jeep with two more men in it , one black , one old . The old man may well be suffering from radiation poisoning & sleeps for days , but when he awakens he wants to go to the ocean , so everyone piles into the jeep & off they go , to find the fifth survivor , washed up on the shore . Things are not idyllic , for the final survivor , an explorer with a very odd accent , is rather a jerk & does not like the fact that the black man is treated as an equal ( remember , this is 1951 ) . The woman is pregnant but men being what they are , at least one has a go at her , but he doesn't get very far . The final survivor is also rather a trouble-maker , and convinces the woman to go with him to find her husband in the city , with dire results .

110,"Text1: This first Monogram Charlie Chan film is a little tougher to enjoy than the prior 20th Century Fox films . For one , Sidney Toler's depiction of Chan is more abrupt and almost mean spirited at times . Music is used more frequently , but seems out of place , as when a dramatic score is used when Chan casually strolls to a taxi . Offsetting these points is the introduction of two new members of the Chan Clan , the film now revealing there are fourteen ! offspring . Benson Fong joins the action as Number # 3 son Tommy , and Marianne Quon is introduced as Number # 2 daughter Iris . Mantan Moreland also joins the cast as Birmingham Brown , although his character has not been fully developed at this point . The mystery involves the murder of a World War II scientist and inventor who has developed plans for a new torpedo . The cast of suspects is a varied lot , and as Charlie closes in on the killer , the killer himself is murdered . Charlie uses a ruse to flush out the second murderer , but somehow it seems contrived , as there is nothing in the film to lead up to the second killer's identity . Other guests are built up to seem more suspicious , such as Paul Arranto , confined to a wheelchair but who can actually walk . It's as if one of Charlie's own lines in the film can be used to describe the solution - "" Explanation too perfect to be true "" .

Text2: The summary line above , spoken by James Cloud ( Robert Preston ) to his brother Tom ( Robert Sterling ) just about says it all . Jim , AKA Kid Wichita , has a way of making things happen , only trouble is , he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been . Not the sort of mentoring Tom envisions for younger brother Jeff , who likes what he sees in Jim , especially when defending their ranch against local Texas cattlemen . The opening credits state ' Introducing John Barrymore Jr . as the Younger Brother ' , in this his very first screen appearance . That seemed rather odd to me , particularly since he was addressed as Jeff almost immediately into the story . Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie , he bears a passing resemblance to Sean Penn . No stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family , I was left wondering if his daughter Drew Barrymore might have ever seen this picture . I'm inclined to think not . On the subject of resemblances , I was also struck by the thought that the young Robert Sterling looked a bit like Roy Rogers early in his career . Knowing Sterling previously only from his role as George Kerby in the early 1950's TV series ' Topper ' , I thought he looked out of place in a Western , but that might just be me . His character becomes emboldened by his brother's resourcefulness at creating trouble , and provides some of the edginess to this not so typical story . Minor subplots abound , including the relationship rancher John Gall ( John Litel ) has with his son the Sheriff ( who Kid Wichita kills ) , and the troubled marriage between Kathleen Boyce ( Cathy Downs ) and her husband Earl ( who Kid Wichita kills ) . Chill Wills rounds out the main cast as one of Tom Cloud's hired hands , and figures in the somewhat predictable finale . What's not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there , and for that reason , this Western earns points for following a less traveled , hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brother / bad brother Westerns do . Combined with the eclectic casting of the principals , it's one I'd recommend , even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that I experienced with my copy .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

112,"Text1: The third movie produced by the production company "" Dark Castle "" and managed by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis , "" Ghost Ship "" ( 2002 ) marks a step forward and constitutes a neat improvement in comparison with the two previous movies , "" the House on the Haunted Hill "" ( 1999 ) and "" 13 Ghosts "" ( 2001 ) . This can be checked at the level of a meticulous making and quite outstanding special effects . It is all the more positive as with "" Ghost Ship "" , we deal with a B movie . Another good point : the change of scenery . It is a judicious choice to have replaced the threadbare topic of the haunted house by the haunted ship . If the screenplay doesn't avoid all the Hollywood conventions , neither all the clichés of the horror film , the director Steve Beck makes up for it by shrouding his movie an atmosphere of mystery as soon as the crew discovers the ship . He's also imposing ( slowly but surely ) a progressive rise of the tension which reaches its climax in the end . The result : we come in for a few real moments of fright and Beck , in the long run puts the spectator in his pocket . As far as the cast is concerned , there are two surprises . First : Julianna Margulies who for once decided to give up scalpels in the "" ER "" series and especially Gabriel Byrne . An ambitious actor who isn't reluctant to sometimes act in a horror movie which is potboiler for him like "" End of Days "" ( 1999 ) or "" Stigmata "" ( 1999 ) . It is a shame that the end isn't really satisfying and suits badly to the whole . But no matter , "" Ghost Ship "" remains a nice little horror movie whose main function is to make shiver . For this , it reaches its goal . One last thing , if the movies that come out of the "" Dark Castle "" production company keep on gaining in quality , maybe will they create a masterpiece one day . . .

Text2: THREE TIMES ( Zui hao de shi guang ) is so frank a film that the viewer may get lost looking for the hidden meanings in this century traversal of lovers ' interactions in China . Not one for simple linear film-making , director Hsiao-hsien Hou instead opts for mood and suggestion and leaves the paucity of dialog to make room for emotional involvement and response . Three periods - 1966 A Time for Love , 1911 A Time for Freedom , and 2005 A Time for Youth - are depicted with the same main characters , Qi Shu and Chen Chang , who prove to be exceptionally sensitive to the concept from the director : with each new tale these fine actors mold new characters and questions and yet allow us to see a line of similarity in the couples as the director has suggested . The film wisely opens with the most successful of the three ' Times ' - 1966 A Time for Love - - tracing the emergence of timid passion between a lad headed for the military and a young girl who works in a pool hall . They communicate by letters after their first brief introductory encounter and circumstances interfere with the progress of their relationship in 1966 Taiwan . The middle section 1911 A Time for Freedom is gorgeous visually and conceptually the director has elected to use the cinematic form of the period ( silent movie ) to tell his story about the freeing of a young girl from the grip of a brothel madam and surveys the political tensions between Japan and China as the quietly lighted story of love and yearning unfolds . The film ends with 2005 A Time for Youth and here our lovers are caught up in the pollution of smog , cellphones , emails , nightclubs , and infidelities for same sex affairs that speak loudly about the tenor of the times . Hsiao-hsien Hou's films are an acquired taste and many will find the choppy editing , the fragmentary scenes that are not always well focused for the story line , and the over-long length ( 130 minutes ) too much to endure . But the ideas are fresh and the characters and vignettes are memorable , and most of the major critics in the media have lavished praise on this film . It is an interesting work but for this viewer there are enough flaws to keep it grounded . Grady Harp","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Now , 12 long years later , I've finally had the opportunity to see the film from which Gilliam's inspiration came , and I have to say that I was not overly impressed , although it is interesting . This is a 28 minute film using only static images , that tells a tale of a devastated world where people now live underground , and after some botched experiments with lesser test-subjects , a scientist finally finds a man whose memories are strong enough to be able to move to another place in time , which is the past . The man's memory is of a day at Orly Aiport where he saw something disturbing that stayed with him for many years , but he also sees a woman there who was at the far end of the observation deck and somehow becomes close to her . By way of this "" time travel "" ( which in this film seems only mental , not physical ) , the man is eventually able to procure something to help his people , etc . , but then finds his usefulness is over and he's time-traveled back to the place that he remembers best , only to have been followed by his executor . This is a rather haunting piece but after all I've heard about it I suppose that I really expected more . Maybe it would have been better had I seen this first ( before 12 Monkeys ) so that my viewing experience wasn't clouded by thoughts of that film while watching this one . .

We know he's ' evil ' from the get go because he smokes ( the horror , the horror ) .

121,"Text1: George Lucas will , of course , always be remembered for his masterpiece ; the Star Wars series , and for good reason ; as he hasn't done much else . While American Graffiti was a nice non-Star Wars film for the man , this one ; THX-1138 certainly isn't . For a man who made such a big impact on the Sci-Fi / Fantasy genres with Star Wars , you would expect his first foray into those territories to be at least an acceptable film ; but this isn't . Plodding along with an astute dullness , it's hard to be left anything but cold by this film . It's obvious that Lucas wanted to throw in as much Sci-Fi as possible into the film , and this has resulted in the movie resembling a mish-mash of science fiction orientated sequences , which comes very much at the expense of the story . The thin plot follows two people , living in the distant future where sex and love in general have been banned , who have found themselves in jail for breaking the laws of the place they live in . They then decide to breakout with the help of some guy they meet in there . Lucas has seen fit to give the film a style similar to that of Sci-Fi masterpiece 2001 : A Space Odyssey and this style-stealing is somewhat ironic considering that this is the same man that would go on to revitalise the genre six years later with his masterpiece . The people in the film all sport white uniforms and shaved heads and while this enables Lucas to present a regimented vision of the future that compliments the plot and style of the movie , it also means that none of the actors stand out , and since all of them , even the great Robert Duvall and the normally solid Donald Pleasance , find themselves with not a lot to do ; it can't be said that this is an actor's movie . The way that the plot meanders and never really allows the audience the plug into it , is the film's major downfall . Unlike Star Wars , which relied on storytelling to be a success ; this movie relies more on atmosphere and visuals and while Lucas can do these things , he's far too set on doing them and this kills the movie . The same thing happened with the first two Star Wars prequels . Overall - a major disappointment !

I like him , he's very handsome and has a great voice - - not a bad actor either . It's just that his character was so unpleasant in this movie that it got annoying to watch . Shirley Jones ' character was a problem too - - way too sweet . I wondered more than once why she loved the guy and didn't just divorce him . So basically , I didn't like or respect the two main characters . Still , the songs were fantastic ( especially "" You'll Never Walk Alone "" ) and the choreography during "" June is Bursting Out All Over "" was staggering . So , worth seeing for the songs and dancing - - ignore the story and characterizations . Also , see it letter-boxed , it doesn't work otherwise !

Text2: Cassidy ( Tyler Hanes ) and his younger sister Jessica ( James Katharine Flynn ) are in the same university . Cassidy is also gay but not out to anyone . He sees a Latino hustler named Victor ( Carlos Alberto Valencia ) and starts having visions of his sister Jessica covered in blood . He realizes he has to reconcile his gay identity to discover what the visions mean . Sounds confusing doesn't it ? It's not a bad movie . It's well directed and shot . There's also some good acting by Flynn , Valencia and Robert Dionne and some hot guys with their clothes off once in a while . However the plot gets muddy and increasingly sillier as the movie goes on . Also there are TERRIBLE performances by Alison Faser and Maria Bova . Worst of all it has a homophobic ending and Hanes is REALLY bad in his role . He's supposed to be a popular guy but he comes across as ugly , obnoxious , controlling and WAY too protective of his sister . I also find it hard to believe that any college student in this day and age ( especially one enrolled in a college in NYC ) would have trouble coming out . This movie does have its moments ( the sex scene between Hanes and Valencia is a highlight ) but the lousy ending and a REAL pointless last shot destroy this .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: This is one of the most terrifying films I have seen in years , and what's great about it is that it's a work by one of the greatest cinema directors , Sir Alfred Hitchcock . The story is that Melanie Daniels ( introducing Golden Globe nominated Tippi Hedren ) meets Mitch Brenner ( Rod Taylor ) in a bird shop where is trying to buy love birds for his little sister's birthday . So Melanie decides to take some to him herself . Suddenly before returning to shore after delivering the birds she is attacked . Not long after birds start to attack many other innocent people , until finally the entire town of Bodega Bay is overrun by these horrifying birds . A gripping story with some blood involved and some very good effects . Hitchcock himself said that this is probably his most terrifying film ever ! Also starring Driving Miss Daisy's Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner , Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth , Alien's Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner , and Hitchcock's cameo is the man leaving the pet shop with two white Sealyham terriers past Hedren . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Special Visual Effects . Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , the film was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments , and it was number 7 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills .

The plotlines are different but still share some similarities , as they both involve revenge from beyond the grave , rich families with hidden secrets , a murder investigation carried out on behalf of the murdered man himself , etc .

125,"Text1: Here's a perfectly creepy little bump in the night flick that should appeal to most fans of the decapitated head genre . One's first thought if you've been around the block with these films is "" The Brain That Wouldn't Die "" , and the plot of both appear remarkably similar . "" The Head "" is certainly more atmospheric and brooding , no doubt owing to it's German origins , while ' Brain ' has a much more camp flavor . Which leads me to consider that if the star of ' Brain ' was Jan in the Pan , this one features what you might call Abel on the Table . Here's something a bit odd , the opening scene has the picture's protagonist Dr . Ood ( Horst Frank ) slinking around in the shadows of Dr . Abel's laboratory home , and he stops to pick up a turtle walking on the pavement ! Where in the world did that come from ? Very strange , and I kept looking for that turtle the rest of the way , but he never showed up . I wonder why the film makers decided the story needed a one hundred seventeen day interlude before Irene Sanders ( Karin Kernke ) came out of her coma with a new body . On screen , it played out like she awoke the very next day after the operation . Ood's explanation had to do with reshaping her organs and a lot of other such nonsense , when all he did was take stripper Lilly's body for the experiment . At least they came up with some kind of explanation for the missing stripper , but gee , throwing her under a train was kind of gruesome , don't you think ? Anyway with all that said , you should have some fun with this one , even if it's played much more seriously than it needs to be . It's just the ticket for the proverbial dark and stormy night , huddled up on the couch with all the lights off . The picture provides all the remaining atmosphere you'll need .

Text2: It appears a little more thought than usual went into this Lone Star Western , as the story line is fairly consistent and director Robert North Bradbury throws in a few elements I haven't seen yet after watching almost all of them . Wayne's character is Ted Hayden , who takes on the guise of wanted murderer Gat Ganns when it might help him get the goods on bad guy Gentry ( Lloyd Whitlock ) . George Hayes , not yet known as Gabby , teams up with Wayne to outwit the baddies and save the day for the Winters ( Lafe McKee and Virginia Faire Brown ) . It struck me that Wayne's appearance in the film bears some resemblance to another cowboy star , Hopalong Cassidy . His character wears all black , including the tall cowboy hat , and he rides a white horse in the story . Of course , Hoppy teamed with Gabby to round out that connection as well . The story itself is fairly formulaic , bad guy Gentry wants the Winters ranch and they aren't selling . Stealing their money and their cattle , and getting rid of Mr . Winters all sounds pretty familiar , with Gentry hiring the phony Ganns to help pull it off . Then he plans to eliminate Ganns as well , by killing him and claiming the reward money . Needless to say , the good guys figure it all out , and the payoff is a beaut . As Gentry staggers out of a cabin following a fight with Hayden , his own men gun him down by mistake - OOPS ! Yakima Canutt performs some of the daring stunts he's known for , one involves bringing two buckboard horses to a halt after they've broken away from their rig , with Yak riding the hitch like a pair of water skis . There's a wilder one though , when as Hayden , he dives off his horse and through the window of a cabin in pursuit of Gentry . It's one of the better stunts you'll see Yak perform in this or any movie . Typically , John Wayne gets the girl at the end of the picture , but it's not surprising . Earlier in the story , his character Hayden remarks to Gentry - "" . . . I'll stay at the Winters place tonight , I got a few things I want to pick up "" . The difference this time out though , the film doesn't end in a clinch between the new couple . Instead , they chase down young Jim Hayden after he embarrasses big brother and Fay into a match up . For trivia fans , you might want to keep that ' Wanted ' poster for Gat Ganns in mind if you look up some more of Wayne's Lone Star films . It appears again tacked to a cabin wall in a scene from "" The Trail Beyond "" . Even in the Thirties they found ways to economize .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Jimenen lets Jay taste a sample of his specially formulated honey which he becomes instantly addicted to , sensing an opportunity to make money Jay blackmails Jimenen to let him sell it . Then a few weeks later a woman show's up in Jimenen's apartment , a woman with an unusual secret , a woman who is Jimenen's very own queen . . . Episode three from season one of Monsters this originally aired in the US during November 1988 , directed by Jerry Smith I quite liked this rather bizarre story although I would expect a lot of people might find it just too silly . The script goes mostly for laughs as the over the top character's , silly situations & dialogue is there for all to see . Then just when you think it can't get any more daft it throws a memorable but utterly bonkers twist ending at you which for me makes New York Honey quite entertaining in a totally off the wall sort of way . I certainly didn't expect the twist & I doubt many will so in that regard it has the potential to surprise , it's just a shame that it comes across as almost like a spoof of 50's ' mad doctor / scientist creates giant monster / bug ' type films which clearly wasn't the makers intention but doesn't really do the episode any harm as a whole since it is generally quite light hearted . At only twenty or so minutes long at least it's short enough not to drag or outstay it's welcome & while not the best piece of telly ever I did enjoy it for what it was although I did feel a little bit guilty that I did ! With the budget so tight on the show once again there are only two sets & only four actor's in it . There's a sort of bizarre twisted sitcom feel about New York Honey that I liked too . The special effects are alright although the final giant Bee monster at the end does look a bit naff but the transformation scenes from human to Bee monster by comparison look pretty good . Most Monsters episodes go for scares & are fairly serious in tone but New York Honey is definite an exception as it has a spoofy feel to it . The acting is way over the top with the cast members pulling silly faces every five seconds & exaggerating their lines & performance in general . New York Honey is an undeniably silly & light hearted episode of Monsters that I actually thought was pretty good although I probably shouldn't have . The bizarre plot , the memorable twist & one or two amusing moments make this well worth a watch if you can catch it on telly for free .

Potential lovers Billy ( Tom Nagel ) & Gretchin ( Heather Conforto ) have an argument & Gretchin drives off on her own , however her car breaks down a short time later & while stuck in the middle of nowhere she is attacked by a Werewolf like creature & brutally killed . . . It's not long before soon to be the new Sheriff Phil Jenkins ( Jeff Denton ) has found Gretchins abandoned car & starts to investigate , as he tries to find the whereabouts of Gretchin he is told of the local legends about the supposed ' Beast of Bray Road ' which has apparently stalked the area for years . At first Jenkins is understandably sceptical but as the bodies start to pile up & a flood of ' Beast ' sightings are reported he might have to rethink his position & break out the silver bullets . . . Apparently ' Based on a True Story ' ( according to the opening credits ) , edited , written & directed by Leigh Slawner I thought The Beast of Bray Road was a pretty decent little horror film , it's nothing spectacular but it's certainly watchable in it's own right . The script moves along at a fair pace & it's not overly boring or talky . The film keeps the Werewolf's identity a secret until the end & the actual revelation as to whom it is comes across as a neat little twist that isn't as obvious as it might have been . There are pleasing amounts of violence & there's some nice nudity as well . I thought the character's were a bit poor , lots of small town small minded bigot's who hate the police & get drunk all the time . Still , nothings perfect right ? The Beast of Bray Road isn't the best horror film ever made but it's a pretty decent time-waster all the same & there aren't too many Werewolf films out there , let alone good ones . I'm not sure what else I can say about it , it's a perfectly watchable film & that's about all that need to be said really . Director Slawner does a pretty good job , the film looks quite good & isn't as cheap looking as a lot of low budget horror films . There isn't many scares & there's not much atmosphere either but there's some nice gore , there are crushed heads , split open heads , decapitated heads , someone has their leg torn off , there are various unfortunate people who have their intestines pulled out & eaten , there's a gory blood splattered skeleton , bodies ripped in half & there's a lot of blood splashed around which helps . There's some nudity as well . The special effects are good as well & there isn't a rubbishy cartoon CGI effect in sight , the Werewolf creature looks decent although we never see any sort of transformation scene & unlike a lot of Werewolf films whether it appears or not seems to have nothing to do with there being a full moon or not . Technically The Beast of Bray Road is fine & considering it's low budget shot on a digital camcorder type origins it's pretty good . The acting was also fairly good . The Beast of Bray Road is one of those films which is watchable , it isn't going to top anyones ' best film ' list but it's a good Werewolf horror film with a decent amount of gore . You could do better for sure but you could also do a hell of a lot worse , worth a watch if nothing else .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
127,"Text1: SPOILERS Having been dead and buried for some 90 years this group of pre-teenage miners have come back to life to exact revenge on the person , or his descendants , who was responsible for their deaths : The late 19th and early 20th Century coal mine tycoon Eban Carlton . Carlton had a habit of using children of dirt poor miners who worked at his dilapidated mine-shafts to get into the nooks and crannies that full grown miners wouldn't as much as touch . On top of all that Carlton paid the children slave wages , with no health benefits , for the very dangerous work that he expected from them . What really blew the Carlton coal mining empire to holy hell was a major mine accident that ended up killing dozens of minor , under 13 , miners back in 1913 that just about put an end to his career in the coal mining business . One of those unfortunate young miners , or minor , who was killed in the mine explosion was 10 year-old Mary Tunny who's body as never found . As it turned Mary's descendent's , on her fathers side , ended up inheriting the Tunny home where the deadly Carlton mine was once located at ! It's when the widowed Karen Tunny and her two daughters Sarah and young Emma moved into their late father's and Karen's husbands house that all hell started to beak lose . For some reason a bunch of teenage , or pre-teenage , zombie miners came to life going out at night attacking and eating the local residents . It's obvious from the films prologue that these zombies are the dead children who were killed in the 1913 mineshaft explosion . The movie gets very confusing , and hard on the eyes , due to its lack of providing its audience proper lighting where most of the action on the screen comes across as if it takes place in a mineshaft with the only light available being that on a miners flashlight helmet . We also get this zonked out religious fanatic Aaron Hanks who's constantly quoting the Bible , the Old and New Testament , and acting or thinking that he's the late Charlton Heston playing the part of Moses in the film "" The Ten Commandants "" ! Hanks even goes so far in him imitating "" Chuck "" Heston , as Moses , in him insisting that the Tunny's smear blood , any blood would do , on their doorpost in order to avoid the Zombies from entering their house and having them for dinner . This was like Moses having the Israelites doing the very same thing to prevent the evil spirit or "" Angel of Death "" from killing their first born as written in the book of Exodus . By far the most confusing , and ridicules , sequence in the film had to do with Sarah going out to get groceries and then getting involved with a bunch of local spaced out teenagers who pass the joint , as well as downing a couple six packs of beer , around for entertainment . Sarah's new found friends tell her all about these zombies , who seemed to have be around and active for decades , but at the same time are not that interested in avoiding them ! The beer guzzling pot smoking teens thus end up , with the exception of Sarah , being the zombies main course dinner . SPOILERS It became evident , from the moment he came on the scene , that it was William Carlton , the great grandson of the late coal mine tycoon Eban , who the zombies were really after . William a first class jerk who treated everyone in the area like dirt , or coal dust , wanted to buy up everything around the old Tunny House turning it into a multi-million dollar ski resort . It may well have been William's arrogant and brainless , in that he should have known better , actions that brought the dead , the zombies , back to life . Instead of letting the dead stay dead William by planning to dig up their graves , in the long sealed up mineshaft under the Tunny House , was what really got them pied them off . The outraged zombies in being awakened from their long deserved sleep soon let William know what they thought about him and his future plans-in no uncertain terms-at the conclusion of the movie !

128,"Text1: As of this writing , Glenn Ford is still with us , living in retirement . He has never , except from his fans and fellow actors , received the recognition his honest acting abilities in drama or comedy have fully deserved . His performances in "" Experiment In Terror "" and "" The Blackboard Jungle "" and "" 3 : 10 To Yuma "" fully show his firm handling of dramatic material . He was a superb psychotic villain in "" The Man From Colorado "" . He held his own with Rita Hayworth and George Macready in "" Gilda "" . And for comic gems let me suggest "" The Rounders "" ( holding his own with Henry 0Fonda , Chill Wills , and his old film friend Edgar Buchanan ) , "" Teahouse Of The August Moon "" , and this film . For some reason the New York Times film critics always slam "" The Gazebo "" . I can't tell why . It may be because those comedies traipsing on dark matters like murder seem to need an element of elegance ( in some quarters ) to be rated highly . But how many "" Kind Hearts And Coronets "" or "" Monsieur Verdoux "" films can there be ? THE GAZEBO is certainly bereft of elegant villains like Dennis Price and Charlie Chaplin , but it does draw us into the hero's real problems . Elliot Nash ( Ford ) is a hard-working producer , whose wife Nell ( Debbie Reynolds ) is an equally hard worker performer . Nash has been receiving blackmail threats from a man he has never met . The man is demanding an impossibly large sum of money for pictures he has of Nell that might hurt her career . Nash is forced , in his bumbling way , to consider the only alternative ( short of a miracle ) to take care of the blackmailer : he must kill him . So on a night that Nell is away from their suburban home , Nash ( following a step-by-step plan he even wrote down and put into his desk's top draw ) arranges to shoot and kill the blackmailer and to bury the body . He had originally intended to simply bury it in the back yard , but Nell has accidentally helped him here - it seems ( for his birthday gift ) she is installing an antique gazebo in the backyard , under the watchful workmanship of John McGiver . Ford drags the dead body ( in an old bath curtain ) into the backyard , and puts it into the foundation of the gazebo . The problems arise afterward . First , it turns out the police want to question him anyway regarding the blackmailer - it seems they found his body in his office , shot to death . They don't suspect Nash for this , but they are curious about why the blackmailer called him . Of course this leads to the issue - who is in the gazebo . Ford goes nuts trying to figure out who among his family and friends is missing . Secondly , it also brings up another matter . Elliot and Nell have a close friend , Harlowe ( Carl Reiner ) , whom Elliot has always found a little annoying as Harlowe once was dating Nell . Now he's around prying into the relationship of Elliot and the dead blackmailer . Soon some others pop up , two goons ( the leader is Martin Landau ) wondering what happened to Dan - whom they knew was supposed to be visiting Elliot . Can he be the man in the gazebo ? Is he the key to all this ? The action of the jittery Ford is priceless , particularly in the scene where he shoots the visitor . An example : Nash has been thinking of doing some work with Alfred Hitchcock . Hitch calls ( we never see or hear him ) while Nash is wondering how to bury the dead man . Ford asks Hitch advise "" for a plot he's working on "" and Hitch helps out . The final ten minutes , when Ford is almost ready to throw himself on the mercy of the detectives ( Reiner and Bert Freed , as a Lieutenant who literally louses up his own case ) , only to change strategies in a moment of clarity , are hysterical . I particularly hope you fully appreciate Freed's tag-line at the conclusion of the film .

Text2: Lurid vampire film , set within a seedy part of London where night feeders feast on the blood of prostitutes . Well two , in particular , both bitten by a mysterious woman , never named ( . . and whose face is never shown ) . One is Vincent Monroe ( Giles Alderson ) , a night feeder who waxes existential about how the addiction for blood is akin to a heroine junkie's need for the next fix . He falls in love with a tough-talking , street-wise exotic dancer , Ruby ( Katia Winter , who smolders on screen ) for whom he bites , and turns , into a feeder . Ruby is haunted by the nightmarish childhood where memories of her heroine-addicted father ( . . seen at the opening as we view his puss-oozing arm , infected by the ugly needles ) who would commit suicide in the next room . Ruby is being groomed as the top stripper of a club magnate , Max ( Jonathan Coyne ) , a bald vicious sort , in tailor-made suits who "" protects "" the female investments under his employ . The lucrative prostitution ring he runs in his stripping establishment is ran under Max's iron fist and , along with his muscle ( Daniel Kobbina ) , persuades his girls to participate in keeping the business a success . Ruby is continuously pressured by Max to take her position as a dancer one step further by making more money having sex with clients . Soon Ruby will attempt to leave her boss with Vincent working as her avenger . . but a Jack-the-Ripper type psychopath ( René Zagger ) , under Max's employ , also a feeder ( . . the other male turned by the mysterious female who seems to meet men she picks up at bars with the sole intent on spreading her "" sickness "" to others ) has a fixation with Ruby and will seek revenge for what Vincent does to his boss , as well as to settle a score with the one who denounced his advances . This psycho is the actual one feasting on his boss ' employees . I commend the effort of director Lawrence Pearce whose obviously working with a rather low budget . . it really shows because he shoots most of the film at night , with characters shot in darkened rooms and streets . Set in London , the director opts to show very little of the characteristics associated with the city , probably due to financial woes than choice . Yes , he does use modern techniques , but the director seems intent on keeping this "" vampire "" tale story-driven , even if the setting is riddled with foul characters and ugly circumstances . London , in this film , is portrayed as a nasty world replete with loathsome people . The title is quite appropriate . . this views vampirism as an addiction with the need to feed insatiable , always there yearning for blood as the body desires oxygen . We are privy to Vincent's methods in how he selects and disposes with his victims . He tries to be selective , but there are times where he must not be choosy . He informs Ruby as they stroll a bridge that over the edge is his "" . . cute little community which rests at the bottom of the Thames . "" Ruby finds this repulsive , but Vincent believes he's doing them the community a service , if he left the bodies he fed from lying dead , "" . . it'd be like a user dumping needles on the street . "" This film is very talky with Vincent narratively explaining the burden of his addiction . At the forefront is this tragic love story between two lost souls trying to make a pact against feeding , but fighting the craving for blood ( . . along with the psycho searching for them and his climactic confrontation ) will test their bond . Not a bad little movie , I rather liked it . But , the film is drenched in unpleasantness ( the sleazy nature of Max's business is exploited ; René Zagger's sadistic psycho beats a drunken hooker across the face in a rage , lapping up the blood on her face like a starving mutt ) , so it's not for all tastes ( . . pun intended ) . Many might feel that René Zagger is a bit too over-the-top . . he certainly seems to be enjoying himself , relishing his violent behavior theatrically .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
131,"Text1: POSTER BOY is a film with a lot of potential : the story premise is solid ( though a bit tired ) , the cast of both young and experienced actors is quite fine , and there are some worthwhile statements about our political system , about tolerance and acceptance and family , and about being true to yourself . Despite all of these aspects that should have made a fine little film the whole thing bogs down with some of the worst editing and camera work on record . That , and the writers ' ( Lecia Rosenthal and Ryan Shiraki ) need to place platitudes into normal conversation is most distracting . Zak Tucker as director just didn't seem to have control of this piece . The story itself is rather simple . Through the gimmick of a confession to a reporter we meet handsome young Henry Kray ( the talented Matt Newton ) , gay since early teens but electing to keep his private life a secret , who is the son of Senator Jack Kray ( Michael Lerner ) and his lovely but docile wife Eunice ( the fine Karen Allen ) . It seems that six months prior to the time we are invited into the conversation Henry met Anthony ( hunky Jack Noseworthy ) whose roommate is HIV positive Izzie ( Valerie Geffner ) . Henry and Anthony have a one-night stand the day before Jack Kray is to give a speech for re-election at Henry's college . The Senator accidentally hits Izzie with his car and Eunice insists Izzie stay with them in their suite where the two women bond . Meanwhile Henry's night with Anthony makes him late for the speech , but a talk to Henry from Jack before the speech telling him what to say ( Jack is the best father , loves family values , etc ) sticks in Henry's throat and soon after he obeys his father's wishes for the speech introduction , Henry turns to his table partner Anthony and the two kiss openly as the Senator is addressing the crowd - all caught by the media of course . How this moment of honesty alters the lives of everyone around is the crux of the ending . Not a bad tale , but the camera work is so patchy and disconcertingly disconnected that it defies the viewer to keep the storyline straight . But if the viewer can keep up visually , the performances by the cast are well worth attention . There is some very fine talent on the screen of this B movie ! Grady Harp

Text2: Clifford Irving ( Fake , Trial , Final Argument , The Spring ) became a sort of national hero when he contrived to publish ' The Autobiography of Howard Hughes ' , a 400 page phony but well researched book that , while it was never published , did cause enough of a stir among the New York publishing cognoscenti and those surrounding the then President Richard Nixon that it now is recognized as a HOAX of writing that triggered the final discovery of the Watergate Scandal and the subsequent dethroning of Nixon . Those facts alone make this sometimes rather tepid film interesting enough to sit through . Screenwriter William Wheeler has adapted Irving's book into a study of the 1970s and Lasse Hallström gives it just the right balance between soft crime and strange comedy to keep it afloat . Clifford Irving ( Richard Gere ) is down on his literary luck , searching for the right kind of story that will set is publisher Andrea Tate ( Hope Davis ) on fire . Irving wife Edith ( Marcia Gay Harden ) is an active painter and doesn't give Irving the support he gets from his pal Dick Suskind ( Alfred Molina ) , but on the messy floor of Edith's studio is a rag magazine with a cover picture of the mysterious Howard Hughes and bingo ! up comes the idea for an ' autobiography ' of the wizard as confided to Irving and researched by Suskind . That is really the plot then , how these two men squirm around lies and good luck to forge papers and gain the favor of the publishers . Of course it all caves in , but in the publicity about the book Nixon's secrets are revealed and the rest is history . Gere , Molina , Harden , Davis , Stanley Tucci , Julie Delphy and Eli Wallach add immeasurably to the success of the film . No , it is not a heavy story , but the scandalous years of the 1970s are treated realistically and provide a lot of memories , both good and bad , about how we all changed in that post Vietnam time .

"" Les otages "" which career was stopped by WW2 is far from being as strong . In 1938 , a lot of movies were verging on propaganda , and "" les otages "" was part of them . Okay , two people fighting for a tiny piece of land ( and their children get married unbeknown to one of them at that ) may be a subtle metaphor for the impending events . But the treatment fluctuates between comedy and tragedy and with the exception of one or two sequences - the soon-to-be - executed man singing to the toddler "" les petites marionettes "" behind the bars - , I doubt it will grab today's audience . Everybody vying to be an hostage-the German demands five hostages because of one of their officer's death - , it's hard to swallow . Just compare it to Christian - Jaque's "" le repas des fauves "" ( 1964 ) . There's also the famous episode of the taxis de la Marne , the deus ex machina of the movie . Considering what Renoir , Carné , Duvivier and Gance were doing at the same time , "" les otages "" , where everybody's a hero , is nothing but a propaganda movie .

Now I was born in ' 85 so I kinda missed out on these things , but I understand it's importance . I just bought this movie yesterday , it was back to back with Footloose , two iconic 80's movies , and I watched Flashdance this afternoon . While this film defined a huge part of the 80's , it was an average film with a simple plot . The acting and story is just pretty average , but it's a cute and fun one . Alex is a welder by day , but at night she is a sexy exotic dancer who grabs the attention of all the men . But she has big time dreams to become a ballet dancer , she has promised her grandmother that she would apply to the top ballet school and try to get an audition . But Alex is always intimidated by the other "" proper looking "" dancers with tons more experience than her . She falls in love with a fellow co-worker , Nick , who wants her to make it just as badly . She goes through rough times , but she just wants to make it and will do anything for that chance . Flashdance is one of those must see movies if you wanna see the important films of the 80's . I just wanted to see what this movie was about since it's such a huge part of film culture . Jennifer Beals actually did a great job as Alex , she was absolutely beautiful and made the character very likable . While this film did not live up to my expectations , it still was a good film . It has an awesome sound track and really is a lot of fun to dance too . Now excuse me , but I wanna try to take my bra off without removing my shirt , lol .

He takes the gorgeous day outside , takes his really sick best friend and his girlfriend and goes into beautiful Chicago for a blast of good times .

It was because you loved the pain you felt when he beat you up . That's why you're looking for him so hard , isn't it ? Director Takashi Miike has given us a film that is like nothing I have ever seen . I thought I had seen some horror , but this is the ultimate that I have experienced .

With Linda Hamilton in the credits it was worth a try for the buck I laid out , even though messing with the Kong legend is always risky business . Equal parts camp and cheese , the film has it's occasional high spots amid the generally ranging low ones . I got a kick out of an early scene when Brian Kerwin's character Mitchell uses the ' Can you hear me now ' line some dozen years or so before those annoying Verizon commercials made it a household slogan . The sit up and take notice scene had to be that enormous artificial heart that was going to be placed in the chest of the Kong that survived the fall from the World Trade Center in the 1976 film . Complete with footage of Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange from that less than successful remake , this film continues on to give new meaning to the term monkeyshines . When King and Lady Kong see each other for the first time , their exchange of glances is worthy of the most ambitious ' Saturday Night Live ' skit . So where does the King take his bride on their wedding night ? - why Honeymoon Ridge of course . How was he to know she was afraid of snakes ?

Text2: The first time I EVER heard about Davey Jones ' locker I was probably about eight years old and read about it in a ' Mighty Mouse ' comic book back in the 1950's - I still remember the panel ! The story never really made it clear about the legend , so I sit here almost fifty years later thinking about that story and the film I saw today . Whether the movie version bears any resemblance to the actual legend I still don't know , but it made for a good flick , and a worthy sequel to the original "" Pirates of the Caribbean "" . The pace of the story is pretty quick , and I'll admit that repeat viewings are necessary to catch the nuance between all the characters and events going on in an effort to retrieve the ' Dead Man's Chest ' . The nutshell version says that the owner of the chest and the beating heart of Davey Jones inside will rule the high seas . Besides good old Davey himself , there's an entire boatload of characters setting their sights on the mythical treasure . The first appearance of Johnny Depp as ambiguous swashbuckler ( swishbuckler ? ) Jack Sparrow was quite clever utilizing the painted eyelid gimmick . The cannibal get away scene by shish-kebob Jack gives new meaning to the term fruity pirate . I couldn't help making comparisons to the frenetic pacing of an old time Warner Brothers cartoon with a number of scenes in the picture , and I think that was a positive for the movie . This is the type of picture one views strictly for entertainment value and on that score I was not disappointed . No need to go into any more detail . With only six days under it's belt at the time of this posting , the movie is setting all kinds of records and has already elicited over eight hundred comments in this forum .

In one instance , there are three people singing and their voices all coming out separately on different speakers . Pretty good for just the tape . Now that a DVD has been released , I wonder what the sound on that is like ? The story starts to lag a bit near the end when Kaye starts to feel sorry for himself and this goes on and on as he retires from playing . However , there is a nice , sentimental upbeat ending . Notes : Kaye and Barbara Bel Geddes , who plays Red's wife "" Bobbie , "" never age in the film even though it spans 15 or more years ! It's interesting to see Tuesday Weld as a teenager .

However , Moreland is a likable guy so it's hard to get annoyed at his silliness .

The fights are different here too , as in this film we do not have the 15 round beat downs of the first films , but rather three rounds of pure hard hitting . In this one we start out with a strange charity match as Rocky the heavyweight champion of boxing goes against the heavyweight champion of wrestling , Thunderlipps ( Hulk Hogan in his only decent appearance in a movie , then again it is not really a stretch ) . This match is rather entertaining and funny , but soon Rocky must face a new challenger to his belt , the very tough Clubber Lang played by a very tough Mr . T . Mickey does not want Rocky to fight this guy as Mickey has seen that Rocky has lost the fire in his eyes that got him the title and would most likely lose to this determined if a bit arrogant new fighter . Well they do end up fighting and Rocky loses and gets hit even worse by the passing of his mentor . Apollo having witnessed the fight and not liking Clubber Lang at all offers to help Rocky train and thus a new friendship is born . The training is nice to watch and I like how Rocky does different strategies against Clubber in the final fight .

Text2: A direct reverse of the original , this sequel is a comedy ( albeit a twisted one ) masquerading as a horror film . There's never really a moment where you experience true horror . This film , thanks to a much larger budget , is too polished to get under the skin ( . . unless you are easily offended by cannibal jokes ) . I don't recall one genuine moment that haunts you or even scare you . Despite what happens to heroine Williams , you never feel like she'll not survive .

It's Williams who gets the camera time . . well , her and Leatherface ( . . which can be a good and bad thing ) . Leatherface has all the aura of terror stripped from him here and he's more of a laughing-stock . His brothers torment him and we get an understanding of why he's so strange . The film has a tour-de-nuts performance from Moseley as the brother with a silver plate on his skull ( . . to add dimension , he often takes a hanger and peels off dead skin from his head , around the silver dome , to munch on ) and tendency to use a dead corpse as a puppet to speak through . Poor Williams just gets a raw deal as she tries being heroic , going to ex-Texas ranger Hopper with a recorded taping of a murder by Leatherface and Moseley of two college partiers . Hopper seeks vengeance for the murder of a relative at the hands of the Sawyer family . Using poor Williams , he finds their creepy lair . . an abandoned amusement park .

141,"Text1: José Ramón Larraz ( Vampyres ; Black Candles ) directs this rather chilling portrait of a troubled youth whose thoughts of hatred , directed towards specific people who anger him , causes violent death . Once a person is murdered , Sedastian ( Christian Borromeo ; House on the Edge of the Park ; Tenebre ) bleeds from the lower lip , a stigma that represents a certain action that happened to him in a past life . Not being able to control his thoughts , Sebastian needs help and support from someone . His grades at school are suffering , his incestuous infatuation for his mother growing obsessively , and his detachment for everyone around him creates an isolation . Through his estranged brother ( Emilio Gutiérrez Caba ; In the Folds of the Flesh ) , Sebastian meets Angie ( Alexandra Bastedo ) , who works at a book store , and her friend , Olga , a clairvoyant . Olga's overwhelmed by Sebastian , ominous feelings and visions appear to her concerning him . Hoping to steer Angie away from Sebastian , Olga finds that she is drawn to him , wishing to help , but perhaps attracted to this rather remote young man , who buries his feelings from others . As Sebastian searches for why he has nightmarish visions of a girl he has never met , while also envisioning his own suicide , a hanging by a noose , Angie offers assistance , particularly when tragedy strikes within the family thanks to his volatile feelings towards a close relative who threatened boarding school . A hypnotism unlocks what evil motivates Sebastian's power . . a reincarnated spirit , who committed horrifying deeds towards his family , is provoking Sebastian to violently inflict harm towards those who "" wronged "" him . Angie perhaps endangers herself in getting too close , following him to a abandoned decadent castle which held the tragic events which torment Sebastian . . the answers lie within the walls of this spooky place , but is Sebastian too weak to control the feelings which come from beyond the grave ? This is quite leisurely paced ( . . a slow-burner , to be sure ) by director José Ramón Larraz , as he unveils the mystery at the heart of the film . . what causes Sebastian to kill with the power of thought ? While Sebastian's powers at causing a car crash seem rather preposterous , Borromeo successfully , I felt , achieves at creating a haunting character . . one that is cold and distant , weird and aloof . Almost anyone who attempts to wrestle him into any type of normality , often meet terrible misfortune . Through Borromeo , Sebastian isn't the kind of central character easy at all to embrace . . far from it . You just know , almost from the get-go , that he's a doomed character , whose fate will most probably end in tragedy . I think that director is so intent on telling the complete story that many viewers will have a hard time remaining patient . A back story regarding a family featuring an incest between brother and sister , a father demanding more from his son regarding his focus on studies , and the eventual bloodbath as a result of the sister's betrothal to her suitor and the father's decision to send his son to a boarding school , in a protracted sequence at the end as Sebastian relives it , perhaps removes any mystery , but leads to a chilling finale ( . . Sebastian's strangling of a victim , the body shown lying dead , eyes open , and his looking into a mirror that cracks from his mere thought as he looks at the distorted face that reflects back at him , add a great deal of impact to the rather grim conclusion ) . I think the use of authentic locations adds a great deal to the story and the alluring ladies which occupy the film , Bastedo and Helga Liné ( . . both shot by José Ramón Larraz provocatively ) , certainly will appeal as eye candy . Helga Liné has the role of Sebastian's mom , and one can understand why he'd be drawn to her . . . the woman is incredibly sexy , even if she's clothed within a sophisticated aristocratic role . The desire is very visible as we watch Sebastian listen to recorded conversations of his mom making love to another man , sniffing her undergarments , crying in agony at the spot on the bed where the imprint of their bodies were . The violence isn't gory as much as it's often ferocious ( . . the ax attack on an unsuspecting family ) or unsettling ( . . a female victim falling to her doom from a spier , thrown by mere thought ) . Fans of VAMPYRES might be disappointed with STIGMA because it isn't as erotic or graphic in bloodletting , although a beautiful naked body ( . . the actress who portrays the sister who seduces her brother ) is featured twice , the woman disrobing slowly revealing her impressive figure .

Unfortunately , all the sleaze in the world can't save Black Candles . Most of the movie is a total bore . Other than the one scene I've already mentioned , the numerous sex scenes aren't shocking and certainly aren't sexy . The acting is spotty at best .

It show a bit too much of Hitler and his friends than really necessary and it glorifies the German athletes more with its images than with most other athletes is the case . The 1936 were used as a medium to show the supremacy of the Aryan race and show the German athletes as Übermenschen . Besides being known as the Nazi-propaganda Olympics , the 1936 Olympics are of course also known as the Olympics of Jesse Owens . The black American who won 4 golden medals . A clear booing and whistling can also been heard during the first running that he won and during some of his other wins and attempts , while all other athletes got cheered at , no matter were they were from . This didn't only happened to Jesse Owens though , since he of course wasn't the only black athlete at the Olympics who won a medal . They didn't used only footage from the actual Olympics but some of the images were obviously added later into it . I'm not just talking about the movie its intro but also of the actual sporting events . This can be the drop of a spear or discuss and things like that . It's obvious that it's all added later and that the movie is edited in such a way that it's obvious that at times the crowd reactions and all don't really go with the images but for artistic reason it obviously works out well for the movie . It often gives the movie some diversity and more pace as well . The documentary shows the most important attempts and athletes and of course the wins of all events . It often uses multiple camera-angels for this and some slow-motion as well . There is no denying in it that Leni Riefenstahl was a very talented documentary maker though it of course it remains a shame that she mostly used her talent for making Nazi propaganda pieces , despite always having denied she was a Nazi sympathizer herself . It gives her documentaries a bit of a bitter taste , no matter how technical well made and revolutionary they all are . She gets very much appreciated and recognized as a pioneer in documentary making but she also gets hated at the same time . It doesn't really make her documentaries any less great to watch though . It's always something beautiful , renewing and just unforgettable .

Text2: Don't expect a crappy little amateur film . "" Batman : Dead End "" puts some of the superhero movies made these days till shame . The style and atmosphere is even darker and more sinister then in the 2 Tim Burton Batman movies . You can say that "" Batman : Dead End "" is a more daring movie . The movie shows how the makers can handle several styles and it's the crew that really deserves credit . Everything works perfect especially the cinematography . But let's not forget the cast . Clark Bartram is actually a very convincing Batman ( Better then Val Kilmer and George Clooney anyway ) and Andrew Koenig is the perfect Joker his character is actually much more different then from the original movie in a good way . The character is more sinister and psychotic in a scary way instead of an entertaining . The characters are much more closer then the ones from the comic books . Sure the story is just beyond silly but that's not the point , the crew really showed how they can handle different moments and styles .

144,"Text1: SLIGHT SPOILERSEl is similar in style to other productions made by Bunuel in Mexico . It reminded me of both Los Olvidados and Nazarin . Unlike in the early or late films , the style is more realistic and more akin to melodrama . In fact , all three of these films each contain a single surrealist scene . Los Olvidados has the dream , Nazarin has the fantasy where the wife bites off her husband's lower lip , and El has , well , El's surrealist moment comes near the end and is too good to give away . If you've seen the film , I'm sure you know to what I refer . El can be divided up into three easily identifiable sections , each about a half-hour each . The first is told from the point of view of an aristocrat who catches sight of a beautiful woman in church . It's love at first sight , but he soon finds out that she is the wife of a friend of his . At this point , I was fully expecting a cheapy adulterous romance picture , a soap opera . That was the genre that was dominating Mexican cinemas at the time . Luckily , the film doesn't follow a predictable route . There is at this point an elipsis of time , as that first man runs into the woman . He innocently offers her a ride home . Grudgingly , she accepts . On the ride home , she tells him of how her husband's jealously is destroying her . He's an extremely paranoid man , and he has actually threatened to murder her on two separate occasions . She finds opposition everywhere as she is looking for help . The third section of the film is told from the point of view of the husband . His jealousy is starting to lead him off a cliff . The title of the film actually refers to him . "" El "" is the masculine , singular , definite article in Spanish . Bunuel had a gift for endings . El's is as good as that of Nazarin or Viridiana . By the way , a bit of trivia about that final image : the actor in the cloak at the end of the film , walking down the path , is not the same one who played Francisco in the rest of the film . It's Bunuel . .

Text2: An exceptional social issue film about prisoners rioting , trying to get the press to tell the stories of their mistreatment and trying to get the government to effect change in the prison system . Everything about it is absolutely top-notch : the screenplay and the direction are realistic and very , very taut . Don Siegel , I assume , didn't have a huge budget on this one , and he accomplishes an amazing lot . I love the way Richard Collin's script pits the rioters not only against the establishment , but also against each other . In a cell block full of so many differing personalities ( or perhaps "" criminalities "" is a better word ) , they're not all likely to agree . The acting is almost universally excellent , with the one exception of Emile Meyer , who plays the Warden . He's a little creaky , but all the others , including Neville Brand , Leo Gordon ( who had been a real prisoner in the prison seen in this film ) , and Robert Osterloh among many others , are pretty much perfect . One strong moment after another makes Riot in Cell Block 11 a must-see gem , a low-budget masterpiece . .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
145,"Text1:  Death Wish  has always been one of the easiest movie-targets for critics to bash , because it's overly violent , gratuitously explicit and ? supposedly - the whole movie is nothing more than a promotional campaign to encourage more people to buy a gun and protect their loved ones and personal belongings . Perhaps the violence & bloodshed form the most memorable parts of this film , but the screenplay and character drawings are far more complex than it superficially seems . Not talking about any of the sequels here , but the original "" Death Wish "" is as much a dramatic portrait of a torn man as it is a harsh & relentless vigilante thriller . The main character , Paul Kersey , is not just a randomly trigger-happy gunman . Heck , he doesn't even become a wild bloodthirsty animal immediately after a trio of thugs murdered his beloved wife and abused his daughter so badly she turns into a silent & traumatized vegetable . The story introduces Paul Kersey as a warm-hearted and reasonable man who acknowledges society's issues and even tends to defend the underprivileged people , unlike his fellow colleagues . The tragedy that overcomes his family literally tears him up inside and , after a professional trip to Arizona where he re-discovers his bounding with guns , Paul dwells the New York streets to cleanse them from all the scum . "" Death Wish "" is , as surprising as it may sound , much more realistic then most revenge-thrillers . Kersey doesn't just exclusively go after the thugs that harmed his own happiness , as that would be impossible . Neither does he rescue defenseless old ladies when their purses are being snatched , nor does he provoke burglar attacks . He simply takes on every criminal who crosses his path . Naturally this spawns a large-scaled police investigation as well as a lot of variable media attention . Particularly great about "" Death Wish "" is the sense of filming location . The dark , narrow alleys and the gritty , forsaken parks of New York feel effectively menacing and ominous . Director Michael Winner's views are clearly a bit conservative in some ways , but he has a strong feeling for atmosphere and suspense and he obviously knows Charles Bronson inside & out . Winner , who previously made three films with the veteran actor already ( including "" The Mechanic "" ) , allows Bronson to act like he prefers : silent , but charismatic with very little dialogs but a lot of tough and emotional grimaces . The violence is remarkable and often downright malevolent , but imaginably realistic and confronting . The sequences showing the assault of Kersey's wife and daughter ( starring a youthful Jeff Goldblum in his very first film role ever ) are deeply unpleasant and disturbing to behold . A period masterpiece , but still shocking today .

Text2: The story of this Ben Stiller's effort ranks among the ones that American cinema particularly has a liking for . The flawless career of a fellow at first unlikely to succeed his life but who , ultimately will have become rich , respectable and will have found his place in society . Stiller must have been influenced by this kind of story for his work . He acts Derek Zoolander , an eccentric young man who could have spent his life in poverty due to his limited intellectual faculties . But , fortunately , the world of fashion rescued him and he became a seasoned top-model . I must admit that I'm not fond of this kind of topic , very simply because it seems unlikely to me . A topic like this one prevents a movie from working well . I will attribute without any hesitation , my opinion to Stiller's movie . The absence of directing is to deplore as well as his execrable performance . By his grimaces , the way he talks , he tries to ape Jim Carrey with a much less convincing result which gives ludicrous sequences . Moreover , with "" Zoolander "" , Stiller's intention was to shot a satire of the world of fashion ; but this point is flown over than denounced . Sorry , Mr Stiller you missed your chance . At last , it is not a labored and inconsistent screenplay that will make up the whole . I used the term "" inconsistent "" because Stiller acts a so dumb character that it is nearly impossible to imagine him running a center for children who want to learn to read . Ultimately , it is a humorous piece with ponderous humor . If Ben Stiller proved himself as an actor ( although "" Zoolander "" doesn't belong to his major opus ) , he still has serious improvement to do at the level of directing . Really , the year 2001 wasn't a good one for American comedies . Only , Wes Anderson played his game well with the witty "" the Royal Tenenbaums "" that year . . .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

But while I enjoyed some of his films tremendously ( GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE , CHARLEY'S AUNT , THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT ) , I found THE MEANEST MAN IN THE WORLD to be a huge disappointment . Even though it runs less than an hour , it's a dud . Poor PRISCILLA LANE has a hard time convincing me as Benny's patient sweetheart that she'd have anything to do with the character Benny plays . He's a softy , with a heart of gold , but discovers that people pay more attention to him as a lawyer if he appears to be mean and ruthless in his dealings . So much for the ironic flavor of the plot . Thankfully , Eddie "" Rochester "" Anderson is on hand for a few laughs and there are a few clever moments in the script , but most of it just lays an egg - - a big one . If you want to enjoy Benny in films , I'd recommend GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE as one of his better comedies .

Text2: The Clinton revisionists are still trying to put down this docu-drama which clearly states it's based not only on the Commission Report but on other source material . Indeed , ex-President Clinton has already gone on record saying he did not bother to watch it but looked at Sunday and Monday night football instead . So much for his ability to contradict it publicly . Whatever flaws it has , it gets the essence right . Personally , I see this as a mature piece of work based on the Commission Report AND OTHER SOURCES , which is what we're reminded of several times during the course of this quite accurate account of the painful events leading up to the day America was attacked by a hateful enemy . Whatever liberties have been taken , are well within the rights of any dramatist . The essence is true - - and that is , that Clinton's administration failed to come up with a plan capable of capturing Bin Laden when they had several opportunities to do exactly that . Thanks to faulty intelligence , we may never get him now . My commentary is based on Part I , which I viewed tonight - - but at least I've viewed what I'm talking about , which is more than I can say for those who haven't even viewed the film yet and have dared to express their biased viewpoints already . Freedom of speech is fine , but at least apply it to something that you're qualified to talk about . Harvey Keitel does an excellent job in the central role of John O'Neill , the FBI man who worked tirelessly with CIA and government operatives to come up with workable solutions to capture terrorists . There are no big names in the supporting cast , but they are all excellent , especially those in key roles . I'm told that Part II will deal with the weaknesses in our intelligence during the Bush administration , and I'm sure these facts will be divulged in a reasonably accurate manner - - just as those involving Clinton were handled . I think it looks foolish for the Democrats to object so strenuously to the essential facts of the case when all of their futile attempts to capture Bin Laden were admitted by Clinton himself , by his Secretary of State and others under his command . They're only succeeding in drawing even more attention to the faulty intelligence that was rampant during his administration . In the end , I have a feeling that all of their protests are only going to backfire against them . THE PATH TO is a thought provoking , sincere attempt to tell the story with as much accuracy as any docu-drama is supposed to do . I think it's safe to predict a number of Emmy nominations for this one . And on a purely political note : Why did the supposedly truth-seeking Democrats embrace Michael Moore and his "" documentary "" Farenheit when it was so stacked with slanderous lies and misrepresentations taken out of context to present a biased portrait of George Bush ? They never insisted on the truth when Moore's film opened . They willingly overlooking his many lies and distortions . Just look at how they reacted when the shoe was on the other foot ! They never insisted , as Bill Clinton does now , that the ABC dramatization should "" just tell the truth "" . What hypocrisy ! ! P . S . - Now having seen the entire two-part mini-series , I can add that Part II was even stronger in delivering a well-balanced look at other intelligence failures during the Bush administration . Lots of blame to be shared by both the Dems and the Republicans - - but at least now we've got the FBI and CIA sharing data and we've got Bush receiving daily briefings that were halted during the Clinton years at Bill's own request .

This Godzilla movie had more action than some of the other ones made in the 90's and it also had multiple battles as well . This special force has made a robot version of Godzilla to protect Japan from the real one . Complications arise as a giant flying dinosaur also appears as well as a strange egg . The flying dinosaur seems to be Rodan , but they call it Radon here . Maybe this is what it was meant to be called back in the days ? The egg ends up being a baby Godzilla and scientist stupidly bring it into a city and of course not only does Godzilla come for it , but so does Radon .

They devise a new plan that involves another ship to combine with MechaGodzilla to form a Super-MechaGodzilla .

148,"Text1: Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning western "" Unforgiven "" is said by some to be an elegy to the genre , an honest and probing examination of killing . The murders in the film spring from injustice and lawlessness , and while the picture certainly has a deep texture and rich performances , it isn't always graceful - - nor original - - though still one of the finest westerns of the last twenty years . Two cowboys in a small Wyoming town in the 1880s are responsible for the slashing of a young prostitute ; they're let off easy by the corrupt , power-mad sheriff , causing the ladies of the brothel to pull their resources and put up a bounty on the men . Eastwood plays an ex-gunslinger turned pig-rancher who , along with an aged partner and a cocky , nearsighted kid , takes up the task of killing the men for the money , not counting on crossing paths with the town sheriff and his dedicated deputies . The film isn't multi-layered , and it isn't an allegory exactly , although Eastwood and screenwriter David Webb Peoples do tease the moral issue , as well as showing us how strenuous ( physically and mentally ) it is to kill another human being . The resulting picture is intriguing , absorbing ( after a somewhat rocky start ) and , finally , cathartic . The weak dialogue is an obstacle : Peoples has come up with an arresting narrative , but his trash talk is flabby - - and things gets even worse with the buddy-isms ( Morgan Freeman to widower Eastwood : "" Do you use your hand ? "" ) . As another mercenary , Richard Harris has a strong supporting bit , yet it's his entrance ( and exit ) that allows sheriff Gene Hackman to really flourish as the villain of the piece . Oscar-winner Hackman gets down to grit of this cold-hearted man ( with the meanest steely eyes ) , yet this sheriff is also a clod , a fool living in a leaky house . As director , Clint Eastwood doesn't do much out of the ordinary ( and one has to wonder about those two youngsters left alone back at the ranch ) , but visually the picture looks adept and is paced well ( but I could have done without the heart-to-hearts around the campfire , as well as all the rain ) . As the winner of the Best Picture Oscar , it revitalized the craving for new-fangled , hard-bitten westerns . . . and its individual success bears the brunt of many painful imitations . from

Text2: A teenage girl is treated for a leg injury , but it's soon discovered she has an aggressive form of cancer , which begins taking its toll - - physically and emotionally - - on the victim , her family , and the female doctor who forms a bond with the youngster . Kathleen Beller plays the unfortunate girl with a mix of belligerence and brashness that is , quite simply , off-putting ; her straight-forward cynicism is certainly convincing , and it may be exactly how many cancer patients react when they discover there's very little time left , but it makes for a strident central character who doesn't do much to involve the audience . However , as the doctor , Marsha Mason just about saves the day with a wonderfully natural , sensitive and grounded performance . Given great dialogue by screenwriter Loring Mandel , Mason is able to revel in telling dramatic scenes that evoke whole lives ( such as when she talks about her ex-husband , a movie-junkie who could sit through a double feature and then come home and watch television ) . Mason never sermonizes or stands on a soap-box , she is a caring professional who becomes a close friend ( and may have become a mentor ) to this girl . The film is occasionally pedestrian or heavy-handed - - particularly when focusing on Beller - - and that woeful title didn't help it at the box-office .

Well , the first one was fun - - the second one was rather sadistic and cruel . Now I am not saying there weren't some intense and possibly exploitational scenes in RAIDERS ( such as the face melting finale or the temple filled with snakes ) , but there was a certain sadistic quality of TEMPLE OF DOOM that just looked like the writers were substituting gross-outs for intelligent scripting . Giant bugs and monkey skulls being open and eaten - - complete with slurping sounds and slimy guts was neither entertaining nor needed . The same could be said for the scene where a person's heart is ripped out of their chest by the priest ( also a physical impossibility unless you have the proper equipment ) . Throwing a cute kid into this mess of a film just seemed exploitational and mean - - trying to exploit the audience's natural concerns for a poor little kid . It's no surprise that when this movie came out , the MPAA was pressured to create a new rating - - PG-13 to warn families against bringing little kids to certain movies .

According to most , Ultraviolet is one of the worst ( current IMDb rating : 3 . 7 ) , but I didn't think it was that bad at all . Not good , either . Just rather mediocre . If you're looking for a big dumb action movie , you could do a lot worse . For much of the film's run , Ultraviolet ( Milla Jovovich ) runs around slicing people up with little in the way of plot ( what there is is fairly confusing ) . Yeah , the action sequences are laughable , and they do get repetitive , but they're enjoyable in a stupid way . It's only when the film decides to act as if it had a human level that it gets really weak . None of the drama works , mostly because it's difficult to understand what has already happened and what is presently happening . Plus , the action up to a certain point moves at breakneck speed , so it's pretty dumb to slow things down so the characters can actually speak to each other . Less speakie , more killie ! Perhaps the movie's worse flaw is a difficult-to-follow climactic sequence . Like most bad sci-fi films , Ultraviolet's main draw is the visual design . However bad everything else might be , the movie looks awesome . It's mostly done with computers , like Sky Captain and Sin City . Some of the movie plays as if you were watching your friend enjoy a ( fun ) video game . Not especially recommended , but it's better than people have said .

The wolf , not able to stand up with Mighty Mouse , calls on other wolves for help ( notice that he didn't call them when there was a flock ripe for the picking , though ) and eventually all are bested by a caped mouse small enough to fit in one of their paws . What will the boys at the union hall say at Wolf Local # 342 ? Enjoyable for kids , but nothing terribly inventive here . Worth watching once .

Ron Howard's A BEAUTIFUL MIND shares something in common with SLEEPERS , PAPILLION and THE EXCORCISM OF EMILY ROSE in that it claims to be a true story but when you stop to examine the truth you realise that it's not really a true story at all . Perhaps I'm being unfair in comparing it to the aforementioned because in reality the story is similar to Oliver Stone's adaptation of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS in that the source material is based upon a real character but the film invents it's own version of reality Professor John Nash was a mathematical genius but he was also a bi-sexual and a rabid anti - Semite , you wouldn't know this from seeing Akiva Goldsman screenplay where he's deeply in love with Alicia . I guess centering a story around a romantic subplot adds to the film's commercial appeal , never let truth get in the way of good box office . Unfortunately the producers decide to introduce an espionage subplot where it's revealed later on is part of a schizophrenic delusion suffered by Nash . This subplot is very insulting to anyone with any knowledge or experience of schizophrenia because the victim wouldn't suffer the type of delusions seen here . He would suffer from things like abstract signals where the television would try to contact him etc , a schizophrenic wouldn't find himself meeting mysterious men in black or finding himself with a room mate who is part of his imagination etc There are somethings that make Howard's film worth seeing , things like Crowe's performance which might have won him an Oscar if it wasn't down to Academy politics . Connelly's award for best supporting actress was well deserved as was James Horner's nomination for score though perhaps Ed Harris might be upset about not being nominated for best supporting actor . I have to be honest and say that despite director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman making an interesting movie about mathematics neither of them deserved the Oscar that year . Best director and best adapted screenplay should have gone to FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING along with the Oscar for best picture And remember if you want to know about the real John Nash please read Sylvia Nasar's biography and ignore this Hollywood version

Text2: The suspense never stopped in this film . I sat the whole time on the edge of my seat wondering just what was going to happen next . Two guys , Jim ( Todd Allen ) and Brandon ( Stephen Nichols ) were lifelong friends . Did they have a falling out over Linda ( Tawny Kitaen ) ? They seem to hate each other now , and you always had it in the back of your mind that this had something to do with what was going on . Was there really some evil spirit trying to get out , or was it simply evil in the form of jealousy and hate . The fact that a police detective ( Burke Byrnes ) was always hanging around added to the suspense .

In her first aural offering , Ms . Davies combines silent mannerisms with a sometimes lilting , sometimes grunting French accent . Davies is admired by several U . S . soldiers , but mostly Lawrence Gray ( as Stagg ) . Mr . Gray helps retrieve Davies ' stolen pig , albeit mostly eaten . There are several embarrassing scenes , but the film really goes downhill during a musical number involving Benny Rubin ( Sam ) and Cliff Edwards ( Soapy ) serenading a distraught Davies . This song and dance is followed by Davies doing deep knee bends , in drag , while bragging about her intimacy with a General . Later on , she does musical impressions of Maurice Chevalier and Sarah Bernhardt . They are not as fun as they sound ! Mr . Rubin sings "" The Girl from Neufchâteau "" extremely well , though ; his is the film's best musical performance . The best scene occurs with Davies in a military jeep , with Gray ; she is still disguised as a male officer , complete with moustache and a cap . The scene works because Davies , instead of playing a French woman , play-acts a French officer . Here , she proves herself an actress well-suited for talking pictures . You may also notice her sometimes uncanny resemblance to Lucille Ball ; especially , recall Ms . Ball's "" Lucy Meets the Moustache "" ( 1960 ) . It is most obvious Ball referenced some of Davies ' comic work .

158,"Text1: Nobody would accuse this tale of being taut . It meanders around sufficiently that we get to know the characters , their families , their values - - and therein lies its charm . Eric Roberts is Pauli , the reckless Italian optimist , and Mickey Rourke is his more sensible , principled Irish cousin . The milieu is New York City and it is captured most impressively . These two street proletarians - - waiters and busboys - - ooze with the desire to own a Coupe deVille . Roberts brags that he never ordered a brandy that wasn't Courvoisier VSOP . Their ambition and their taste are palpable . I say this despite having grown up in the area without the slightest desire to live their life styles and lacking any intense affection for Frank Sinatra . Basically , the plot is a cross-cousin of "" Mean Streets "" , with Rourke in the Harvey Keitel role and Roberts as the maniacal DeNiro . Not to suggest that this is an imitation of anything else . The writer , Vincent Patrick , has street lingo down pat , even to the smallest parts , and Stuart Rosemberg has executed it flawlessly . Even "" mozarella "" comes out properly as "" moozarell . "" The two cousins alternately joke and fight with one another , depending on their position on the regression line between Robert's wild schemes and Rourke's more banal impulses . Roberts puts a "" horse physic "" in the drink of a ruthless cop . He engineers a lucrative burglary with the help of Rourke and a locksmith , Kenneth MacMillan , that results in the accidental death of a corrupt police officer , Jack Kehoe , whose only motive for being corrupt was to make enough money to move him and his sickly mother , Geraldine Page , to Phoenix in order to improve her health . ( As I said , the script meanders , but meaningfully . ) Geraldine Page gives a fine performance , by the way , as the self-destructive tough-as-nails street-savvy Mom . The money from the burglary belonged to the neighborhood Mr . Big , a villainous and revengeful Burt Young , who forces MacMillan to leave his family and blow town . He also removes one of Eric Roberts ' digits . And just as he is having a duel of wits with the third party to the crime , Rourke , Roberts feeds Burt Young a cup of espresso filled with lye . The poisoned Young leaps through the storefront window and runs off down the street . The last shot has Roberts and Rourke strolling off , carefree , down the street , arguing about whether it would be better to live in Miami . That's a bit of a weak ending . Given Burt Young's vengeful nature and his position in the organization , I wouldn't give two cents for either of their well-clad behinds . If they wind up as lowly waiters again they'll be lucky . Well , I suppose I've made the film sounds like a terrible tragedy , but it's not . The street lingo and many of the incidents make it as much comic as anything else . One of Roberts ' schemes has to do with betting a bundle on a horse that absolutely cannot lose . But Roberts ' knows as little about racing as he does about keeping out of trouble . He's confused about which part of a stallion must be removed to turn it into a gelding . He's concerned about the colors of the jockey because it makes him look like a fairy . Roberts bets the whole shebang on a win , and the horse loses in a photo finish . The more prudent Rourke has made twenty large by betting on the horse across the board . It's a pretty good movie , full of well-drawn colorful characters and considerable suspense and humor .

160,"Text1: The original "" Die Hard "" was a crudely entertaining action movie with comic villains and a couple of humorous exchanges in addition to the usual violent sequences that had Bruce Willis as Officer John McClane running barefoot through a sea of broken glass . The next episode in the franchise , "" Die Harder , "" switched the locale from the Nakatomi Building to Dulles and was essentially a repeat , duller than the first despite the enhanced special f / x . The third installment , "" Die Hardest of All , "" or was it , "" Die , Whether You Like It Or not "" ? , put Willis back in New York with Samuel Jackson as his unwilling sidekick and Jeremy Irons as the least believable German heavy imaginable . It wasn't up to the standard of the original - - so few copies are - - but it was more entertaining than the second installment . I know . I got the titles all mixed up but these sequels come thick and fast and seem to pile atop one another like cow flops . This one keeps nothing more than the character of John McLaine and the acing of Bruce Willin in the part . He has devolved into a routine action hero . He has no vices . He doesn't smoke . He doesn't say anything that is politically incorrect . He doesn't use cuss words . He doesn't suffer from a hangover . He has no humanity to speak off . It could be Arnold Schwarzenegger in the part , or Sylvester Stallone , back in the 80s , or Dolph Lundgren or Jacques van Damm a decade ago . Interchangeable . In the next installment , may we look forward to a silver-haired Willis , his hair grown back , who is a vegetarian and is serenely awaiting The Rapture , the satisfaction of his utter boredom tempered by the saddening realization that the Jews , Moslems , Zoroastrians , Coptic Christians , and Animists of all stripes will not ascend into heaven to sittith in Paradise ? Well , why not ? This fourth outing has drained the character and plot of any blood the original had . The thing's been almost completely eviscerated . Nothing is left but the gall . The story involves the takeover and the threatened demolishing of the entire computer system that now permits the United States to function . But if you think you're going to learn anything about how this might be done , or if there will be suspenseful scenes in which we follow some hacker through the system , you'd be wrong . It's action , period , . That's all it's really about . There's little time left for humor or character development . Instead of Officer McClane hanging on the edge of an endless elevator shaft in the Nakatomi Building , there's an entire SUV dangling at the end of a cable in an elevator shaft . Not enough ? Okay , there are two people having a vicious fight within the precariously suspended vehicle . Need still more ? There's a guy a few floors up with an automatic weapon , shooting the SUV full of holes . And there is , trust me , nothing funny about the villains . The only wisecracks come from Willis and a young computer geek he drags around by the hair , and they're not very funny . Would you like to see one car smash into another in the Holland Tunnel , leap up , and spin over and over eight or nine times in mid-air ? If so , this is the movie for you . If you're looking for anything in the way of comedy or human interest to balance the action , don't look here .

Text2:  Something's wrong with the entire system ,  says Wilton Sekzer , an aging Vietnam vet who lost his son on . When Sekzer first learned his son had died in the WTC , his first response was a surge in patriotism and a desire for revenge . When we invaded Iraq , Sekzer emailed the government and asked that his son's name be painted on a bomb , a wish that , surprisingly , was formally granted . A year or so later Vice President Cheney said on national television that Saddam Hussein was behind the attacks . The obvious untruth required a quick clarification from President Bush , whom Wilton saw on TV saying , "" We have no evidence that ties Saddam Hussein to . What the Vice President actually meant was . . . "" Wilton , who is no dummy , watched this aghast . He comes from the old school where the president walks on water , and "" if you can't trust the president , who CAN you trust ? "" The name of his dead son had been painted on a bomb that was dropped on a country against which there was no need for revenge . As propaganda , this is pretty well done . There isn't anything spectacularly innovative about it , although the story of the initial attacks on Baghdad by stealth bombers is interspersed through the film and builds up a sense of continuity . Both sides of the dispute are represented by talking heads and video clips . I'm unable to call them conservative or liberal , or right - or left wing , because those labels lie uneasily on the heads of the people who actively promoted the war and the rest of the civilized world . The techniques for discrediting the promoters , though , are clear and familiar . A talking head from the Project for a New American Century ( say , William Krystol ) makes a brief summary statement . And there follows a series of talking heads from the other side that dispute him point by point . ( Ho hum . ) Jarecki seems to divide the country into three parts . There's Dwight D . Eisenhower , who saw the military-industrial complex coming . There are the handful of people at the top who have governed the country from Eisenhower until now . And then there are the other 99 . 99 percent of us who are victimized by traditional propaganda techniques that shield us from what Jarecki sees as the truth . "" Glittering generalities "" is one such tactic . Why are we fighting "" them "" ( whoever they've been ) ? Because they are "" evildoers . "" Because we want to "" liberate "" them . Because we want to defend "" freedom and democracy . "" ( Interested parties can look up some other effective techniques at Disinfopedia . com , I think . ) Jarecki takes a materialist position in explaining why we seem to have been involved in so many wars lately , big and small , acting as the World's Policeman . It's because it's good for business . The film doesn't mention it but the current wave of job outsourcing is also good for business , if you're at or near the top of the ladder . Eisenhower's warning finally was repeated so often that it became desemanticized . And now there IS no military-industrial complex . The seams have disappeared and they are now one organizational entity - - a militaryindustrialcomplex . A revolving door exists between public service and the private sector . People shuffle back and forth almost at will . There's little separation between industry lobbyist and political personage . Richard Perle , one of the promoters , is right when he denies that the nation has been "" hijacked "" by a cabal of ideologues and that if we can only get rid of them , things will go back to the way they were . "" We can never go back to the way it was , "" says Perle . The building of a weapons system is as much a political process as a military one . Parts of the controversial B2 bomber are built in EVERY ONE of the 50 states , and it's the job of representatives to see that the largess keeps coming in . It's not just entirely legal , it's necessary if the official wants to be reelected . How else to account for the billions of dollars so far invested in the Raptor interceptor , a big new monstrously expensive airplane that can do everything except duplicate Donald O'Connor's dance number in "" Singin ' in the Rain "" ? Its only flaw is that it has no mission , since there are no bombers for it to intercept . Well , none of this material is particularly surprising , at least not to anyone who pays attention to the mainstream media and is open to diverse viewpoints . The chief difficulty with the film is that those who need most to see it will never do so . It doesn't have the folksy , popular appeal of Michael Moore's propaganda ( thank God ) . It has less innuendo and more thoughtful analysis . It DOES raise an interesting question though . Wilton Sekzer lost his son and enthusiastically endorsed the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent killing of tens of thousands of Iraqis , the vast majority of them innocent civilians . He wanted revenge , sure , but even if his assumptions about Hussein's guilt had been justified , why did he want to strike out at an entire nation and draw so MUCH blood ? I would ordinarily attribute this thirst for killing to the reptilian brain but I believe biological impulses can be overcome by cultural forces . Every time I'm ready to blame biology , something comes along that upsets my apple cart . After all , a few months ago , a stranger entered an Amish schoolhouse and unloosed a fusillade of bullets , killing a number of the children . He didn't know them or their families . He only chose the Amish school because it was the easiest to get into with a weapon . And what did the grieving Amish community do ? They quickly forgave the murderer . Then they invited the murderer's family to attend the kids ' funeral . Then they invited the murder's widow to join their sect ! There's something wrong with SOME systems alright .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The titular figure ( he’s not only a fast-draw but also has a penchant for corny proverbs a ' la Charlie Chan ) travels in a hybrid of coach and train driven by an Oriental who also cooks for him – the latter is a nod to the Martial Arts action flicks that came to prominence around this same time , a style which got woven into the Spaghetti Western milieu on a couple of occasions ( incidentally , Milian himself would play an Easterner in THE WHITE , THE YELLOW AND THE BLACK [ 1975 ] ) . Gregg Palmer’s character is basically a stand-in for Bud Spencer – he and Milian , then , are involved in a very funny bar-room brawl which is the film’s undeniable comic highlight ; though underused , "" Euro-Cult "" starlet Carole Andre ' is a radiant presence throughout . At best , the film is an average effort in the subgenre – surprisingly tolerable ( thanks largely to an infectious score by Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai ) but , ultimately , inconsequential .

Text2: Just last Sunday I watched Dario Argento's THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE ( 1970 ) for the very first time ( taped off Italian TV ) ? followed in the next couple of days by his well-done 4-part TV series DOOR INTO DARKNESS ( 1973 ) . Anyway , I enjoyed PLUMAGE a great deal ( despite , or perhaps because of , its relative lack of gore ) and feel it's one of Argento's very best ; in fact , I'd rank it just below SUSPIRIA ( 1977 ) and DEEP RED ( 1975 ) ? edging out TENEBRE ( 1982 ) by a hair ! The film is virtually a dry run for DEEP RED itself : the foreigner eye-witness hero ; its obsession with paintings , and the link they provide to a trauma from the past ; and , of course , the figure of the black-gloved killer in a dark raincoat . However , for all its positive elements , Argento clearly has yet to find his footing here , especially in the way the film feels the need to conclude with a psychiatrist explaining ( unconvincingly ) the killer's particular hang-up , in the style of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO ( 1960 ) !","{""output"": ""YES""}"

This is one of a number of early 1980s sci-fi actioners – including TRON ( 1982 ) , BLUE THUNDER ( 1983 ) , WAR GAMES ( 1983 ) , THE LAST STARFIGHTER ( 1984 ) , etc . – which seemed to promote technology , often at the expense of narrative and characterization , but which evoke tremendous nostalgia for someone who was a kid at the time . Still , the film serves as a reminder that cinema was in a definite rut throughout the decade – when you had to rely on a T . V . star for the lead ( MAGNUM P . I . ’s Tom Selleck ) and a rockstar for the villain ( Gene Simmons , bassist of KISS ) ! In itself , though , it’s harmless enough and certainly enjoyable – even if the plot ( once all the scientific jargon and gadgetry is by-passed ) is pretty routine . The action sequences ( plentiful in number ) are O . K . if a bit silly – such as the situation where Selleck has to save a hostage infant from a squat gun-toting robot gone amok , Simmons shooting missile-like bullets , a car chase in which the passengers change vehicles in motion ( a stunt which has just been replicated in the latest Indiana Jones adventure ! ) , etc . Plotwise , we get complications in the relationship between widower Selleck and his immediate family ( comprising a young son and a garrulous robot maid ! ) – which set in with the appearance of his new ( and naturally female ) cop partner ; Selleck’s also fraught with vertigo ( in the past , this had cost the life of a number of people when he backed out of following a suspect because of the heights involved ) – a hindrance which is predictably played upon during the climax , where he has to take on Simmons’ army of acid-spouting robot spiders in an elevator at a construction site ! The film seemed to have its heart in the right place – what with employing cinematographer John A . Alonzo and composer Jerry Goldsmith ( though his contribution results in a shoddy electronic score ) , both of whom had worked on the noir revival par excellence CHINATOWN ( 1974 ) – though conditions were hardly as congenial this time around . . .

Text2: This British-made safari adventure is yet another outing from Warwick Films ( which would eventually evolve into Eon Productions with the James Bond series ) ; although the title itself is meaningless , the plot awfully thin and the budget evidently restrained , the end results are quite pleasant and handsome to look at ( despite the panning-and-scanning from the original ' Scope ratio ) . American Robert Taylor fills in the required "" fading Hollywood star "" spot for added marquee ' value , while fetching redhead Anne Aubrey and amiably clumsy Anthony Newley ? both reunited from the same team's THE BANDIT OF ZHOBE ( 1959 ; a screening of which , coincidentally , also came about for me on the same day I acquired this one ! ) are the proverbial young up-and-coming stars . While Taylor is ostensibly a railroad engineer accompanying Aubrey to seek out her long-lost father and fiancée ( Allan Cuthbertson ) in dangerous Warusha country , there is hardly a train in sight throughout the film but instead as much actual animal footage as their ( limited ) resources could buy . The cast is rounded-up by a would-be villainous Gregoire Aslan , his spunky son played by our very own John Dimech , ( who joins Taylor's expedition and , bizarrely , orders the African porters around in his native Maltese tongue for a while but then swaps for what sounds like gibberish passing for authentic Swahili ! ) , Martin Benson ( as a treacherous head porter ) , Martin Boddey ( as a rival German railroad engineer ) and , very early on , Donald Pleasence as a ship's captain . It was amusing for me to watch Dimech sharing scenes with Newley and Pleasence since both these two stalwarts would themselves come to Malta ? in the late 1960s ( controversially ) and early 1980s ( obscurely , although I did manage to catch a glimpse of him drinking at the bar of a local Band Club ) respectively !","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: THE LOST PATROL plods along in the desert sun accompanied by a Max Steiner score that gives some life to the proceedings , as a small group of British cavalry gets lost on the hot desert sands and takes refuge in an oasis . VICTOR McLAGLEN is head of the patrol and he's his usual blustery self and BORIS KARLOFF is a Bible quoting soldier devoid of his usual horror make-up . In other supporting roles are REGINALD DENNY , excellent as a gentleman soldier and WALLACE FORD and DOUGLAS WALTON as the lesser of the ill-fated soldiers . ALAN HALE has a brief role , as does SAMMY STEIN as a robust Jewish soldier . DOUGLAS WALTON is sensitive as the nineteen year-old soldier comforted by McLaglen when overcome by fear and fatigue . Once the lost patrol reaches the oasis , it becomes clear that there's a stagey quality to the dialog in an attempt at character development , but McLaglen remains genuinely convincing as the tough but tender-hearted man who has to keep his men alert in the face of Arab snipers . The action is slow , but Steiner's music has a mixture of exotic flavors mixed with the feeling of wind , sand and military themes . For ' 34 , the very fact that the music is so prominent is an unusual factor . A wild-eyed Karloff tells Reginald Denny : "" You're a gentleman . You must have faith ! "" and Denny , after extolling the virtues of women natives , says : "" Why ? "" Once again , McLaglen has to take a firm hand in keeping his men under control . Karloff , with a mad stare in his eyes , eventually goes out of his mind and has an unusual final scene . The story ends with McLaglen the last man standing by the time the cavalry arrives and everyone marches off into the desert dunes while Steiner's music reaches a pitch of military flavor .

165,"Text1: Molly Moo-Cow lands on an island that also has Robinson Crusoe on . Crusoe sings how he likes to be alone . He sees footprints that his thinks is some kind of trouble so he chases the tracks before he and Molly bump into each other . Molly licks his face indicating she likes him but Robinson will have none of it and chases her off the island . As Molly gets back on her raft , Crusoe encounters some natives who attempt to boil him . He calls for help so Molly rows back to shore and scares the natives out . Robinson lets her stay then asks , "" But what will I do with you ? "" Molly puts some mud on her face which causes Robinson to say , "" Friday ! "" as we iris out . Other than the singing of Crusoe and the natives , this short is pretty ordinary and that racist ending pretty much mars whatever other enjoyment you may have of this late Van Beuren cartoon short . Only worth seeing for Van Beuren enthusiasts .

Text2: Quincy M . E . : Speed Trap starts one one Sunday afternoon as Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his laboratory assistant Sam ( Robert Ito ) are enjoying watching a Grand Prix on the telly , Kevin Bannon driving his Red Phantom car for the Reddon team is way out in from & miles ahead of anyone else . Then on one of his final laps Kevin loses control & crashes , Kevin dies from his injuries & ends up on Quincy's autopsy table . Apart from a small amount of amphetamines the autopsy proves Kevin died from massive injuries sustained in the crash , case closed . Then Kevins chief mechanic Chick Thomas ( Simon Oakland ) assures Quincy that Kevin would never take drugs , Quincy investigates further & discovers that Kevin had hypoglycemia & that the drugs would have made him pass out in his car which turns an accident into a murder . . . Episode 2 from season 4 this Quincy story was directed by Ronald Satlof & after a the fantastic The Last Six Hours ( 1978 ) which opened season four the second episode isn't half bad either . Speed trap is a very murder mystery based Quincy episode without a moral message or social issue in sight which is just fine by me . There's pretty much everything here that I like about Quincy as a show , the humour , the now established relationships between the character's with the cast & crew having fun with them , Quincy's use of medical & forensic science , a fairly clever murder plot which isn't too obvious & all packed into a neat little fifty minute duration . The science on show here feels plausible although I'm not sure whether you could inject a rubber tyre with acid . The plot revolving around the world of motor sport & racing is pretty cool too & I love the scenes with Dr . Asten moaning at Quincy especially the garbage bag incident . . . There's some on track location filming here , I have no idea which race track they used but it's a fair bet it's one in Los Angeles somewhere . The one thing that stood out for me in this late 70's production was how ugly & horrible the race cars looked , they are all ungainly square box like angles which don't look very aerodynamic or sexy at all . When compared to todays ultra sleek & stylish sporty race & Grand Prix cars there's no comparison . There are a couple of car crashes although I suspect that stock footage was used . The acting is fine by all involved . Speed Trap is a great Quincy murder mystery based episode that has kept the very strong start to season four going & is almost as good as the previous episode the excellent The Last Six Hours , a must for fans & armchair detectives everywhere .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
166,"Text1: This is relatively late Guitry but no worse for that . There's a certain ' feel ' to a film by Guitry that's elusive and resistant to conventional methods of nailing it down but once you've encountered it you'll know it anywhere . Of course having stumbled on something of a signature - a penchant for introducing the actors and technicians at the beginning of a film - he was prone to milk it but it's more than that but what exactly I'm not sure . This time around he casts himself as the Baron of Cantanec who , in middle age , returns to the family seat in search of family heirlooms and in passing transforms the lives of the villagers . Charm is a fairly elusive quality yet Guitry's films abound in it as they do in slightly off-the-wall sequences like the one here in which the whole village takes to wheels via bicycles , tandems and even a bicycle made for three . I wish someone would offer the entire Guitry canon on DVD but until or if they do so we can be thankful for the small Revival Houses in Paris like the Champo which is currently playing 25 titles in Repertory .

The violence in "" Hardboiled "" is very brutal and well directed . The last half hour of this film , which take place in the hospital is full of inventive action sequences . Chow Yun-Fat is really good as a tough policeman and it's also very nice to see Anthony Wong ( "" Bunman : Human Meat Pies "" , "" Dr Lamb "" , "" Bullet in the Head "" ) - what a great performance !

168,"Text1: This is an odd little film that looks a lot like a re-telling of the first half of another Mary Pickford film , DADDY LONG LEGS combined with the films PAPILLON and NIGHT OF THE HUNTER ! ! In other words , Mary once again is a poor little orphan who has a heart of gold AND she lives in a gator-infested swamp and ultimately makes her escape with the other orphans from an evil menace . The film begins at a hellhole in the middle of a swamp . They don't say where it is but it looks a lot like Louisiana or northern Florida . An evil man and woman live there with their evil son and on their farm they have about ten kids ( the number changes from time to time ) who they work as slaves . Some were entrusted to their care by others - - the man and wife claiming they ran a foster home for poor kids . And some others were actually stolen from their parents and brought there ! On the farm , the kids are starved , beaten and some even die due to the horrid conditions - - during which time , the oldest ( Mary Pickford ) acts like the mother to the brood and keeps their spirits high . Eventually , though , when Mary learns that the evil man is planning on tossing one of the kids into quicksand to get rid of her , she plans a daring escape with the kids . In the process , they must survive many obstacles to reach safety . The film is beautifully filmed for a movie from 1926 and the production values are high throughout . However , despite being well-made and interesting , the film is also pretty heavy-handed at times - - especially with some of the religious imagery . Back in the twenties , this probably played a lot better than it does now . Today it seems a tad dated because of this . But , considering how entertaining the film STILL is and how well it stacks up against other movies of the day , it does deserve an eight . Not my favorite Pickford film ( these would be SUDS , MY BEST GIRL and DADDY LONG LEGS ) , but well worth seeing .

He's a flamboyant , quirky individual ( check out his man-in-black wardrobe , dog collar and red wig ) who likes to tell bizarre yet cautionary tales to the unaware , in this television movie based on works by Stephen King and Clive Barker . Coming across new bride Olivia ( gorgeous and appealing Missy Crider ) , stranded in the desert with a broken-down car after her husband Kerry ( Raphael Sbarge ) has gone for help , he tells her the story ( this is based on Kings ' story "" Chattery Teeth "" ) of bar code label and scanner salesman Bill ( Sbarge again ) , who gets menaced by a knife-wielding hitchhiker ( Silas Weir Mitchell ) during a dust storm in the desert , and is saved by a highly unlikely source . In the second segment , Quicksilver , now operating a tent at a carnival , regales pickpocket Charlie ( Matt Frewer ) with the tale ( based on Barkers ' story "" The Body Politic "" ) of successful plastic surgeon Dr . George ( also played by Frewer ) , whose all-important hands are revolting against him , and intend to rally all other human hands in a rebellion against their owners ! In the hands of writer / producer / director Mick Garris , veteran genre film-maker best known for his frequent King adaptations , horror really takes a back seat to comedy . While there is some undeniable tension , suspense , scares and atmosphere are not really in abundance here . The tone of the project , as Garris himself points out , is much more of a playful one ; any points to be made here ( although there is one fine moment where Quicksilver opines "" Does every story have to have a moral point ? "" ) are mostly left to the viewer to interpret . There is a sense of fun to the proceedings , all things considered , and there are scenes involving the chattery teeth of the first story and the disembodied hands of the second that have to be seen to be believed . An enjoyable cast gives it all they've got ( Frewers ' highly capable physical comedy calls to mind Bruce Campbells ' work in "" Evil Dead 2 "" ) ; the excellent Veronica Cartwright and Bill Nunn are fine in support , and there are bits by the likes of Rick Overton , Lin Shaye ( both uncredited ) , and Garris's actress wife Cynthia , with great cameos by Garris's peers John Landis and Barker himself . Well paced , with a fair amount of chuckles to be had , "" Quicksilver Highway "" is a mildly entertaining lark of a film . Nothing special , but not bad either .

Text2: Ilsa ( Dyanne Thorne , in a deliciously wicked performance ) is the Kommandant at a concentration camp during WWII . She holds dominion over both male and female prisoners alike . Mostly , what she does is put them through torture - especially the females ; she aims to prove that females have a higher threshold for pain and will go to extreme lengths to prove her theory . Recommended to me as one of the defining movies of its genre , "" Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS "" is only for those who like their entertainment as vile and tasteless as ( in ) humanly possible . This movie wallows in sleaze , depravity and kinkiness for a hearty and hellish 96 minutes . It offers a non-stop and loving display of the female anatomy and liberal doses of sex are likewise included . The methods of torture are insidious and leave quite the impression . ( Joe Blasco contributes the very effective gore . ) A deeply committed cast plays this sadistic and nasty trash for all it's worth . The buxom Ms . Thorne makes for a memorable villainess , with able support from Gregory Knoph as Wolfe , the male prisoner who turns Ilsa on , Tony Mumolo as Mario , George "" Buck "" Flower ( billed as C . D . Lafleuer ) as Binz , and Richard Kennedy ( billed as Wolfgang Roehm ) as the visiting general whom , in an inspired bit of filth , is urinated on by Ilsa . With the generous servings of sex , violence , and general all-around brutality that it offers , this rates as one hell of an exploitation flick . I now pass on the recommendation for it to anyone with a healthy appetite for sleaze . It remains true to itself throughout and is a completely unpretentious good time , leading up to a reasonably rousing climax and a downbeat conclusion .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

He's stretched his skills to encompass heavies and here , darkly bearded and wrinkled , he fits the role of the Medical Director , half sadistic , half bedside manner . Jennifer Jason Leigh is good as well in a low-key part as a humanistic psychiatrist . Adrian Brody has played characters so obnoxious ( "" Oxygen "" ) that my appreciation of him as an actor was tainted , but he's since redeemed himself in my unimpeachable opinion . He keeps his performance under restraint here , so to speak , and manages to do a convincing if highly improbably love scene with Keira Knightley . And this despite his having a nose that , like Cyrano's , marches on before him by a quarter of a mile . But who put this mish mash together ? Brody , a Gulf War vet , is framed for a cop killing and sent to a hospital for the criminally insane . Like Randall P . McMurphy before him , he upsets the routine and is tortured for it . He's strapped down on something resembling a morgue slab , shot full of dope , and slid into a closed drawer where he hallucinates to beat the band . Something about time travel enters the picture . It's all confusing and not very believable . I'll give one instance of the improbable . Brody is shabbily dressed , an escapee from a funny farm , bearded , disheveled , standing by a roadside telephone on Christmas eve . The sultry Keira Knighley happens to be a waitress at the nearby diner and , seeing this dangerous-looking stranger , offers him a ride . "" Where are you going ? "" she asks . "" I don't know , "" he replies distractedly . Let me ask you , the experienced driver who knows the lay of the land and has seen slasher movies involving deranged hitch-hikers - - what would YOU do at that point ? What SHE does is take him to her home , invite him to fix something to eat while she bathes , and puts him up on her couch for the night . All that's missing is the sign over her front door : "" Welcome Serial Murderers . "" The direction is no help in understanding this olla podrida of unrelated episodes . While on the morgue slab the camera descends into Brody's iris and this is an excuse for multiple flashbacks in high contrast and black and white , only seconds long , and empty of meaning . I didn't bother watching the end . Maybe the creature lifts itself out of the muck and wobbles on to a satisfying conclusion . Isn't it pretty to think so .

Text2: Whatever the setting , and there were many , Danny Kaye always played himself - - the hypochondriacal , stuttering , cowardly , nervously fiddling neurotic . That's pretty much what he is here , and if you haven't seen a Danny Kaye movie this is a pretty funny introduction . The plot violates James Thurber's short story , the point of which was that Walter Mitty daydreamed so much because his own life was so dull . It's probably Thurber's most popular story , although "" If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomatox "" has more outright laughs . Here Kaye is involved in one richly comic episode after another . The famous fantasies are pretty much gotten out of the way before the movie is half over . The "" real "" scenes are at least as amusing . He's a copy editor at a pulp magazine in New York and Boris Karloff , he of the ominous lisp , is pitching him a story about a doctor who murders people without leaving a trace by pressing on a nerve at the base of the skull . "" Oh , we've already used that in ' The Revenge of the Gland Specialist ' , "" objects Kaye . The plot is a mystery about the planned theft of the Dutch Crown Jewels . Something to do with a murder Kaye witnesses ( nobody believes him ) , a black book , Kaye singing silly songs , a chief conspirator nicknamed "" the Boot , "" and a dazzling innocent blond - - Virginia Mayo - - who has a pretty sassy figure . Watching her and Kaye talking about corsets reminded me that when I was a teen , all women seemed to be wrapped up in inexplicable buckles , plastic straps , and clips that only a deranged mechanical engineer could design . Come to think of it , I'm still out of it . I don't know whether women leave body gel on or wash it off , or what bath beads are .

Put a tiny quail under that feathery apparatus and you're talking a two-hundred dollar entree at a four-star Parisian restaurant . There's a likable element of running gags in here too . On three occasions Kaye's blustery boss is holding important business meetings when Kaye enters unexpectedly - - once simply late , and twice more crawling backward in through the tenth floor window pursued by pigeons .

They both have issues - - but do they love each other enough to battle those issues together ? Believe me - - you won't care ! I had forgotten that I saw this . I was 16 when it came out and this ( inexplicibly ) has an R rating . I had always loved Lily Tomlin and wanted to see it . In fact at the time this came out Tomlin and Travolta were ( purportedly ) madly in love with each other in real life . It turns out that was all a publicity stunt to sell the movie .

Tomlin and Travolta CAN be good ( given the right material ) but this script was just so tedious and dull that even they couldn't pull it off . Travolta is as good as anyone can be .

I've seen my share of these films , most of them when I was younger and the tone appealed to me . . . but once you get over the age of 18 , it's hard to look back and not consider them juvenile and tacky . There are a few fairly good films in the genre . . . the first example that springs to mind is American Pie , or my personal favorite , Road Trip .

The plot is dull and progresses so slowly , it will lull almost anyone to sleep . Anyone who doesn't laugh like crazy at the constant utterances of obscenities and references to sex , of course . The acting is mostly overplayed , as is the humor ; gags and jokes are poorly set up and forced . The characters are poorly written and barely developed at all ; I honestly can't tell the group of friends that make up the main characters apart . There is little to no comedic value , all the humor is based on being crude and / or seeing someone in embarrassing situations . That's not humor , that's being provocative and serving the inner jerk in the audience ( ever hear of "" schadenfreude "" ? ) . This just isn't a good film , period . Lazily made , plot barely coherent and nothing memorable neither as far as scenes nor as dialog go .

Text2: As I write this moments after the second viewing of the film , I can say without a doubt that this is one of those rare films that benefit greatly from being watched more than once by any viewer . Having been very interested in the work of director / writer / composer Alejandro Amenábar basically since I first knew of Abre Los Ojos , after watching the Americanized remake with Cameron Crowe at the helm ( and much , much more upon actually watching some of his work ) , I made sure to watch this as soon as I could . I remember being gripped and never really looking away . . . and astoundingly , I had much the same reaction this time , as well . This time , I noticed all the little hints along the way . . . all leading towards the shocking and intelligent twist . Anyone who hasn't seen this , I urge you to avoid hearing what it is , and make sure not to read neither the quotes nor the keywords for the film . And yes , it is somewhat similar to another popular movie ( which I haven't and don't intend to see ) , but a movie doesn't have to be 100 % original to be excellent . The plot is incredibly well-written , and it develops exactly as it should . The pacing is perfect . You're never bored and the film never hurries to get where it's going . The acting is flawless , quite simply . As far as Kidman and the other adults go , this is no major surprise , but the children . . . they are quite simply among a far too small group of extraordinarily talented young actors . The cinematography is breathtaking . The editing is masterful . Something that simply must be mentioned is the lighting . . . the way it almost becomes a character itself , the way it affects everything else , the way it is played with throughout the film . Explaining the lighting as well as the general isolation is the fact that the two children suffer from a tragic illness . . . they cannot survive sunlight . What is amazing that throughout the course of the film , you get used to this . . . the darkness , the thick atmosphere ; it becomes every-day life . Near the end , you find yourself fearing the sun . . . the bright light . Featuring no real gore , blood or violence , the horror is all psychological . The atmosphere and the light ( or lack thereof ) creates a lot of tension and suspense . . . and all of it pays off so well . There are no false scares , nothing gratuitous and the whole film is very close to being sublime . Now , to the real problem with this film , at least my problem with it . . . it's simply not as open as the other works of Alejandro . It's more Hollywood , easier to take in . Instead of challenging you to think , of providing food for thought , questions as opposed to answers ( as Amenábar himself has commented that his films are about ) . . . it reveals everything at the end . It leaves little , if anything , up to the viewer to decide or debate . All is explained . . . the very thing that ruined what potential the remake of his film , Abre Los Ojos . I understand trying to open up to a wider audience , but it's a little sad that he has to make a compromise with his integrity and goals in doing so . With that said , however , this is still not the average Hollywood flick ; there is still nothing in the film that is entirely superfluous , and almost every frame of it is perfection , pure and simple . I recommend this to any fan of Alejandro Amenábar , any of the actors and psychological horror / mystery-thrillers .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

174,"Text1:  Magic Town  is a film about something that we nowadays take as normal but which was a novelty in 1947 . It was about the new "" science "" of public opinion polling . This was only understood poorly and not only by the public but by those who actually mattered : the politicians who would grow to need them . In 1936 the Literary Digest , a popular magazine of the day , had conducted a poll of it's membership on who would win the Presidency . It concluded that Governor Alfred Landon of Kansas , a capable man , would beat incumbent President Franklin Roosevelt . Unfortunately the readership of the Digest were upper class , and basically Republican ( as Landon was ) . In November 1936 FDR won one of the biggest landslides in political history , with three quarters of the popular vote and all the electoral votes except for those of Maine and Vermont . Literary Digest went out of business shortly afterwords . In the decade since Roper and Gallup had been improving polling techniques , but the full system was still uncertain . In the 1948 election there would be another polling snafu , with most of the polls awarding the election to Governor Thomas Dewey of New York , as opposed to incumbent President Harry Truman . Harry won a remarkable come-from-behind over Tom , and enjoyed showing off a headline from the Republican "" Chicago Tribune "" saying that Tom won . In the midst of all this there was a classic sociology study entitled "" Middletown "" . Set in the typical mid-American town ( it was in the Midwest ) the authors ( a husband and wife team ) showed how it's citizens opinions mirrored what mid-America believed . Ten years later the same authors published a follow up study of the town , and it turned there was little change in the opinion differentials between the town and the country . It is with the "" Middletown "" study that the background of this film was based . Jimmy Stewart and his assistants ( including Ned Sparks and Donald Meek - in his last role ) are pollsters , and Stewart has a theory he has been working on that would save pollsters millions . He believes there is a perfect community in the middle of America that can be used for polling it's citizens . He has been studying the problem for several years , and he has found a town where the percentages of the opinions of the citizens perfectly mirror those of the American people as a whole . Stewart goes to the town and sets up there with the intention of using the citizens as his poling guinea pigs , but ( as the movie progresses ) he gets involved with Jane Wyman and the others in the town . When Wyman discovers Stewart's plans she reveals them , and the town goes crazy . Their sudden unofficial power goes to their heads , and instead of giving the sensible polling answers to questions they give outlandish ones . This causes the crash of their reputation , and the crisis of the film . It is a first rate film and has some nice touches ( including Gabriel Heater intoning on the radio ) . As an early story regarding the polling industry it is unique , and the film is well acted and directed ( by William Wellman ) . Perhaps not a Capra movie , but it is a nice one all the same .

Text2: The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( "" The Antichrist "" , "" The Killer is on the Phone "" ) is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo , containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans . There are some very disturbing themes ( child abuse , phony priests ? ) , loads of creepy moments , plot twists left & right , outstanding music and ? last but not least ? a handful of really sadistic murder scenes ! Especially the opening sequence , which is some kind of prologue , is a powerful piece of horror ! What is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy ? When the anonymous man , dressed up like a priest , assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a flight of stairs , it really sent cold shivers through my spine ! Years later , the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair . She inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to stimulate fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positive-minded . She ?

175,"Text1: A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . GULLIVER MICKEY enthralls his young nephews with the story of his adventures among the tiny people of a faraway land . With a nod of acknowledgement to Jonathan Swift , this is a well-made little black & white film featuring very fine animation of the miniature world Mickey discovers . Sleepy Pluto makes a tiny cameo appearance . Walt Disney gave the Mouse his squeaky voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

Based on a novel by Ben Hecht , THE FLORENTINE DAGGER is raised above the level of modest murder programmers on the strength of its unusual plot , moody atmospherics and very fine acting . Sir C . Aubrey Smith graces the proceedings as a kindly old doctor who helps a young playwright and a spirited actress ( Donald Woods & Margaret Lindsay ) find happiness together , despite homicide and a possible family curse . Robert Barrat is also much fun as an eccentric , flirtatious police inspector ; surprisingly , he becomes the story's true hero in the movie's closing moments . The supporting cast includes Henry O'Neill as a Viennese theatrical producer ; Florence Fair as his troubled housekeeper ; Frank Reicher as a harried stage manager ; Rafaela Ottiano & Charles Judels as worried Italian innkeepers ; Paul Porcasi as a timid policeman ; Eily Malyon as a lady who knows more about the murder than she's willing to say ; and wonderful Herman Bing as a flustered Austrian baker . The conclusion comes as a bit of a surprise , considering the Production Code's requirement for the punishment of all movie murderers . . . Much is said , in the film's first half , about Cesare Borgia . It might prove interesting to review the facts of his life . The illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI , Cesare ( 1475-1507 ) started his rise to power early , first in his ancestral Spain and later in Italy . At the age of seven he was created prothonotary & canon of the cathedral of Valencia - but it was in 1491 at the age of sixteen that his career really started to move . Over the course of the next two years Cesare was quickly created bishop , archbishop & cardinal . In 1498 he renounced his cardinalate to become Captain General of the Papal Army . Working hand in glove with the Pope , his father , they furthered their schemes towards wresting a northern Italian kingdom for Cesare . A marriage that same year with the sister of the King of Navarre and the acceptance of a French dukedom , gave Cesare & Alexander the French support they would need for their plots of conquest . By 1500 Cesare was fully immersed in his generally successful campaigns . ( One of his victims was Duke Alfonso of Bisceglie , the husband of Cesare's wicked sister Lucrezia ; that unlucky gentleman had been stabbed by a quartet of Cesare's assassins and subsequently strangled in his sickbed by Cesare's servant . ) Hated & despised by the rank and file of the citizenry of Italy , Alexander & Cesare had to constantly fight against the overwhelming tide of public opinion . Surviving one rebellion in his army - and treacherously murdering the ringleaders after feigning peace - Cesare's fortunes at last crumbled with the death of his father in 1503 . The new pope , Julius II , was an implacable enemy and demanded the release of Cesare's dominions . Cesare was eventually captured by the Spanish , imprisoned in Spain , and made a daring escape . He now offered his services to his brother-in-law , the King of Navarre . Cesare Borgia's short , violent , utterly fascinating life came to an end in 1507 when he was killed in a skirmish with rebels .

The movie itself was completely superfluous , but Lohan's portrayal lent an air of extemporaneity which all but saved the entire production .

Will Maggie ( Lohan ) be true to herself , or will she cower to her father's ( Keaton's ) fears ? For a while there , it seems as if the director or screenwriters were waffling as to which position she would take .

Text2: The film that launched Alan Ladd's career , This Gun For Hire is a very short film like the earlier Public Enemy which gave James Cagney his stardom . This would be the normal length of a B film , but it definitely gets all it wants to say in its brief running time . Essentially we have three stories where all the principal players get brought together in the end . The first involves Robert Preston investigating a reported payroll robbery of the firm that Tully Marshall is the president of . Note that I said ' reported robbery . ' The second involves his girl friend , entertainer Veronica Lake being recruited by no one less than a United States Senator to get the goods on one of Marshall's top aides , Laird Cregar who they think is doing some fifth column work at the behest of Marshall . Finally we have contract killer Alan Ladd who's hired by Cregar to bump off Frank Ferguson who is blackmailing Marshall as to his treasonous activities . Preston , Ladd , and Lake don't know they are all on the same case , but by the end of the film they do . Alan Ladd became Paramount's answer to Humphrey Bogart as a star of action / adventure films and noir films . This Gun for Hire launched his career . He was enormously popular through the Forties , Paramount's biggest star after Crosby and Hope . He played cynical tough guys in modern films , but then branched into westerns where for the most part he was the gallant hero . In fact the ultimate gallant white knight hero in Shane . His part as Raven is a difficult one , yet he pulls it off . He's a cold blooded contract killer , one of the earliest ever portrayed as a film protagonist . Yet he's human and you see flashes of it , his concern for cats . As a cat lover , I can sure identify with that . Raven is also one of the earliest characters in cinema who talks about child abuse making him what he is . Groundbreaking when you think about it . Next to Ladd , the biggest kudos have to go to Laird Cregar , borrowed from 20th Century Fox to play Willard Gates . Gates is a top company executive with Marshall's firm which is a defense contractor which is why the Senate is interested in him . He's basically a jerk who thinks he's so clever . Veronica Lake gets to him real easy because of his weakness for the nightclub scene . And he really doesn't take the full measure of Raven , even though the audience is very aware of how deadly he is . When you think about it what Cregar and Marshall do is unbelievably stupid . They hire Ladd to kill Ferguson and then pay him with hot money , from the alleged robbery . Why would you do that ? Chances are in the rackets they're involved in , they might have need of his services in the future . Not a guy to get mad at you . In fact their double cross is what sets the whole film plot in motion . Moral is never double cross a guy who says and means that "" I'm my own police . "" This Gun for Hire was Director Frank Tuttle's finest film . He was a contract director for Paramount who did a whole bunch of films with their various stars in the Thirties and Forties . When he hadn't worked in a while , Alan Ladd got him a job directing him in Hell On Frisco Bay while he was at Warner Brothers and Tuttle also directed A Cry In the Night which Ladd produced . Ladd remembered and was grateful to Tuttle for helping break through into top star ranks . Ladd was like John Wayne that way , ever ready to help a colleague down on his luck . Veronica Lake is recruited by a U . S . Senator with a fictitious name , but in fact there was a committee looking into all kinds of things like this in the Senate in regard to the conduct of the war . It was headed by a Senator from Missouri named Harry Truman who went on to higher office . I wonder if Truman liked This Gun for Hire ? Veronica Lake got a big boost in her career . She and Ladd became a classic screen team as a result of this film . This film is one great cinematic classic , so important to so many careers and still keeps you on the edge of your seat today .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Left high and dry on their wedding day both David and Ellen decide to travel to Riverview and get to the bottom of this mystery so they can get on with their lives as a happily married couple . At Riverview it turns out that not only do the records check out that Ellen is married to a Mr . Randell but that everyone there recognizes her as being married to him ! Staying at the Shallman Hotel Ellen is even more shocked when the maid Leah , Vivian Vance , not only recognizes her as staying there , in fact in the very same room that she's now in with David , with Lucian Randell on their wedding night but also has a gold pin , that belonged to Ellen's late mother , that Ellen supposedly gave her as a tip ! It just get's too much for David and Ellen with everyone that they talk to in town remembering Ellen and Mr . Randell being married there and finally decide to see this Randell for themselves . Finding out that Randell hangs out at this local jazz club both Ellen and David go to see him and get to the bottom of this mess once in for all . At the club Randell comes up the a shocked and befuddled Ellen , to the annoyance of David , and chats with her as if he and her were married to each other . He then invites Ellen to go into a private room to talk things over as David is left behind paralyzed with his jaw almost dropping to the floor . A moment later behind closed doors a shot rings out and when the musicians and David rush in they find Randall dead from a bullet wound and Ellen standing there in a state of shock with a gun that belongs to her , the murder weapon , at her feet ! Arrested for her "" husbands "" murder Ellen goes into a deep depression that has her institutionalized but all the psychological and medical tests on her shows that Ellen is total incapable of committing a violent act ! If this is true who was in the room with her and Randell to gun Randell down ? Was it Ellen or did Randall who seemed so happy and gay at the time , commit suicide ? Why if anyone did murder Randell why didn't Ellen see it ? The movie "" The Secret Fury "" gets more and more stranger as it goes along and as Ellen slowly loses her mind and grip on reality . David goes back to Riverview to find out the truth about his future wife and circumstances of Randell's death and the truth turns out to be even stranger then fiction or what we were lead to believe that it was up until then ! The mind is not only a terrible thing to waste but even more a terrible thing to play around with and manipulate . This is what happens in "" The Secret Fury "" with poor Ellen being driven insane and into a mental institution hopefully , in the mind of the person who's driving Ellen mad , for the rest of her life . The real murderous psychotic in the movie is someone who no one , especially Ellen , would ever suspect and his reasons for doing these terrible things to Ellen are even more insane that he is ! The killer made one big mistake in his subconscious and innocent quirks that are at first totally overlooked by everyone , including Ellen , in the film . It just happened that as Ellen became more and more psychotic , or paranoid , her subconscious mind picked up these quirks and putting two and two together she soon realized who the person is . Getting the jump on Ellen the killer , who also picked up Ellen picking up his very unusual mannerisms , quickly goes into attack mode revealing the real reason for his actions , cold blooded and naked revenge , but not for what she but her late father did to him . This sets off the final nail-biting scene where David comes to Ellen's rescue without knowing what exactly is going on and who exactly is trying to murder her until the very last , and most exciting , moment in the movie .

187,"Text1: Director Danny Boyle is known for his stylish films in Trainspotting and 28 Days Later . While the latter talks about the evil of drugs , Millions talks about the root of all evil - Money . Lots of it . To be exact , close to 300 British pounds . This film is about taking and using money that is not yours , the morality behind that issue , and the exploration if sudden wealth can change a person's attitude . It also looks at spending large amounts of money ( and the difficulty thereof ) in a short span of time , as this film is set against a backdrop of the British Pound no longer being legal tender after 7 days , given the British's decision to use the Eurodollar . Damian Cunningham is a young boy who's missing his mother , who just passed away , and whom we don't get to see until the end of the film ( in a very touching scene ) . He has been living in his own imaginary world since , reading about and dreaming about talking to Saints , asking them if they had met or known about his mom in heaven . Many times , we look at this world through the eyes of this innocent boy , especially when the huge sack of money literally fell onto him , and he thinks that it is a gift from God as compensation for taking his mom . And that's when the story picks up . His brother Anthony suggested they keep quiet about the finding - reason being the government will tax most of it away , and while Anthony decides to ham it up , using the money to buy friends and cronies , Damian developed a want to help the poor - from people in the street , to Mormons ( the punching bag for some major gags in the film , and the hypocrisy of it all ) , to Africans in need of food , water and shelter , and absolute strangers , which is of course , dangerous when the "" real owner "" of the bag of money come knocking at the door . Given the dilemma of spending , how do you want to do it ? Invest in real estate ? Foreign Exchange ? ( The savvy Anthony came up with those suggestions , and seeing it on screen is hilarious ) . Save it in a bank ? And given your want to help others , how do you do so without endangering yourself , which Damian However , when you realise that the money is not Godsent , but robbed while en route to the incinerator ( one of the many interesting scenes in this film is the heist ) , what do you do next ? Do you continue spending it ? Or give it up ? Do you spend the money as a form of compensation for your house getting ransacked by burglars looking for the loot ? Damian Cunningham is played by Alexander Etel , and you can't help think he's the British's answer to McCauley Culkin at his age . He brings forth pure innocence as Damian , and is absolutely hilarious in his dealings with his imaginary Saints ( complete with halos ) . And the saints go marching on - the highlight of which is St Peter . Listen carefully to the dialogue , as he makes subtle digs into parables and the truth behind a certain miracle - I cracked up at that one . This film isn't complete without the complementary baddie and the uptight community policeman , and also gives the term social engineering a whole new perspective ( even practised by the young ! ) . With Danny Boyle's stylistic editing and beautiful shots of transitions and imaginary situations to complement the social commentary , this could probably be in contention as one of the best films of 2005 .

With nothing to lose , the couple moves out to farm some country land owned by Ms . Morley's uncle . Mr .

Although the lead characters resemble their namesakes from director Vidor's "" The Crowd "" ; their tale , proclaimed as "" Inspired by Headlines of Today "" , is derived from a "" Reader's Digest "" story . The characters do not share factual similarities with the original John and Mary Sims ; for example , no reference is made to their children . Vidor directed , and Keene acted , the "" John "" role inappropriately . Several of the supporting players are also unsuitable . Morley's Garbo-like "" Mary "" is a bright spot among the performances , though . Barbara Pepper answers "" Garbo "" with a Harlow-like "" Sally "" . It's the closest you'll get to having Greta Garbo and Jean Harlow in the same film . However , the attempted "" city girl "" temptation of Keene , by Ms . Pepper , is not convincing .

189,"Text1: Everybody knows that Gregory Widen's original "" The Prophecy "" didn't really require a sequel , but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable . Part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel , meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action , more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery . The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel , and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental . If it wasn't for Walken's performance ( and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig ) , "" The Prophecy II "" surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release . The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth . The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales ( Jennifer Beals ) from getting born . For you see , her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly "" monkey "" and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriel's evil dominion . Thus , just as in the first movie , he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown . "" The Prophecy II "" is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity . Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious , the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you . His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences . On a slightly off-topic note , I often felt like "" The Prophecy II "" ambitions to look similar to "" Terminator II "" ? Gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location , where the final battle takes place , looks very similar to the steel factory where "" Terminator II "" ended as well . Coincidence , I guess ? Overall , this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of Christopher Walken's unique acting charisma ( and who isn't ? ) .

I've seen enough quickies where the level of creativity makes up for the lack of money . The cast and crew here just suffers from a lack of talent !

A veritable feast for Trekkies , and all other sci-fi fans , alike . Ricardo Montalban reprises his role as Khan ; a genetically mutated humanoid who has powers and strengths beyond that of mankind . Longevity , apparently is one of those powers . Exiled on Seti Alpha 5 , Khan and his crew were to have a chance at life in a place where they could no longer interfere with Star Fleet and the affairs of man . But Chekov inadvertently stumbles up on the shell of the Botany Bay , Khan's ship , and realizes immediately what a mistake he has made . He attempts to flee , but it is too late . Khan wants to avenge the death of his wife ; an event for which he blames Admiral James Tiberius Kirk , and he will not rest until he can extract his revenge . It seems Kirk never checked on Khan and his crew , and sometime after they were deposited there , Seti Alpha 5 became a desolate wasteland with murderous creatures which burrow and move beneath the sands . Meanwhile , Kirk is going through what seems to be a mid-life crisis which is interrupted to deal with the travesties of space , and one of Kirk's many love interests , Dr . Carol Marcus , has developed the "" Genesis Project ; "" a device which can create new planets from dead ones , asteroids , and the like . But were this device to be used where life already existed , it would destroy the present life in favor of the new matrix , thereby making it a very devastating and dangerous weapon in the wrong hands . Khan has learned of Genesis , and seeks to lay his hands on it , thus tying the plot to the sub-plot , and making for a very entertaining endeavor . The space battles are extremely well done . The effects are startlingly good , even by today's standards , and the effects of Genesis inside the Genesis Cave , are absolutely brilliant . The new characters ; IE : Savik , a Vulcan addition to the crew of the Enterprise creatively and beautifully portrayed by Kirstie Alley ; Dr . Carol Marcus and her son ; are very well developed without creating long , slow scenes in which to accomplish the task . There is one slow scene in the entire movie , and that comes just before we get to see the Genesis Effect inside the Cave . This is the infamous movie in which Spock gives up his life to save the ship and his friends . I remember picket lines outside Paramount Studios for weeks after this movie was released , protesting Leonard Nimoy's retirement from the series in such a manner .

Text2: Johnny Utah is a Special Agent for the FBI . Utah gets partnered with Angelo Pappas an experienced agent who is more than committed to his work . The two are asked to investigate the number of robberies committed by a group called the Ex-Presidents , who wears masks of Presidents Reagen , Nixon , Carter and Johnson for their robberies . Pappas has a theory that the Ex-Presidents are a group of surfers , and asks for Utah to go undercover as a surfer . The problem is , Utah couldn't surf to save his life . With the help of Tyler a competent female surfer , Utah begins to gain the respect of local surfer Bodhi and his group . Utah forms a close bond with Bodhi , but the relationship between Utah and Bodhi becomes limited when Utah suspects that Bodhi and his group are the Ex-Presidents . when this was first released in the UK in 1991 , i was totally blown away by how well the movie had been made , and thought Bodhi was the finest anti-hero ever to grace the screen since Snake Plisskin . 16 years down the line and it still feels as fresh and vibrant as it did when i was thirteen . my only problem is the script , some of it is genius writing , but some of it is really bad ( though i feel this is due to Reeves ' delivery ) . the action is seamless and the set pieces are fantastic , particularly the siege on the house and the now legendary on foot chase scene which has some wonderful camera work . toward the end of the film though Utah starts to become a little like Bodhi , going against normality for what he feels is right . and Bodhi goes for material instead of kinship as this is seen when he picks up the money and leaves roach's body for the vultures . but the best thing about this film is Swayze and the cinematography . Bodhi is a zen like mystical character , a bohemian if you would , and you can feel the anguish in his eyes when he has to resort to violence to get out of a tight corner . Swayze has never bettered himself after playing Bodhi , a truly landmark character . Reeves unfortunately is still in Bill and Ted mode for the majority of the movie . he is the weakest link in the movie and although i hate to say it , his acting is very wooden . support comes thick with Busey , Petty , LeGros , Sizemore and Mcginleybut the film oozes testosterone . whether it's because it's produced by Cameron , or the director Bigelow , likes to see men turning around in slow motion in the rain , one cannot help but yearn to be a little bit like Utah or Bodhi ( even their names ooze machismo ) . but this is purely a boys own film , with surfing , skydiving and profanity a plenty , you could do a lot worse than spend a night experiencing 100 % pure adrenaline with Point Break . look out for the Dirty dancing , Roadhouse and Bill and Ted references . the epitome of early nineties action .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
191,"Text1: IMPOSTER is based on a short story by Philip K Dick whose stories have been used for the rather underrated TOTAL RECALL and the rather overrated BLADE RUNNER amongst others so hopefully we'd have if not a classic movie then a memorable and thought provoking one . And the story does get off to a good start as Earth is attacked by a superior alien civilisation ala STARSHIP TROOPERS or SPACE ABOVE AND BEYOND . While Earth wages a war for its survival scientist Spencer Olham is arrested and interrogated as being a suspected traitor working for the other side and we've got got all the makings of a very good sci-fi psychological drama Oh dear , this is not how IMPOSTOR works out at all because the story soon turns into a sci-fi version of THE FUGITIVE with Spencer Olham on the run from his interrogator who looks far too much like George Michael for my liking . At least none of the action takes place in a LA public toilet and for what have could have been a very involving , intelligent story we're left with a runaround plot that we've seen far too often before Yeah the screenwriter Stuart Rosenberg should carry much of the blame but it's the directing style of Gary Fleder that spoils much of the movie . For a start he has the failings of a lot of directors in making the future look too futuristic and compare this to Paul Verhoeven and TOTAL RECALL where the director brings so much more on screen credibility by having the characters wear clothes and using technology that a present day audience can connect to . It should also be pointed out Fleder seems to have been inspired by Michael Bay since he uses a ridiculous amount of cross cuts and slo mo filming techniques many of which seem to have been used simply because it seemed like a good idea at the time So what had the potential to have been a good movie is ruined by the screenwriter and director . The ending was not what I expected but even then this isn't a good thing because it leads to a rather large plot hole . I do wish movie producers would treat fans of this genre with a bit more respect

The novel has few characters and little dialogue which doesn't make it an ideal candidate for film adaption , likewise the book's subtle subtext on deviancy which would ask us to empathise with the vampires would be too much for a cinema audience so I feel the changes to the novel are justified .

There is is a lovely thrill comedy bit with Madge Kirby at risk . As with Semon's other comedies of this period , he is the star but not the whole show , and that produces more varied and greater belly laughs . In this period his camera work was more interesting than his competitors , his gags as funny or funnier and although his story construction was no thing of beauty , it served as a fine framework for the gags . What happened to Semon later ? But 1922 , his shorts had gotten out of control . Was it wounded vanity as Chaplin moved ahead , making more money and getting more public acclaim ? Had he simply reached the limit of his gag construction without the ability to make his works truly cinematic ? Did he simply fail to understand the lessons of Chaplin , Lloyd and Fairbanks , that the public had to care about the character ? I don't know . But this is a good comedy . Enjoy it for that .

Text2: Richard Conte and Victor Mature play tough adversaries in "" Cry of the City , "" a 1948 film noir from 20th Century Fox , directed by Robert Siodmak . It also stars Shelley Winters , Debra Paget , Tommy Cook , Hope Emerson , Roland Winters and Barry Kroeger . Set on the streets of New York , the subways , the lower class neighborhoods , the film's atmosphere is perfect , although the story of gangster versus cop is derivative . Conte plays Martin Rome , a completely amoral thug who escapes from the prison hospital where he's recovering from bullet wounds . He manipulates and / or uses everyone he runs into in his quest to get some relief from his injuries , get money to leave town and find his girlfriend . His victims include an equally crooked attorney ( Kroeger ) , a she-man masseuse ( Emerson ) , an old girlfriend ( Winters ) , his mother and his brother . Meanwhile , another kid from the neighborhood , Lt . Candella ( Mature ) tries to find him and at the same time convince Martin's little brother that Martin's choices should not be his . The film is a little slow-moving at times , but Conte and Mature have never been better . There was always something a little dumb about Mature's performances - probably because he didn't take himself too seriously . Just as filming had started on a scene of 1984's "" Samson & Delilah , "" he announced to the entire cast and crew , "" I knew he was gay , "" when one of the actors sat next to a known gay actor . The scene had to be started over . Despite Mature's less than committed attitude , Robert Siodmak drew an excellent performance from him , possibly his best . The underrated Conte was always a force to be reckoned with , and this is one of his best roles . There are some stunning shots to be appreciated in "" Cry of the City "" - my favorite is as Rose Given takes a walk down her long hallway , the shadows that look like prison bars giving way to curtains and Rose's face and body walking into focus . Much to like here , but in the end , it's quite predictable , right down to the ending . But the acting , atmosphere and characters created are a real treat .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

I just don't see that being the case unless we totally reworked the movie into something completely different and very very boring . There is really nothing to this movie , in the end there are no real surprises what you think is what you get and it plays more like a movie about child custody set against the backdrop of a haunted apartment complex . I do not blame the cast , as they all did a good job , but sometimes a movie is just bad for other reasons such as story , lack of mood , and no real scares considering this is supposed to be horror . Actually , I can now see why this movie is listed as a drama first , thriller second , and lastly a horror . In fact , they should just drop the horror part . The story , mother moves into a very unattractive apartment complex on an island in New York while in the midst of said custody battle . Water drips from the ceiling in the bed room and seems to be originating from the upstairs apartment . Could be rowdy kids pulling a prank or something on a more supernatural note , but this does not help the mother as she starts questioning her sanity . Throw in a few scenes of a ghost that almost seem not to belong in this film and you have your movie . You may want to check it out if you like a really mild thriller , but otherwise if you are looking for scares , alas there are very few of them ( actually I would say there are none ) I would avoid this movie and wait for the next Japanese horror turned American remake or see something of ours that isn't rated pg-13 and can put ya to sleep . Though if you do go and you do fall asleep , just ask the person next to you what you missed and they will probably tell you "" Absolutely nothing "" . And on a side note , don't vote yes or no on my review of this movie unless you have not seen it and this review proved helpful or not helpful in you deciding to see it , because that is what it asks not whether you agree with it or disagree like so many people seem to think it says .

Text2: The story is not quite as unsettling and eerie as say two or three and I do prefer my game to have a good story more than just fighting . However , that being said the improvements made in the combat engine and the way you move can not be ignored . Neither can you ignore the fact Travis , the lead character this go around is the best butt kicker in the series as well . The dude can simply beat the enemies to death with his bare hands . The atmosphere is still top notch as well as Silent Hill is nice and foggy and you get to visit many locales during your trip through this nightmare town uncovering secrets about Travis ' life as well of that of a mysterious little girl . The story is rather good , I liked two and three's a bit better as there really is nothing new being brought to the table . Basically , it is a prequel to the first Silent Hill game . You are Travis , a trucker who while on the road one night nearly hits a girl . He follows her and ends up pulling another girl from a burning house and after this wakes up in the nice little town of Silent Hill where he heads to the hospital to check on the girl . Suffice to say it is not to long before the nightmare creatures that inhabit Silent Hill are hot on Travis ' tail as he must also navigate a mental institution , a theater , and a hotel to uncover the mysterious secrets surrounding his own life as well as the little girl . You also have the ability to enter a more evil form of Silent Hills as in previous editions . This time it is a bit less subtle than the way you entered the more demented world in part three as you touch mirrors , but it is rather cool looking in the mirror and seeing the more warped version of Silent Hill , or the slightly more normal Silent Hill . Fighting the monsters is fun too as I killed most of them by beating them down with my fists , still you have your typical pipes and hammers and guns too . Along with the weapons you typically find in Silent Hill , there are also some that are a bit different as you can now throw everything , but the kitchen sink at the enemy . So for a nice little trip to Silent Hill , try this game on for size . . . for me it is the best trip yet .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: Geena Davis , Samuel Jackson and Craig Bierko star in "" The Long Kiss Goodnight , "" a 1996 film that had a woman in the Arnold Schwarzenegger role for a change . Maybe that's why some people didn't like it , but I loved it . I thought it rocked , and I thought Davis did a terrific job as Samantha , an amnesia victim living with her husband and child and working as a school teacher . After a horrible accident , elements of her old self start to emerge - a facility with knives , strange behavior - and then people start trying to kill her after she appears on television in a holiday parade . A detective who's been trying to dig up info about her ( Jackson ) has found out some information - and Samantha has to leave her family and go on the road with Jackson in search of her true self . Gradually , all of the danger that she's in forces her old self to completely emerge - Charley Baltimore , government assassin . This film will keep you glued to the TV . It packs in a lot of action , a lot of excitement , and a lot of suspense . It also has some wonderful performances . Craig Bierko plays the most evil man who ever lived , I swear - and this guy was the Music Man on Broadway . Samuel L . Jackson is excellent as the detective who had no idea what he was getting into . And Davis is incredible - a sweet mom one day , with flowing locks and a radiant smile - to a cold-blooded , foul mouthed killer the next , with short blond hair and artillery . As someone mentioned here , the script treats this not as amnesia but as a real split personality . Davis and Jackson are dynamic together , playing off one another beautifully . I mustn't forget the great comedy embedded in this film and the witty dialogue . The sound track is great . The plot is also fascinating , given that this was made in 1996 .

195,"Text1: Who knows what is going on in the mind of a serial killer . Is is synapses failing to fire correctly , or the lack of some chemical ? Can psychotropics solve the problem ? Danish filmmaker Kim Sønderholm makes a valiant attempt to show a man who struggles with his impulses , and , ultimately , loses . A hint of child abuse is given in a zombie encounter with his father , who was killed , along with his mother , in a fire . Craig's ( played by the director ) inadvertently put his sister in a coma in the fire . He is plagued by guilt over his sister's condition and seeks psychotherapy . Sønderholm must have a bit of Scientology in him as his psychotherapist is a real loser . Lithium seems to help Craig , but it seems strange that he takes it like breath mints out of a tin whenever a panic attack is revealed . Maybe that is the way medicine is dispensed in Denmark . But the slights to his manhood continue from all directions and , at some point , the medicine loses it's effectiveness and he gives in to his murderous impulses . There is little blood and gore , so don't expect Saw . It is more about the drama going on in Craig's head . His method is usually strangulation . His targets are always women , although he gets most of his insults from men . He ends up chasing a girl though the woods and raping her after he shoots her . This is where I have a problem with the film . Not the supposed necrophilia , but the fact that it doesn't end with his shooting , as it should . It goes on for two more scenes that just don't make sense to me . Those that like their horror more psychological than bloody will find this to be an interesting film . The camera work of Jan T . Jensen and Søren Ulfkjær was excellent , and the soundtrack will please all those who like their music hard and loud . Both really fit well with the script . A little humor and a lot of flesh makes for icing on the cake .

If played out well right down to the realistic looking footage they were shooting , including the "" interviews "" with various associates and professionals . In the end the producers give the entire thing away with a rather hokey finale .

196,"Text1: Fans of Vincent Price know and love him for his horror films and with a title like THE BAT , you'd think that this is a film about some evil murderous bat , . . . right ? Well , despite the title , it's actually a murder mystery about some stolen stocks and the murders that occur to try to recover this fortune . For me , this wasn't a problem - - it was still a pretty good film . But some will no doubt be disappointed that this isn't a horror flick . Because this isn't exactly a horror film , it also isn't so surprising then that Agnes Morehead is the star of the film and Price is actually a supporting player . She is a mystery writer ( like TV's Jessica Fletcher ) and the mystery appears to be unfolding all around her . So , it's up to her and her small band of helpers to unravel who is dressing up in silly garb ( the mystery person in a black hood refers to himself as "" The Bat "" - - hence the title of the film ) and killing people in the house Ms . Morehead is renting . The film features decent writing and acting , but in many ways it's obvious that this was originally a stage production . This isn't a terrible thing , though the staginess of the film is apparent at times . Additionally , since the ladies inside the rented house were being constantly threatened , I couldn't help but think "" why don't they just leave the house ? ? ! ! "" . Duh . But despite all this , it's still a decent time-passer and worth a look .

Text2: I have seen many international films over the years and quite a few of these were Japanese . In addition , unlike many parents , I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium . Yet , with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie . Now this isn't to say I didn't like it , but so many times I just couldn't understand exactly what was happening . Interestingly , when I saw the film again , I understood it much better and appreciated it much more . And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan . See it , but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times . I know that each time I did , the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references . Now , several years after I first saw it in the theater , I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it's practically second-nature to follow the film . So , for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium , this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy , though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime , it's very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you ! ! As for the film , the animation is the best I have seen in any Miyazaki film , the story deep and fascinating and it's full of cute and endearing little touches that make the movie magical .

197,"Text1: The same year that "" Silent Night , Deadly Night "" caused a furor in North America , this silly horror film came out of England . In this case , the killer is not the one wearing the Santa Claus costume ; the victims are . This brutal psychopath wears various masks and utilizes different methods , and the Scotland Yard detectives on the case prove to be completely ineffective at making any progress on the case . Kate ( Belinda Mayne ) is personally affected when , at a party , her father gets killed for wearing a Santa Claus suit . Apparently a troubled production , this might certainly explain the holes in the plot . Star Edmund Purdom started out as director ( also starring as Detective Inspector Harris ) , to be replaced by writer Derek Ford , who in turn was replaced by editor Ray Selfe . The result is a jumble of a story , with the motivation for the killer finally explained just before an abrupt ending . Produced by Dick Randall ( who'd also had a hand in "" Pieces "" , which also featured Purdom ) and Steve Minasian ( one of the driving forces behind the "" Friday the 13th "" franchise ) , this movie gets down to business quickly . It's pretty much one murder after another , some of them enjoyably disgusting and sadistic . ( One Santa gets burned alive and another loses his manhood in one memorably nasty moment . ) The level of sleaze is high ; co-star Pat Astley as Sharon gets to bare her breasts . She also figures in an effectively depraved moment , when , clad in little more than a Santa coat , she gets molested by the killer's knife . Although the movie features the gorgeous Caroline Munro in a hilariously cheesy musical performance , the cast isn't much to speak of , with the exception of Alan Lake as Giles and Mark Jones as Sergeant Powell . Leggy Kelly Baker is quite easy to watch as an eyewitness to one murder who gets kidnapped and locked away by the killer . "" Don't Open ' Til Christmas "" is one very absurd , tacky , and nasty piece of work that , if nothing else , at least has the elements to qualify as a fairly entertaining slasher .

Text2: Cold War era science-fiction / political paranoia thriller about computerized intelligence ( the titular "" Colossus "" ) designed to defend the U . S . However , no-one , including system creator Charles Forbin ( soap opera mainstay Eric Braeden ) could have foreseen just how intelligent this system would become , when it becomes determined to link up with its Soviet counterpart and control the balance of world power . A slow , quiet , and methodical movie that is a true product of its time ( and also a forerunner of movies like "" War Games "" and "" The Terminator "" ) , this movie would probably not appeal to the modern viewer , with its less advanced technology and a notable de-emphasis on quick pacing and action sequences . Nevertheless , it does its job pretty well . It's reasonably intelligent and disquieting , exploring a common movie theme of the dangers of turning our lives over to artificial intelligence . This is a well cast ( there's a number of familiar faces present ) and well directed movie . It does maintain interest , although people with shorter attention spans might be inclined to let their minds wander . All in all , a thoroughly decent movie that leads to a downbeat , almost kind of non-ending ( there's no big melodramatic finale ) which helps to make it more memorable than the kind of movie that would order up a happy ending ; this makes it more typical of the kind of iconoclastic , cynical films that would start to appear in the 1970's .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
198,"Text1:  Vertigo  is considered Hitchcock's masterpiece by high-brows and viewed as a slow , dull movie by proletarians . Indulge this Olympian generalizations for a moment . If you don't know the story by now , it goes something like this . Jimmy Stewart is a San Francisco detective retired from the force because he contracted a severe case of acrophobia on the job . An old college friend , Gavin Elster , hires him to follow Elster's wife , Madeleine ( Kim Novak ) around . Elster is afraid Madeleine is going nuts . Stewart takes the job and is soon hooked on the lovely Madeleine . He rescues her from a suicide attempt , lugs her unconscious body to his own apartment , undresses her , and puts her in his bed until she recovers . Stewart and Madeleine fall in love , but she's still balmy and climbs to the tower of an old church to kill herself . Stewart can't follow because of his acrophobia . He blames himself . Later , while wandering the city streets , he spots a girl named Judy Barton ( also Kim Novak ) who resembles the departed Madeleine . Stewart gets to know her , squires her around , and has her dress and groom herself exactly like his lost love . Then he discovers that Judy IS in fact his lost love . Judy was in cahoots with Gavin Elster and Stewart was a victim of a hoax designed to get rid of Elster's real wife . It ends tragically . It's neither a masterpiece nor dull , really . I don't doubt for a minute that it's Hitchcock's most personal movie . Cripes , he's got this luscious blond he keeps dressing and undressing , gorgeous and sexy , but also unattainable and ghostly . ( A ghost of substantial heft , though . ) That was always Hitchcock's fantasy , the icy Nordic who would attack you in the back seat of a taxi . ( Poor Alma Reville , his wife , a rather homely brunette dwarf . ) On top of the personal interest that Hitchcock lavished on the story , he adds some technical dazzle . Not too much . The acrophobic detective stares down the tall campanile and the camera simultaneously zooms in and dollies back . The tactic was so successful it's been imitated a number of times . And when Stewart and Novak finally kiss and make love in her green-lighted apartment , the director has them and the camera on a turntable that slowly revolves and shows us varied haunting backdrops . And the movie wouldn't be what it is without Bernard Hermann's romantic and oneiristic score . The whole film is meant to be dream-like and that's why it's understandable that some people would see it as irritatingly slow . It follows Edgar Allan Poe's theory of literary esthetics . Poe threw reason off the bell tower and went for eerie effects , period . A man buries a murder victim under the floor but nails a cat in with the body by mistake . How can anyone miss a cat that's in the burial chamber ? I can imagine viewers now , squirming , and asking , "" Where the hell is the logic in this ? "" Let's put it this way . You are a girl named Judy Barton . You're pretty but have no marketable skills . A very wealthy man comes to you and offers you money to help him kill his wife . All you have to do is impersonate the wife and trap a former detective named Jimmy Stewart into falling in love with you and then lead him to a place where the wife can be safely killed and still look like suicide . Then , after the rich dude takes off for Europe , leaving you to become your slovenly self , you accidentally run into the victimized Stewart on the city streets . ( In a city of 700 , 000 . ) He doesn't recognize you , naturally , because now , having reverted to your original persona , you look like an overly made-up hooker . But he follows you home , knocks on your door , introduces himself , and asks you for a date . I ask you - - the discerning , sophisticated , somewhat street-savvy viewer - - would you accept ? Would you date a man who will almost inevitably find out you're a murderess ? One slip of the tongue could do it . The only person stupid enough to accept would also bury a black cat alongside a dead body . Kim Novak is a lot more effective as Madeleine than as Judy . The latter persona is coarse but tender too . The former is elegant and speaks in a ghostly whisper . Kim Novak was probably right for the part . As Judy , she has these overemphatic eyebrows that lend her the appearance of a Universal monster , perhaps one of the lesbian vampires that smiles as she pours you the drugged wine . But of Hitchcock's other actresses at the time , who else could have done better ? The photography is splendid . And the director takes us on a Cook's Tour of many of the Bay Area landmarks - - Ernie's restaurant ( now gone ) , Muir Woods almost , The Palace of the Legion of Honor , Fort Point , Mission San Juan Bautista ( which has no tower ) , Point Lobos . And every day is perfectly sunny . Stewart re-dresses Novak at an expensive shop that was Ransohoff's at the time . It , too , is now gone but I took my wife to its less expensive replacement and insisted she buy a signature gray suit with a soft white shirt and a pair of brown heels . My insistence led to its usual dead end and after a slight but embarrassing scuffle we wound up with some cheap scrap of an apron . ( She never wore it . ) It's only in a film in which there is no place for common sense , let alone genuine logic , that a man can create a new woman or resurrect an old one . I find it a fascinating movie , technically almost perfect , and worth repeated viewings if they're not repeated too often . ( It's pretty depressing . ) It's at once demanding and rewarding . And I'm certainly glad Hitchcock made it , if only to get it out of his system .

Text2: The screen song has a long history . Take a look at photos of the earliest purpose-built movie theaters and you see that they are advertising sing-alongs inside . The earliest regular series of talkie cartoons were the Fleischer follow-the-bouncing-ball sing-alongs from 1926 - - two years before Disney supposedly invented the sound cartoon with STEAMBOAT WILLIE . And the studio - - which became FAMOUS in the 1940s - - continued to chunk them out . This is a fairly typical one : a series of blackout gags , followed by an exhortation to sing along with the bouncing ball - - the song being "" I'm an Old Cow Hand "" .

199,"Text1: Considering that Harry Langdon was one of the top movie comics of the mid-1920s , this film will probably come as quite a bit of a surprise because he plays a role that isn't terribly funny - - nor was it really intended to be . Instead of a hilariously funny film , it's a pleasant little movie with a few small laughs at most . Now this isn't really a complaint , because it IS a decent film , it just isn't a slapstick or belly-laugh comedy that you might expect from Langdon . According to the stories I have read about Langdon , after some success in films it all "" went to his head "" and he quit the studio and started off on his own - - thinking he could write , direct and produce masterpieces . Considering that he is almost unknown today , you can tell he was not a success in this venture . In fact , for years he had a hard time getting work until Hal Roach hired him in the late 1930s to write gags or act in his new one-hour format films . I've seen quite a few of them lately , though this is only the second starring Langdon I've seen . All of them are moderately funny - - some worth seeing and some definitely not ! None of them are stylistically like Roach's Laurel and Hardy or Our Gang films , but are instead light comedies . In this one , Langdon plays a forgetful mouse of a man who has been happily married for 20 years . Infortunately , on the night of his surprise anniversary party some bizarre events conspire to make him miss the party . He had been accused of murdering a woman but instead it was only a mannequin from his department store he nicknamed "" Carole "" - - perhaps after actress Carole Landis who was under contract with Roach at the time . Instead of telling his wife that he was late because he was at the police station he tried to sneak back in the house . The wife naturally catches him along with a shoe and some other accessories from the mannequin and she thinks he's been having an affair . This story idea is pretty novel but unfortunately one where a SIMPLE explanation could have avoided the mess that their lives became and that is a problem . But instead of being a normal person and just telling her exactly what occurred and taking her to the police station to verify the story , we spend forty more minutes until the truth comes to light . Now understand , the film is enjoyable and worth a look - - it's just that the plot doesn't make much sense and they should have worked this out better before filming . IMDb claims it was shot in only 15 days and this would lend credence to my feeling they rushed the film before working out all the kinks . Watchable but nothing more .

Text2: Because this movie starred John Garfield and was made by Warner Brothers , I was quite surprised at just how ordinary and unexciting this movie was . Plus , it was a WWII American propaganda film that tried to mobilize the public against the Nazi menace - - just the sort of film I usually love . But , instead of the menacing and almost inhuman enemy , this movie took a more cerebral look at the enemy and presented a much more restrained look at the Nazis . In the process , they also made an "" action "" movie with hardly any action and A LOT of talking . The end result was certainly watchable , but not exactly interesting or worth my time . It will surely sound low-brow , but I got very tired of John Garfield being so pleasant - - I wanted to see him shoot some of the bad guys . But , again and again , the action just didn't heat up . A case in point - - a guy breaks into the apartment and attacks Garfield . Garfield subdues him , . . . and they just talk ! The guy isn't the least bit cooperative , but instead of either plugging him ( shoot him , in other words ) or at least beat the stuffing out of him . If I was attacked by Nazi agents and I got the upper hand , you bet I would have let ' em have it ! And so would the REAL John Garfield ! !

200,"Text1: Because of the prominence of the abolition movement in the 1830s - 1860s , other American social movements of the day are not thought of very much . If you are interested , read Tyler's book FREEDOM'S FERMENT , which discusses the international peace movement , woman's rights , and other movements of equal interest in that period - only these did not lead to Civil War . The woman's suffrage movement had begun in 1848 in upstate New York , but it really does not get the momentum that made it memorable until the 1870s . Then Susan B . Anthony goes on trial ( also in New York State ) for daring to try to vote in a national election . Also Victoria Woodhull throws her hat into the ring ( unofficially ) for the Presidency in 1872 . Later Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organize the woman's movement , so that after they both die in the early 1900s it grows until it achieves suffrage by Federal Constitutional Amendment in 1919 . THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM is not the only film to tackle early woman's suffrage . There is a bit about the movement in the character of Miss Massingale in THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL , who keeps confronting ( and romancing ) Burt Lancaster's army Colonel . But THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM is actually the only film from that looks at the movement at a critical moment in it's history . A little background is needed here . In the early days of the women's suffrage movement , there was considerable debate regarding allying the movement with other social movements of the day . However , Anthony and Stanton were convinced by Frederick Douglass to work for abolition , because if slavery was abolished ( Douglas argued ) woman's servitude would have to follow soon after . But in the post-Civil War years , the relationship between Douglass and the suffrage leadership soured . Douglass , once the 13th , 14th , and 15th Amendments got passed , was more concerned about African American ( read African-American males ) consolidating and expanding their gains . He started to curb joint efforts with Stanton and Anthony on woman's rights , claiming that it just was not the time ( although his previous argument had been to strike when the fire was hot ! ) . Anthony and Stanton eventually over-reacted . They never forgave the betrayal by Douglass , and soon they managed to make the woman's suffrage movement lily white ( and rather racist towards the former male slaves who now - theoretically - could vote ) . A small African-American woman's suffrage movement pushed forward too , but it was fighting antagonism by male African-Americans , and racism by white women who should have been their sisters in arms . The lesson though was now burned into the heads of the woman's movement - don't ally yourself with other causes . And , interestingly enough , this is the center for part of the plot of THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM . Betty Grable tries to keep her friends from allying themselves with another social movement which grew with woman's suffrage - Prohibition . She is unable to do so . In the decades from 1870 - 1920 many woman suffrage figures , like Carrie Nation , were also outspoken supporters of prohibition . These women ( like Nation ) had homes that had been wrecked by alcoholic husbands , so their stand and unity with Prohibitionists made sense . But the bulk of the woman's movement avoided this , because they did not want their political agenda tainted by a rival one . The same situation happened in the English suffrage movement too , when Mrs . Pankhurst's daughters split on allying with the British Labor Party , and the anti-war movement . Sylvia Pankhurst remained united with Labor leader and pacifist Keir Hardie , but her sister Cristobel was clever enough to offer to support the war effort in return for Asquith and Lloyd George's support for woman's voting rights . THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM has several things working for it . The two leads had a good story . Dick Haymes was actually better in this film as the hero who learns to respect working women , than he was as the son in STATE FAIR . Grable actually had a role in a musical that did not begin and end with her gorgeous legs , and moderately pleasing singing voice - it is her meatiest musical role . The Gershwin score is minor Gershwin , but still enjoyable . Like minor Marx Brothers or minor Van Gogh etchings , they are still better than most people's best . The supporting character actors cast , led by Gene Lockhart , Allan Joslyn , and Elizabeth Patterson manage to give a gentleness to the story , befitting the setting in Boston in the "" Gilded Age "" . It is a nice musical - not great , but enjoyable .

201,"Text1: Welcome to the Isla Fisher show , where despite her diminutive size she holds court throughout and I thought she's finally getting the recognition she deserves in being able to marquee a film herself . One cannot forget how she burst onto the scene in The Wedding Crashers as the psychotic stalker after Vince Vaughn , and from there some other bit parts like those in The wedding Daze , and one of my favourites from last year , Definitely , Maybe . She has this indescribable aura , that goofy grin , and that incredible perfect timing for physical comedy , without looking stupid . One can easily dismiss Confessions of a Shopaholic as just another chick flick , and its premise is nothing not already attempted by the East ( in the film The Shopaholics starring Cecilia Cheung before her fall from grace ) , even though this film is based on a best selling novels by Sophie Kinsella . It's an interesting illness that Rebecca Bloomwood ( Fisher ) suffers from , where she lives a Jackyl and Hyde lifestyle , having fashion labels as close friends whom she addresses intimately by first names , and owns plenty of clothes , shoes , and enough accessories that can fill her entire room . Her Hyde hears mannequins at shop windows call out to her , and interaction with animated objects is just part of her everyday life . Hyde too comes with a magic ( credit ) card that grants instant happiness delivered as soon as a magnetic swipe at the cashier's . But her Dr Jackyl is what makes the film a draw actually , because in times like this of economic hardship , it just hits home the fact that quick credit is the path to the shambles that many would readily share their experience . Joining a financial magazine as a stepping stone toward her real objective in writing for a fashion mag in the same umbrella of publishers , Rebecca soon finds herself making the best use of her opportunity in combining her zilch knowledge in finance with the pizazz and flair she has for fashion , and writes under the moniker of The Girl In The Green Scarf , dispensing some real life financial advice that even a layman ( or woman ) would understand and make sense of . Which of course is complete irony for Rebecca , as she doesn't practice what she preaches . As we know from the onset she's someone who can't balance her financial , and is already deep in debt no thanks to her impulses to buy . The ditzy klutz teaching everyone how to live a financially responsible life , and slowly realizing her influence and clout amongst her readers , winning new fans from the woman on the streets to the suits in boardrooms . But what's a movie without an adversary ? So we have a stereotypical bean counter in Derek Smeath ( Robert Stanton ) , complete with slicked back hair , ugly glasses and a dogged attitude of a debt collector . This provides avenue for a number of laughs , besides those in the self-help therapy group , or cat fights amongst those looking for cheap bargains . Yes , there are the inevitable clichés , unfortunately . Besides Fisher's charismatic turn , she's surrounded by a supporting cast whom you can broadly categorize under the great lookers , and those with gravitas . Luke Brandon ( Hugh Dancy ) as Rebecca's object for affection ( other than fashion labels ) and Alicia ( Leslie Bibb ) as a long legged rival belong to the former , not very interesting other than being eye candy , while the powerhouses of Kristin Scott Thomas and John Goodman bring some extra oomph in their roles as a French magazine editor ( really hamming it up ) and Rebecca's dad respectively , in addition to others like Joan Cusack and John Lithgow . The soundtrack provided extra lift too , with some of the latest pop acts contributing bubble gum tracks that will leave you tapping your feet to . Confessions of a Shopaholic treads a fine balance between fluffy entertainment and a film with a strong message of what really matters in a materialistic world like ours . Friends and family come first , in addition to an everyday careful examination of needs versus wants . Sure there's no need to watch the film , but you know you just want to . Enjoy this rom-com , and girls will find the numerous outfits here a thrill to drool over . At least those in my screening did !

Text2: Of late , musical biographies make popular films especially when they dish out anecdotes on the various ups and downs in the lifestyles of the rich and famous , and especially so when the music they play and the songs they sing happen to be evergreen classics , or at least those which you've probably heard before at one point in time . In recent years , Walk the Line and Ray have also garnered popular film awards , and not to mention raised the profiles of the stars like Joaquin Phoenix and Jamie Foxx respectively who played the musical legends . Unfortunately , La Vie En Rose was a little difficult to find a connection with , for shallow people like me . Edith Piaf was one of France's most famous singers , which no doubt counted towards the success of the movie when it premiered in France . But for the ahem younger generation that I belong to , the songs only sound remotely familiar . I'll be more in tune if you ask me about Alizee , but Edith Piaf , it's a different era altogether . However , that does not mean that the movie cannot be enjoyed , as it opens up your eyes ( and ears ) to a whole new musical world out there . Played by Marion Cotillard , you might do a double take because gone is that va-va-vroom lover opposite Russell Crowe in A Good Life , and in place , a transformed figure as the legendary singer . The movie traces the life of Edith Piaf , as a young child abandoned by her parents to live in a brothel , to surviving in the streets performing with her dad , and to life as a singing busker until she's discovered , and makes the stage her world . And as we bear witness to her tumultuous life , Cotillard becomes surprisingly chameleon like , thanks to the wonderful makeup , and her nuance performance as a character who has her periodic mood swings , shooting insults off the cuff , while maintaining her feisty selfishness to have things go her way . It's a biography that covered a wide spectrum , ambitiously wanting to cover all ground from her addiction to her career to her luckless in love romantic life , and at most times , seem scattered and all over the place . Characters get introduced and flit in and out of the narrative with nary a proper introduction , and those unfamiliar with her story , will find it a tad frustrating . Her brush with the Hollywood legends like Marlon Brando and Charlie Chaplin only gets mentioned in passing ( no big name cameos here , unlike that which was found in Scorsese's The Aviator ) , and only Marlene Dietrich got a one minute screen time to whet what possibly could come ( and not ) . The narrative structure too enhances your suffering by wanting to be unconventional and adopted the fractured timeline , but too much going backwards-forwards-sideways , sometimes opting to time stamp , while others tried feebly to fade in using artifacts , failed miserably . I believe that should it chose to be more conventional , and stuck to the boring chronological timeline in telling the story , it would have made even more fans for those unfamiliar with the legend . However , one thing's for sure , the songs in those days are lovely , par none . No technical pyrotechnics to jazz up and disguise a weak singer voice so possessed by many wannabes these days , singers from the era have just the music , meaningful lyrics , a microphone and a powerful voice to please fans and win over new ones . For me however , I'll stick to Alizee , thank you very much .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

As in these type of situations the topic of conversation soon got round to lamenting the demise of the British film industry . It may sound bitter but we all agreed that the reason was because the industry in this country is crippled by nepotism with people getting their movies financed simply because they know the right people , not because they have any obvious talent MAD COWS is a case in point . Apparently it's based on a novel by Australian Kathy Lette which probably explains how her husband Geoffry Robertson managed to get a walk on part in this movie . Robertson isn't a professional actor which means a member of Equity has been deprived of an income . Actually at least one other actor has also been deprived since Mohamed Al Fayed the owner of Harrods also appears in a walk on part . As for the actors who have paid their dues to Equity I wasn't impressed . Anna Friel spends the movie with an entirely unconvincing Aussie accent while Joanna Lumley is abysmal since she recreates her role as Patsy Stone from ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS The supporting cast I will reserve judgement on because I've a feeling that the director Sara Sugarman is more to blame than the actors themselves . A case in point is an interrogation by a detective who has arrested the heroine for stealing a packet of frozen peas ( A pathetic plot twist ? Glad you agree with me ) and my gut instinct is that the scene was hopelessly unfunny to begin with but instead of the director beating the screenwriter to death with a limp script Ms Sugarman has told the actor in question to put on a funny speech impediment and other clown mannerisms . No doubt the cast have nothing but kind words about working with Sara Sugerman but you don't make a movie to enjoy yourself - You make a movie to let the audience enjoy themself and there's no enjoyment here as we have to endure silly performances , MTV style direction in a very plot less and episodic story that is a kick in the guts to anyone who has struggled to make it in the movie business in this country But at least MAD COWS proves once and for all that it's not what you know in the British movie industry - It's who you know

That is basically what happens in this fun filled 1943 movie directed by Alan Dawn . We meet a group of actors and singers taking an around the world trip to keep up the morale of the combating soldiers . Featured prominently was Kay Kayser and his orchestra . Mr . Kayser was a man that felt good in front of the camera as well as conducting his orchestra and singers . Out of the talent in the film , the irresistible Joan Davis has the best opportunities . She was a funny lady with excellent timing , who could keep up with the best . Mischa Auer is also among the group of actors and singers accompanying Mr . Kayser in this world tour .

The story focuses on Jack Holloway who test flies a top secret plane ( stock footage of a real plane that is not called Storm Catcher ) and is framed for stealing it and hiding it in a hut out in the desert . Or something . The way the story develops is VERY clichéd although I never did see the "" twist "" coming so it kind of did succeed there . There are a few redeeming features . Like Mystro Clark as "" Sparks "" and there are 2 oddball special agents who crop up every now and again but serve no real purpose other than to look like Hugo Weaving from The Matrix . I tell ya , the resemblance is uncanny . The woman who plays Holloways wife is badly miscast ( and has found it difficult to get work since admitting her fondness of anal sex on the Howard Stern show ) although his daughter is a rather good actress . Director ( and Hugo Weaving lookalike ) Anthony Hickox insists on using hand-held cameras in scenes that don't them and steadicam on scenes that do . I don't know what his method or technique of film-making is but it sucks . The tagline is totally wrong too and gives you the impression that the story is going to build to a more satisfying climax . But it doesn't . Dolph is neither convicted nor is he sentenced so that is a huge lie . Watch this movie on TV but do NOT rent it and do NOT buy it like I did . Save your money for Dolph's best movie . . . Joshua Tree .

Imagine a fourty something woman zapping through the channels trying to find something to watch after a hard days work . What's on ? HAMBURGER HILL - A Vietnam war film . PLATOON - A Vietnam war film . FULL METAL JACKET - A Vietnam war film . BLACK HAWK DOWN - A movie not set in Vietnam and yes it's a war film . So Mrs fourty something comes to the conclusion that unless you like seeing human beings kill one another there's no point in subscribing to movie channels so therefore TV companies contribute to a very real market of movies where the main protagonist is female And I couldn't help thinking SUDDENLY is the most typical of these type of TVMs . Kirstie Alley plays Marty a woman who works in a diner and is just too sassy and fun loving to be true . You do get the impression that if she was miserable and introverted destiny would bless her with good health and a long life but as with all these other type of movies produced by TV companies bad things happen to nice women and she finds herself facing eternity in a wheelchair As you can imagine SUDDENLY plays out like you'd expect it to . There's a lot of bitterness from Marty , a romantic subplot , a really cute dog ( Though thankfully the romance doesn't involve the dog ) and a lecture on how to enjoy sex if you're a paraplegic . I do have to admit BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was much better but then again I'm a male who likes Vietnam war movies

Neither performance disappointed ( Remember this was made in 1981 when DeNiro was a God when it came to acting . How times change ) but the rest of the film did . I was under the impression that this was going to be very similar to LA CONFIDENTIAL and for brief spots the movie hints it's heading in that direction with its subplot of the murder of a prostitute and pornography but there's far too many slow talky scenes with static direction and there seems to be a subtext of catholic guilt in there somewhere which will probably confuse anyone who didn't attend a catholic school as a child .

The film has a faded look , as one watches it today , but still , it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principals . If you haven't seen it , please don't read any further . Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds . Chris went to enter a seminary to be a priest , but gives up . Daulton became a small time drug user and trafficker . The two lives seem to run parallel as the pair become involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short sightedness . In fact , it shows how both young men miscalculate in their attempt to fool the CIA and the Soviet Union . These two , in a way , were so naive in thinking they could pull something that bigger , and better equipped people couldn't even imagine could be done . Chris ' motivation is legitimate , as he feels outraged in discovering the underhanded role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations , in this case Australia , something he finds by sheer coincidence . When he involves Daulton , we know the whole thing is doomed because no one into drugs , as he is , will ever amount to anything . In fact , Chris and Daulton had no conception of the scope of what they are trying to do , or its consequences . Timothy Hutton was at this period of his career , an actor that was going places . He had proved he had talent with his work in other films , so it was a natural choice for Mr . Schlesinger to select him , a choice that pays off well . Sean Penn , also was a young actor who showed an intensity , like one hadn't seen before . In fact , at times , Mr . Penn , reminded us of a young Robert Mitchum in the making . Both actors ' contribution to the film is incredible . One can't think who could have played this duo but them . "" The Falcon and the Snowman "" , while not up to the par with other great John Schlesinger's movies , is an interesting look to our not too distant past .

This is an enjoyable little film , despite the fact that Disney used the same basic plot - Donald versus a tiny creature - many times . Buzz-Buzz appeared in seven Disney cartoons - much to Donald's intense discomfiture - from 1948 until 1952 . Clarence "" Ducky "" Nash supplies Donald's voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

207,"Text1: Edward Parker ( Richard Arlen ) , the sole survivor of a shipwreck , ends up stuck on an uncharted , unnamed island that is the domain of one Dr . Moreau ( Charles Laughton ) . With the reluctant assistance of lackey Montgomery ( Arthur Hohl ) , Moreau has been playing God in the classic tradition of mad scientists everywhere : he is turning animals into humans , keeping his creations in check with a "" House of Pain "" and a strict set of laws . The 1930's horror era may have been mostly ruled by Universal , but this offering from Paramount , the first of a few screen adaptations of the H . G . Wells novel , is a most noteworthy exception . It retains a power to chill and captivate viewers all these years later . The overall effect of seeing these botched experiments , whom it is hard not to feel pity for , is a disturbing one indeed . Calling to my mind the later "" King Kong "" , the island setting offers a stark and foreboding atmosphere . Laughton , whose offbeat appearance he claims to have been inspired by his own dentist ( ! ) , dominates the proceedings with a flamboyantly wicked performance . Arlen is a little bland in comparison but it is all too easy to share his characters ' indignation at what he is witnessing . Hohl is solid in support as the weary Montgomery , with co-star Bela Lugosi completely unrecognizable ( save for that distinctive voice ) under heavy makeup as the "" Sayer of the Law "" , making the most of what is not really a very big part . Debuting Kathleen Burke , as Lota the Panther Woman , is quite striking . The grim and nasty finale must have indeed been very daring for the time in which this was made ; although nothing is technically shown , the fact of what is suggested makes for a memorable demise for our misguided antagonist . Not without some humor , "" Island of Lost Souls "" is still first and foremost a potent and eerie shocker that's still got plenty of juice 76 years after its theatrical release . Featuring makeup effects that are simply excellent , the feelings that this movie leaves me with are too powerful to ignore . One final word : this needs a DVD release , much sooner than later .

Text2: The final edition of ' Six Dates With Barker ' was a rare excursion by Ronnie Barker ( he wrote it under his ' Gerald Wiley ' alias ) into science fiction . It is 2774 A . D . A head of state lays dying . A physician arrives to tend to his final needs . He makes his entrance by jumping through a circus-style hoop , before executing a Billy Dainty-style funny dance . The viewing masses roar with laughter . Yes , we are in a bizarre future where comedy has become the new religion . Instead of The Father , The Son & The Holy Ghost , it is Chaplin , Keaton , and W . C . Fields . No-one is allowed to be serious anymore . People greet one another by thumbing their noses . A banana skin graces the national flag . When Prince Boffo ( Ronnie Barker ) weeps for his dead father , the viewers at home are mystified . When he questions the status quo , his wife reports him to the authorities , who decree he be re-indoctrinated to regain his sense of humour . He must face the Arch Funster . . . If you went to the cinema in the early ' 70's to see a science fiction film , chances were you would be confronted with the likes of ' A Clockwork Orange ' , ' No Blade Of Grass ' , ' The Final Programme ' , ' Soylent Green ' and ' Zardoz ' , all of which predicted doomy futures for the Human Race . It is a little surprising to see a half-hour sitcom on the same theme . ' Stooge ' depicts a nightmarish world , with everyone constantly cracking jokes , and an air of forced joviality in place at all times . Michael Hordern makes a guest appearance as the ' Arch Funster ' , a cross between Bob Monkhouse and Groucho Marx . The actor had previously worked with Barker on the silent film comedy ' Futtock's End ' . Lesley-Anne Down , who plays Prince Boffo's daughter ' Cheeky ' , went on to the period drama ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' as the annoying ' Georgina Worsley ' . The author's message is obvious ; only by being serious can we ever hope to measure the joy of laughter . Like the ' Galton & Simpson Playhouse ' episode ' Variations On A Theme ' , this should be regarded as a piece of experimental comedy , an attempt to do something other than what was the norm for I . T . V . comedy at the time . I cannot say for sure but my guess is that it probably baffled audiences . It makes its point fairly quickly , and then has nowhere to go . Perhaps the idea would have worked more effectively in sketch form . A similar premise appeared on ' Dr . Who ' in 1988 - ' The Happiness Patrol ' starring Sylvester McCoy . Funniest moment - Prince Boffo's re-indoctrination , in which he has to supply the punchlines to the Arch Funster's incredibly corny jokes . If it failed to offend anyone of a certain religious faith at the time , then I would be most surprised . Of course when this was written old school comedy was still around . Just imagine an updated version , featuring a world in which people worshipped ' The Mighty Boosh ' . Doesn't bear thinking about , does it ?","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Though penned by Brian Cooke , one half of the writing team behind ' Man About The House ' and ' George & Mildred ' , they proved about as funny as anthrax . The show cast Rossiter as ' Norman Tripper ' , the permanently harassed manager of a supermarket whose staff are either lazy or incompetent . Typical of the show's level of humour is the fact that two characters are named ' Laurel ' and ' Hardy ' so that Tripper can make a reference to ' Laurel & Hardy ' the comedy duo . As Tripper , its easily Rossiter's least distinguished comedy performance , though this is not his fault . Tripper comes across as a weak ' Basil Fawlty ' clone , constantly shouting his not very funny lines to no avail . Midway through the transmission of this series , Rossiter passed away , making ' Tripper's Day ' his last ever work for television . Shame . He deserved a better epitaph than this .

Text2: Though ' The Avengers ' ended in 1969 , repeats kept on coming on I . T . V . ( in my part of the world at least ) until 1972 . Some lucky regions got them as late as 1975 , mostly of the colour Rigg and Thorson episodes , good news for anyone who had recently upgraded their television sets . In 1976 , ' The New Avengers ' appeared . Patrick Macnee returned as ' Steed ' , with Joanna Lumley as ' Purdey ' and Gareth Hunt as ' Mike Gambit ' . Many felt the concept of a trio damaged the show , leaving little room for the kind of romantic chemistry Macnee had earlier enjoyed with his co-stars . I personally feel that it was a necessary move , especially seeing how Macnee was in his fifties when the show was made . ' The Eagle's Nest ' opened the series . A British agent named George Stannard is being chased across open country by fishermen whose rods have poisoned hooks . He seeks sanctuary in a monastery , but the monks stand by and watch him being led away . Whilst being interrogated , he makes a break for it , and speeds away from the island in a boat . A hook catches him across his right cheek , and he dies . Steed arrives at Stannard's London flat , only to be attacked . He gives chase , but ever the gallant gentlemen stops to help an old lady find her dog . He calls Gambit , requesting he consult Purdey . As she and Stannard had been lovers , it is thought she might have knowledge of his present whereabouts . The trail eventually leads to the remote Scottish island of St . Dorca . Steed turns up posing as a tourist , while Purdey sneaks in unannounced . Back in London , Gambit chases the kidnapper of the noted German cryobiologist Von Claus . He catches up with him , but the man takes his own life . Oddly , he is wearing a hairpiece , the crown of his head is shaved , like a monk's . . . I will leave the synopsis here . Suffice it to say , the episode has little of the flavour of the original series , coming across more like a ' Freewheelers ' adventure . From the pre-credits scene you immediately know its not the ' 60's anymore . Laurie Johnson's music is very much of its time , Steed does not have his Bentley , and the elegance and charm that endeared ' The Avengers ' to millions is all but gone . As ' Steed ' , Macnee is as impeccable as ever , Joanna Lumley's ' Purdey ' was the best ' Avengers ' girl since ' Mrs . Peel ' , and ' Gambit ' , while his character was never developed as well as it should , gave a fresh look to the show . As ' Von Claus ' , Peter Cushing made his second ' Avengers ' appearance . He had earlier played ' Paul Beresford ' in ' Return Of The Cybernauts ' . Anticipating being criticised for stereotyping the German people as heel-clicking Nazis , Clemens deliberately made a good German the pivot of the story . The premise of Hitler in suspended animation was hokey even then , but it is executed with some panache here . Not showing us Hitler's actual face was a wise move . The main villainy is provided by Derek Farr as ' Father Trasker ' . I . T . V . ' s trailer relied heavily on clips from this episode , such as Purdey's fight , Gambit's car chase , and Steed saying ' Rule Britannia ! ' when discovered by the Nazi monks . It had the unintended side-effect of making this look like a repeat even on the first run . Critics were divided . Brian Lawrence of ' The News Of The World ' called it ' great entertainment ' while Peter Phillips of ' The Sun ' thought it ' did not deserve a slot even on children's television ' . Phillips ' harsh view was echoed by many ' Sun ' readers . They felt that the show was a lot of ' childish comedy , with stereotypical situations ' . What had happened was that other more realistic thriller shows such as ' The Sweeney ' and ' Starsky & Hutch ' had come along , and Steed and co . looked ridiculous by comparison . Nevertheless , ' The Eagle's Nest ' reached number eight in the Top Ten most watched programmes of the week ( not bad for a non-networked show ) , and eventually the public grew to like ' The New Avengers ' .

I think he's a great actor but this is the movie to see him in as it's A . His best performance and B . One of the best villains ever in movies . Judgment Night kind of comes across as a modern , urban Deliverance . There are many similarities between them but Judgment Night clearly has more excitement . Estevez , Gooding Jnr , Piven and Dorff play well off each other and Piven especially seems to really get into the whiny runt of his character . Leary plays Fallon , a dangerous criminal from Chicago's bad side . And when the four pals cross him and witness a murder carried out by him a chase across derelict landscapes follows . Peter Greene , an actor I always like to see , plays Sykes , one of Fallon's cohorts as well as Everlast from the rap group House of Pain as Rhodes . They sure do make a threatening impression . Director Stephen Hopkins ( who also did Predator 2 and Blown Away ) uses creeping camera movements and neo-noir lighting to provoke multiple eerie moments as well as a great deal of tension . Slow-mo and warped sound effects are also used to great effect in the finale . The DVD by Universal massively improves on the old release by Goodtimes .

211,"Text1: Mexican writer / director Leopoldo Laborde has made a number of low budget , challenging , controversial films , using his cadre of nonprofessional actors and crew and he is gathering a following for his courage and his unique style . SIN DESTINO is a good introduction to his work - a film about the seamy side of Mexico City's life told with verismo style that at times is difficult to watch but yet one that succeeds in conveying his story well . Using a combination of black and white with intervals of color photography , SIN DESTINO follows the life of a fifteen-year old Francisco / Frank ( Francisco Rey ) who has been a sex worker since his desperate introduction to the desires of older men when he was nine years old . He regularly engages in same sex activity for money to pay for a drug habit that is out of control . His friend and dealer is the understanding David ( David Valdez ) who ' loans ' Frank money and coke when Frank is desperate , but also feels the need to get Frank out of the sex market by introducing him to women : David believes that once Frank has sex with a woman he will forego his street ways and have a chance at life . Frank happens to view a blonde girl Angelica ( Mariana Gaja ) and for the first time feels attraction to women . David sets Frank up with a kind-hearted prostitute Perla ( Sylvia Vilchis ) who offers Frank understanding and tenderness even though Frank is unable to perform . Frank has disturbing dreams and visions of his initial initiation into the male hustler life by an older child pornographer Sebastian ( Roberto Cobo ) and these intensely ugly memories are mixed with his delusions of sexual encounters with Angelica : these scenes appear in color and make a fine contrast in the ' magical realism ' vein . David encourages Frank to bed Angelica and sells him ( through money he will retrieve from an incidental reunion with Sebastian ) a love potion that will assure his sexual success with Angelica . Frank visits Sebastian after a six-year absence , obtains the money through violent means , and has his desired hook up with Angelica that results in a cruel tragedy that completes the film . David remains at Frank's side through the sequelae that follow and the film ends on a dark note that all but extinguishes Frank's hope for a favorable destiny . Laborde knows what he wants and opts for a crude , rough , seemingly spontaneous non-rehearsed style of acting from his crew . He is able to draw from Francisco Rey an empathetic character , a lad who is stuck in the quagmire of the slim that faces the poor kids of the big city . Laborde is even able to make his ' evil johns ' such as Sebastian more than simply dark caricatures . His cinematographer Jorge Rubio Casarín is at all times in sync with Laborde's vision , even though the camera use is inordinately distracting with its play of light and dark at times . It is only after the film is over that Laborde's use of the fate , death and love potion motifs from Wagner's ' Tristan und Isolde ' are appreciated , and that is an example of how much energy the writer / director has in his visions , a trait that suggests he may become a significant force in Mexican film-making . The film contains considerable violence , nudity , simulated sex scenes , drug use and harsh language , but one cannot imagine this story being told without those elements .

Text2: I remember the first time that I saw First Blood , I thought it was going to be a typical silly action movie , but it turned into one of the best action movies I had seen . I remember hearing about the Rambo sequel which was at the time titled "" John Rambo "" with "" Rocky Balboa "" , I saw Rocky and was very disappointed , so I was assuming the same was going to be with Rambo . But after some promising reviews , I went ahead and saw it today and this is seriously the best action movie in years . I couldn't believe how incredible this movie was , it was brutal , terrifying , but had a great story . Sylvester Stallone still has it , and is incredible , I can't believe how great he looked and how he still hasn't lost his edge . The reason why this movie worked is because I think he really understands John Rambo , this movie could have never worked without his touch . John Rambo lives in Vietnam as a guide of the river , he makes a living collecting snakes for a sport for the villagers . There is a huge war going on , a civil war , where the Vietnamese are brutally killing villagers if not taking their boys and making them into soldiers , and violently raping their women . When a peace group who is convinced that they will change everyone's ways asks John to bring them into the war , they go into more than they expected when they are captured . John has to go back into action to save their lives and bring them back home safely . Rambo is seriously the best film that I have seen so far in 2008 , the only thing that was disturbing to me is that the civil war is not far from the truth at all and how brutal it was , but it was nice to have a good guy to root for and have hope that some people can regain their faith in the goodness in people . I was thinking today how weird it is , this is a genuine action movie , the one people have been waiting for years to have , and it took the old school to bring back that exciting feeling . I highly recommend Rambo , believe me , this is an excellent movie and I can't wait to have it on video .

Charlton Heston is the financial manager and boss of the traveling tent-show , yet , aside from some monetary disputes at the beginning , we aren't told very much about the money-end of the show or how the performers spend their checks on their down time ( do they have off-season lives at all ? ) . DeMille is also uninterested in the freaky end of carny life - - to him it's all in the family - - though he does touch upon the corruption of the midway and some of the back-biting amongst the starlets . A little trimming might've made the picture more immediate ( some of the parades go on too long , and I would've cut Dorothy Lamour's Hawaiian number , though it contains a surprise cameo which gets a big laugh ) . Betty Hutton , who sings like a brick , must be the most masochistic trapeze chanteuse who ever defied death , but Gloria Grahame is fun as a wisecracking elephant assistant and Heston strikes an appropriately no-nonsense stance which , while largely wooden , works for this picture . As for James Stewart as Buttons the Clown , he's supposed to be a little mysterious , a question mark , but DeMille and his editor cut to Stewart far too often and he's on-screen far too much ( they want to make sure we don't miss a trick , such is the way the unsubtle drama is mechanically laid out ) .

Text2: Michael Ironside certainly wasn't the type of guy you wanted to add to your list of enemies back in the early 80's ! He spontaneously caused people's heads to explode in "" Scanners "" and he's an even bigger monster here in "" Visiting Hours "" , as he gives image to a reticent yet malevolent & misogynistic killer who can't accept that one of his target victims survives in the hospital . The victim we're referring to is Deborah Ballin ; TV-show hostess and strong activist for women's rights everywhere . Following another one of her much talked-about shows , Colt Hawker perpetrates the house and assaults her , but he doesn't finish the job properly . Then , despite of the huge police and media attention given to the case , he goes to the hospital and kills everyone who stands between him and Deborah , including nurses and unfortunate patients . "" Visiting Hours "" is a peculiar 80's slasher that doesn't get much appreciation from either critics or regular horror fans . Personally , I have no idea why because this movie is extremely creepy and director Jean-Claude Lord professionally spreads the suspense throughout the entire film even though we instantly know about the maniac's identity and what his motivations are . The screenplay spends quite a lot of time enlightening us about Hawker's private life and childhood traumas through brief flashback-sequences , making "" Visiting Hours "" some sort of crossover between John Carpenter's "" Halloween "" ( with a knife-wielding maniac butchering innocent people ) and no less than Martin Scorsese's "" Taxi Driver "" ( with the complex sociopath background of the culprit ) . This combination isn't always successful or 100 % plausible , but at least it provides a more or less original slasher setting since these flicks usually just involve high school teenagers or summer campers . J . C . Lord creates tension through eerie POV-shots and bone-chilling music ( courtesy of Jonathon Goldsmith ) and the murders are pleasingly bloody , albeit a bit mundane . "" Visiting Hours "" is probably one of the ONLY 80's slashers that is occasionally able to really scare you , so I'm more than willing to look past most of the flaws . And yes , there undeniably are some obvious flaws . Like some other reviewers righteously pointed out already , there's a problem with both the editing and continuity . The killer ? as well as the other characters ? seems to move from one place to another very fast . One moment he's observing a nurse in her backyard and the next he's walking around the hospital fully disguised in a doctor's coat . Also , the cops guarding the hospital aren't very useful since Hawker hasn't got the least problem of walking in and out of there without having to show identification . Finally , I'm not entirely sure what Sheila's ( Linda Purl ) profession is . Is she just a nurse covering night shifts or a fully degreed doctor ? If she's a nurse , then where are all the doctors ? Most of the film takes place inside a hospital ? duh ? yet there seem to be only two nurses working there . Then again , the acting performances are another good aspect . Ironside is excellent and genuinely petrifying as the silent psychopath and the two female leads ( Lee Grant & Linda Purl ) are very convincing in their roles of hunted preys . Oh , Captain Kirk also stars , but his character is about as useful as non-alcoholic beverages at a graduation party .

The dialogue is hilariously vulgar and self-conscious , and the girls ' locker room sequence ( filled with naked babes - - as if this were a women-in-prison flick ) provides just about the final word in exploitive cat fight scenes . The tone wavers from campy juvenalia to psychotic melodrama , and the extreme violence ( as well as the rape scene ) is tough to stomach .

Text2: In the 1950's , a quiet but quick-thinking young man who postures like James Dean stirs up trouble for a simple young girl living with her father ; he eventually takes her on a journey across several states by car , leaving dead bodies in their wake . Dreamy , somewhat vacuous ( and intentionally so ) drama by debuting director Terrence Malick was based on a real-life case , one which probably bears no resemblance to this film . The two main characters aren't shaped : they're blobby malcontents who don't even have a plan , they go where the wind takes them . There's a surge of excitement in their initial escape , and the two are viewed as romantic misfits even though there's not much romance between them . This was obviously exactly what Malick intended , but the viewer can't really get a grip on this story ; it's shapeless and blobby too . The low-keyed action and ( amusingly ) droning narration by Sissy Spacek makes the whole thing seem like a non-event , and yet the performances by Martin Sheen and Spacek are highly controlled and interesting . We're probably not meant to be moved by either of these two , but Sheen's joshing confrontation with some officers is incredibly bracing , and his acting in general is raw without ever seeming showy or amateurish . The background score ( with a theme that sounds like jewelry box music that keeps getting louder and stronger ) is evocative and spooky , and the film's ambiance is intriguing - - but neither makes the film very compelling or memorable . The loose narrative slips in and around what we're seeing , as if there wasn't a proper script , and the impression is that the filmmaker was relying strictly on externals . from","{""output"": ""YES""}"
215,"Text1: This movie has an extremely realistic feeling and provides a view on a child-murderer and the effect it has on the normal everyday society of Germany in 1930 . It's one of the most chilling movies I have ever seen along with movies like "" Psycho "" and "" Se7en "" . The storytelling in this movie is extremely good . It's slow but it perfectly captures the fear and desperate feelings . Because everything in the movie feels so realistic , it gets a chilling atmosphere . This is also thanks to the at times phenomenal camera-work , directing and the child-murderer part that's played by Peter Lorre . In my opinion his character is just as chilling and classic as Hannibal Lecter . Director Fritz Lang already proved his talent with "" Metropolis "" in 1927 . This is his first movie that also uses sound but he still manages to put in , just as many visual style and groundbreaking moments in this movie , as he did in his early silent movie works . This is one of the very first film-noir's ever created and this movie helped to set the standards for later movies in the same genre . Truly a milestone in movie history . The directing is really top-class and so is the cinematography from Fritz Arno Wagner who is also known for working on the classic German expressionist horror masterpiece "" Nosferatu , eine Symphonie des Grauens "" . The combination of both provide some highly original and memorable scene's . The acting is silly over-the-top at times as often was still the case in German movies from the ' 30's . It's also obvious that German isn't Peter Lorre's native language . His German is just a bit off at times . A classic powerful , chilling , atmospheric , stylish masterpiece that I can whole heartedly recommend to everyone .

My initial thought was that it might be some sort of "" wave the flag , isn't the military great , wouldn't you like to join the Air Force "" movie . But that can't be right . This thing is too deadly dull to inspire anyone to run out and enlist . Similar movies from the 40s , even though they were often as sappy as could be , at least provided some entertainment with their propaganda . That's not the case here . I defy anyone to find anything remotely entertaining in The Starfighters . I suppose there is some curiosity value in seeing a young B-1 Bob Dornan attempting to act , but I can't imagine watching this thing just to see the former congressman . I also defy anyone to watch The Starfighters without the aid of MST3K . Even these guys ran out of steam during the second , extended , monotonous , in-flight refueling scene . Usually , regardless of how bad a movie is , there are those who find something to enjoy and write reviews on IMDb supporting some facet of the movie . That doesn't appear to be true with The Starfighters . I went through both pages of reviews on IMDb and didn't notice anyone with a positive comment or a rating higher than a for the Starfighters . It's just that bad ! That reminds me , I haven't even mentioned the plot . But there's a reason . The plot in The Starfighters doesn't really matter .

If that weren't enough , he has an old , washed-up doctor in the basement who , unbeknownst to Lugosi , is doing experiments on reanimating dead bodies . With all of this going on , there are really very few dull moments in the movie's short runtime . I suppose that's also part of the movie's biggest problem ? there are too many loose ends and too many plot threads that go nowhere . For example , why and how is the Doc creating the zombies ? And how is the process seemingly reversed at the end of the movie ? It's probably best not to think too much about it and just enjoy the movie for what it is .

This also causes Jessica to exhibit bizarre behavior before finally showing the signs of demonic possession . Laying aside the similarities to "" The Exorcist "" - levitation , regurgitation of thick green stuff , head twists , deep demonic voice - which caused Warner Bros . to take legal action , I thought this was mildly amusing in its own right . It features some incredibly crazy , head-scratching , W . T . F . moments , some worthy of big laughs . One memorably silly sequence takes place about an hour and a quarter along , but it goes on for too long and becomes annoying quickly . The problem for me is that the good moments come too infrequently . Sure , it's creepy at times , and Mills and especially Johnson are good . But it takes about three quarters of an hour before anything remotely interesting happens . The movie is just too protracted and could have used a little shot of adrenaline . Still , I liked the touch of Old Scratch himself actually being heard addressing Dimitri . The music score was quite intriguing , in any event , far from being the typical horror movie score .

Text2: Aliens come to Earth with the intention of taking over , trusting that humans will surrender peacefully . When they are met with the expected barrage of gunfire ( an earlier attempt at communication had been unsuccessful ) , the aliens change tactics promptly , attacking en masse . It's up to granite-jawed heroic scientist Russell Marvin ( Hugh Marlowe ) to help the military save the day . As one might expect , it's the special effects of legendary stop-motion master Ray Harryhausen that take center stage . He pulls off some great scenes here , especially the destruction of real-life monuments for the rousing finish . The nighttime sequence is also quite well done . Even working against the constraints of a low budget , Mr . Harryhausen delivers the goods . The withered , leathery look of the aliens ( we get to see one unmasked very briefly ) is another striking plus . Directed with typical efficiency by Fred F . Sears , an extremely prolific B director of the era , the movie edgily and steadily moves towards the inevitable final confrontation . There's much exposition to deliver - as was common for these movies , there's an ever-present narrator to explain everything to us , with much technical detail for us to digest . Filled with actors who were commonly seen in the 50's low-budget efforts - ever-present Morris Ankrum , Donald Curtis ( who also acted in the earlier Harryhausen - Charles H .

I was intrigued by the method employed by the aliens at one point : they cause an explosion on the surface of the sun , which causes extreme weather to occur back on Earth . Too bad this concept couldn't have been exploited a little more , but I understand the need to keep the pacing of the film consistent , as the movie is definitely picking up steam by this point .

Rourke plays Randy the Ram Robinson ( real name Robin , but don't call him that ) , a professional wrestling has-been , relegated to third-tier matches in out-of-the-way towns , attended by a smattering of fans who still remember who he is . After a particularly brutal and gimmicky match involving barbed wire , glass and a nail gun , he suffers a heart attack and undergoes bypass surgery . Faced with the prospect of not ever being able to wrestle again ( which to that point has been his whole life ) , he decides to reconnect with his estranged daughter ( Evan Rachel Wood , effective in a few brief scenes ) and makes romantic overtures to a woman who works at his favorite strip joint ( Marisa Tomei ) . Much of "" The Wrestler "" feels like a documentary about the behind-the-scenes workings of professional wrestling , or more accurately , about what happens to professional wrestlers after they're spit out of the entertainment mill . We see Randy locked out of his trailer when he can't muster the rent and begging for more hours at the supermarket where he works . He's the Norma Desmond of the wrestling world , waiting patiently at autograph signings barely attended by anybody , carting around VHS tapes of his professional highlights to sell to anyone who might still actually own a VCR . He's a relic from the 1980s , as illustrated in a wonderful scene in which he and Tomei discuss those good ' ol days and the great bands they produced , until Kurt Cobain came along and ruined everything . Rourke plays Randy as a gentle giant , whose tender and warm way with people belies his fierce professional persona . He gives a marvelous performance , achingly sad but not maudlin . This is pretty much his movie entirely ; Tomei and Wood each get a few moments to shine , but Rourke holds the screen and doesn't let it go . The only thing that marred this movie for me was its ending . Most of the movie is completely lacking any of the phony Hollywood trappings that mar so many other movies . Therefore , the "" Rocky "" - style ending , with Randy's true love racing the clock to get to his match on time , and us left wondering whether or not he's going to drop dead of a heart attack right in the middle of his big moment , felt like a cheat .

KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE [ 1953 ] and QUENTIN DURWARD [ 1955 ] ) , Warners somewhat incongruously assigned musical comedy expert Butler to this one ! While clearly inferior to those three films , KING RICHARD AND THE CRUSADERS isn't nearly as bad as its reputation would suggest ( though it must be said that most spectacles from this era , disregarded by the majority of critics when new , stand up surprisingly well today as entertainment ! ) . Even so , there's some definite campiness to the film ? notably when Rex Harrison as Saladin lullabies George Sanders , playing the wounded King Richard ( the score by reliable Max Steiner being noteworthy apart from this ) ? and , in any case , the whole emerges to be even more fanciful than Cecil B . De Mille's THE CRUSADES ( 1935 ; which preceded this viewing ) , what with the Muslim leader insinuating himself into the enemy camp , providing a cure for the King , and even aiding him in routing the traitors ( genre staple Robert Douglas and Michael Pate ) among his own ranks ! ! One similarity to the earlier epic is the fact that Saladin falls for a Christian woman ? though , in this case , it's Richard's cousin ( Virginia Mayo ) as opposed to his wife ( who gets very limited screen time here ) ? but ultimately relinquishes the heroine to her lover ( a fiery Scots knight played by a young , blonde yet surprisingly effective Laurence Harvey ) . Incidentally , Sanders ? while older than Henry Wilcoxon's incarnation of Richard in THE CRUSADES ? is no less gruff and headstrong and , in fact , spends more time fighting Harvey ( including a jousting duel ) than Harrison ! !

The star , then , is supported by a most excellent cast : Angela Lansbury ( a fine actress but a rather unlikely chanteuse ) , James Bell ( a usurped town leader ) , Jean Parker ( an ageing belle and the latter's wife ) , Wallace Ford ( predictably in the role of the reliable town doctor ) , Ruth Donnelly ( as Scott's gracious elderly housekeeper ) , Jeanette Nolan ( as the wife of a revenge-seeking ex-con whom Scott has killed in self-defense ) , and an interesting trio of villains ? powerful boss Warner Anderson ( who also fancies himself a ladies ' man and , in fact , strikes up relationships with both Parker and Lansbury throughout ) , shifty but nervous gambler John Emery and smooth gunslinger Michael Pate ( making for a worthy opponent to Scott ) . The above-average script by Kenneth Gamet ( an in-joke shows the calendar in the hero's room as being sponsored by Gamet's Vegetable Compound ! ) gives characterization reasonable depth : Scott and Lansbury are married but she had left him because of his dangerous job ( a situation which she has to live through again now ) ; Scott tells Donnelly that he hears The Beast ( which symbolizes the scourge of the town ) every morning until it's replaced by church-bells at the end of the picture . The highlights ? most of the action seems to take place in and around one particular saloon , though in a montage we're shown that Anderson's ' protection ' extends to many others in town ? include an energetic and brutal fistfight between the hero and a dim-witted giant ( who subsequently joins forces with him ) , an astonishing shoot-out two-thirds of the way involving Scott and Pate which ends with the former left for dead , and the splendid extended climax . On top of it all is the pleasing cinematography by an expert in color lensing , Ray Rennahan .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

In the 1950's Elia Kazan name called film actors who he claimed were Communists before a Senate Hearing and became very unpopular in Hollywood , however , he still produced many great films and this was one of them . Karl Malden , ( Archie Lee Meighan ) , "" Patton "" , ' 70 , played a worn out drunken cotton mill owner who lost his business and some how managed to get himself a very young bride who he was not allowed to make love to until she was 20 years of age .

Text2: Ever heard of the saying ' ignorance is bliss ' ? Well , apparently , Peter Hyams hasn't . Despite his own ignorance , he feels that we should be told a thin explanation of everything of the first AND the second film . Despite the first film being visual and symbolic , this tries to simplify every single little thing in the first through basic , I - told - you - there - was - a - simple - explanation - to - it Scooby Doo-like explaining . Why apply cold logic when the first did so well without it ? Hyams tries to tell the story in a smart and funny way . . . failing terribly on both accounts . The guy who brought us the insipid Timecop and the plain awful Sudden Death once again manages to underwhelm us with his unbelievably stupid and quite unneeded explanation for everything that happened in the first . The film never caught my interest , even though I was quite intrigued to hear of a sequel to the visually stunning masterpiece 2001 : A Space Odyssey . The plot is dull and moves too slow . The pacing is just bad . The acting is not impressive in the slightest . The characters are poorly written and paper-thin . The film just screams ' Hollywood ' from the top of it's lungs , and reeks of it from every single orifice . The language-barrier between the Americans and the Russians is nearly non-existent . The film throws in numerous completely pointless characters that could easily have been removed without impacting the film in the slightest , top of which must be that endlessly annoying kid . The film rationalizes and explains away everything that was interesting in the first . I really didn't see any point for this sequel at all . I urge any fan of the first to avoid it , as it may very well destroy your fond memories of the first . Don't go near this one . I recommend this only to those who watched the first and didn't like the way everything was left a mystery , who wanted to have all of it explained .

228,"Text1: I didn't expect much from Deterrence to begin with ( it was recommended to me by someone with consistently ridiculous taste in movies - no offense to him , of course ) , but I was still disappointed . First of all , the entire movie takes place in a diner in some town in the middle of nowhere . As a film student , I realize how expensive it is to move to different locations ( or even just be ON location ) , to travel with an entire movie crew , and even that just to move a camera to a different angle could take all day and be very costly . But you need to keep in mind that in order to make a convincing "" political thriller , "" at least SOME of this needs to be done . I mean , there wasn't even a single SHOT that was not taken in this diner ( at least none that weren't borrowed from previous news footage ) . Besides that , the acting wasn't great . Timmothy Hutton was the only actor in the film of any consequence , and he delivered the only really good performance of anyone in the entire film . Kevin Pollack put forth a good effort as the inexperienced and overloaded new President , but he was terribly miscast . No matter how many people came before him in the order of assuming the Presidency , no one as short and bald as him would have generated much respect from the American people . I know that this is a prejudicial thing to say , but it's true . The American public does not respect a President AS MUCH if he ( or she , someday ) is not tall , good looking , full head of hair , etc . Appearance is extremely important , and Kevin Pollack doesn't have much of it . ( spoilers ) That little element bothered me , but I am more than willing to overlook it in the interest of enjoying the film . However , there are certain things that I absolutely will not overlook . The cook's suicide , for example . You have the stereotypical , uneducated black man working the grill in some hole-in-the-wall diner , yet he seems to be very intelligent . After attempting to voice his opinion to the President about dropping the bomb , he is rudely interrupted and entirely ignored . When it seems that the bomb will inevitably be dropped , he KILLS himself . What the hell is that all about ? ! Is that a subliminal message being sent out to the public ? You can't change what the government does , so if you don't like it , suicide is surely the only answer . This suicide was completely unnecessary to the story and was thrown in for no other reason than to have a couple of deaths in the film , as well as to kill the only guy who knew the codes to drop the bomb . The makers of Deterrence clearly did not blow much of their budget on writers . Even though every part of the film that did not take place in the diner was conducted over the phone , Deterrence clearly tries extremely hard to stimulate the emotions of the audience , but the simplicity of the story and the quickly thrown together script reduce the film to bottom-shelf drivel that will very soon be forgotten . President Emerson not only made the offensive decision entirely too early ( it was clear that he would drop the bomb within the first half hour of the film ) , he also ignored the advice of his personal staff for the vast majority of the film . This is boring , boring stuff . I was not even moved the tiniest bit when the bomb was dropped and Baghdad ( the civilization where civilization began ) was completely destroyed , along with everyone in it . Way too simple , not at all convincing , and routinely directed , Deterrence plays like a book being read to the audience . Everything is implied , suggested , vicariously explained , and entirely without effect .

Problem is Packard is in prison . They're going to sneak Tony in so he can do the job . The plot is pretty straightforward but this movie gives some characters astonishing names , throws in VERY 60s designs and clothes , tons of unfunny lines and plot twists to show how "" with it "" the directors and such were . This was made when old Hollywood was at a loss at what attracted teenagers to movies like "" Easy Rider "" . So they got all these old directors and actors and wrote scripts that were totally abysmal and made zero sense ( old Hollywood thought "" Easy Rider "" was pointless - - it isn't ) . This is one of those movies . What's wrong with it ? Where to start ? It's impossible to list everything that happens in this train wreck ( worse than Britney Spears ) but here are a few high and low lights : Carol Channing trying to seduce Frankie Avalon ; God trying to seduce young teenage Darlene ; tons of dated dialogue showing how peaceful and loving hippies are ( sigh ) ; John Phillip Law playing a hippie named Stash - - he deserves credit for keeping a straight face while giving out the most nonsensical dialogue ever heard in a movie ; the great George Raft reduced to playing a skipper on a boat ; Gleason having an LSD trip which is a true jaw dropper ; Richard Kiel as a prison guard ; Law giving a code message over the phone ( OK - - THAT scene is great ! ) ; an entire prison spaced out on LSD ; Burgess Meredith as a warden ; Peter Lawford as a senator ( figures - - he was married to a Kennedy ) and a Garbage Pail number which will have you questioning your sanity . There's more but those hit me . The acting - - well who can tell ? The movie is all over the place . Still Gleason is actually pretty good and Channing chews the scenery . Marx ( in his last theatrical role ) was , sadly , pretty terrible as God . He doesn't even get any jokes to crack ! The movie goes barreling over the edge at the end with Channing singing the title song ( which is admittedly pretty catchy ) and ALL the closing credits are sung ! This is a one of a kind motion picture . Yeah it's terrible - - a bunch of older actors / producers / directors trying ( in vain ) to prove how "" hip "" they are . Still , you can't stop watching and I was never bored for one minute . I just sat there in amazement watching the movie unfold . Truly a camp classic and a 10 all the way ! This NEEDS a DVD transfer ! Paramount is probably ashamed of it - - they let TCM show it but they gave them a full frame print and it played early in the morning .

Text2: . . . I never saw the second , but this was OK . The story is kind of confusing . Juni Cortez ( Daryl Sabara ) has to enter a video games designed by the Toymaker ( Sylvester Stallone ! ! ! ) to save his sister Carmen ( Alexa Vega ) and aided by his grandfather ( Ricardo Montalban ) . And the game , if activated , will control all the minds of the children playing them . I didn't like the movie at first . The plot was vague , the jokes silly and when Juni enters the game no rules are given . Very annoying . . . and I never liked video games anyways . But eventually the story clears up , the special effects are impressive and ( best of all ) the whole trip inside the game ( 95 % of the movie ) is in 3-D ! I've always loved wearing those glasses and having things thrown at you . The effects didn't always work ( sometimes I saw double images instead of 3-D ) but when it did work it was great ! And I didn't have one of those 3-D headaches afterwards ! The acting was just OK - - this movie was basically made to show off the special effects . And top-billed Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino have maybe 10 minutes screen time combined - - although Banderas is clearly having a FUN time ! Montalban is just great as the kids grandfather but Stallone is disappointing as the main villain . He tries but he was never good at doing comedy . So I'm giving it a 6 mostly for the special effects and the 3-D . Forget what little there is of a story .

I won't detail the story , but let me correct some poor reporting : There IS a story - a very rich story , at that ! But it was not the story indicated in the few ads that were run . This is a story - and effects-driven vehicle wherein the South Korean tale of the Imoogi is told via memories of our lead character .

Text2: I'm fond of Scandinavian movies but I have just never been a too great fan of Icelandic movie . Yes , I know Iceland is not really Scandinavia , even though it officially is on paper . Let's say it's more of a semi-Scandinavian country . Just like in every other Scandinavian movie , this movie tries to take a realistic approach , with slow moving scenes and lots of different characters and build up involved . Only difference is that there is some more quirkiness added to it all . Most of the characters and some of the events seem definitely weird ones . In that regard Icelandic movies are somewhat similar to Danish films , that often also features quirkiness . Perhaps no coincidence , since Icelandic used to be a part of Denmark for a long time , until 1944 . Now , nothing wrong with some quirkiness but if it plays a too big part in the movie it goes at the expense of the credibility and the realism of the whole movie . In my opinion this is the case with "" Nói albínói "" . It's obvious that the main character is living a very boring life , due to the place he is living at . But why bother us with it ? We see how all of his days are always basically the same and that there is absolutely nothing for him to do . It's a good portrayal but it just isn't the most engaging or interesting one to watch as a viewer . Like I said , it's a good portrayal and definitely a well made movie , with all of the right intentions but that doesn't always make a great movie as well , when the movie doesn't have the most engaging story . And then the ending . Sigh , well I don't know , I definitely can understand the film-makers motivations and intentions of it but it nevertheless comes rather sudden and isn't in context with the rest of the movie . It gives an already ' depressing ' movie an even more depressing ending . I'm probably sounding too harsh , since I definitely enjoyed watching "" Nói albínói "" but in some cases an enjoyable good watch isn't the same as a great movie . The atmosphere is definitely good . Due to the nature conditions the movie also has a very special kind of lighting that adds to the movie its special atmosphere . It's a very cold feeling and bleak looking movie , that often uses empty long shots of the empty snowy streets and white covered small houses , with little of valuables in it . There is nothing wrong with making a little depressive humble movie , with some much required comical undertones , that doesn't really have a story , in general movie terms , but is more a sort of an observation of life . But to devote an entire movie to the boring life of a gifted ( which is mentioned but never really shown throughout the movie , except him being able to solve any kind of puzzles quickly . We only really get to see him as a lazy person who doesn't bother with anything . ) . Icelandic teenager is perhaps a bit too much of one thing .

234,"Text1: I vividly remember reading and listening to the tales of the courageous "" Sinbad the Sailor "" as a child , but for some reason I never watched any of the acclaimed movies until now . Well , to be entirely honest , it's mainly the work and involvement of special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen what makes the Sinbad movies acclaimed , as his legendary name is linked to the production , the special effects and the scripting . Harryhausen undeniably delivered great craftsmanship here , but the success of "" The Golden Voyage of Sinbad "" also relies on the superb work of others , like the competent direction of Gordon Hessler ( the underrated horror director of "" The Oblong Box "" and "" Cry of the Banshee "" ) and the magnificent casting choices of John Phillip Law ( "" Diabolik "" , "" Barbarella "" ) , Caroline Munro ( "" Maniac "" , "" Captain Kronos "" ) and Tom Baker ( "" Dr . Who "" ) . Last but not least there's Brian Clemens terrific script , which is fast paced and plentiful of adventurous action . The movie opens with Sinbad obtaining a golden amulet by coincidence , when a winged gargoyle drops it on his ship . Later on , a lively nightmare and a heavy thunderstorm cause Sinbad and his crew to go off course and arrive on an island where the sailor's courage and knowledge are desperately needed . The amulet Sinbad holds is just part of a puzzle and there's still one piece missing . The island's Vizier ? wearing a golden mask since a fire destroyed his face ? searches for the third piece , but so does the malignant sorcerer Prince Koura . Sinbad and his crew embark on a dangerous and long journey to find the missing piece , along with Vizier and a ravishing girl slave with a mystical birthmark on the palm of her hand . The evil Prince Koura follows the trail and practices his black magic art against them , but every magical effort weakens him . "" The Golden Voyage of Sinbad "" is the prototypic example of a versatile mythological fantasy flick . The heroic titular protagonist consecutively battles against a ship's figure siren come to life , a Vishnu-like deity holding no less than six swords in each arm , a centaur , a griffin and his nemesis when turned invisible . Harryhausen's stop-motion effects are extraordinary and perfect to the smallest detail . The battle sequences as well as several others ( like the escape from the ruined temple , for example ) are very suspenseful and the set pieces are enchanting . Caroline Munro has the yummiest cleavage ever ( another highlight in the movie ) and Tom Baker makes a perplexing bad guy .

Text2: I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but , ever since the news came that an update of "" The Hills Have Eyes "" was in talks , I had great expectations towards it . There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation , actually . Unlike "" The Texas Chainsaw Massacre "" or "" The Fog "" , to name just two examples , Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job , as his own project "" Haute Tension "" is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000 . That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting , but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like "" The Hills Have Eyes "" require as well . The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict , except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls . Deep in the New Mexican deserts , a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there , and now they still prowl the wasteland , assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways . The Carter family is next on the menu , and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females , elderly folks or even newborn babies . . . Alexandre Aja delivers the exact right amount of disturbing tension and really a lot more gore than you could possibly dream of . Much more than the overrated Eli Roth , this young French filmmaker is the new prodigy of horror . Strictly talking in terms of cinema , "" The Hills Have Eyes "" is also a more than decent production . The dialogs are fluently written and the characters are a lot more likable than in the original . By them I primarily refer to the members of the Carter family , as Michael Berryman's charisma as creepy Pluto remains unequaled . Altering the background of the desert-people into mutants was a pretty intelligent move by Aja , though . Despite being sadistic and utterly repulsive-looking bastards , these people are basically a sort of "" victims "" themselves , which brings a lot of extra depth and unsubtle social criticism in the overall simplistic story . I'm sure this film also had its share of flaws , like the editing being a little too MTV-ish perhaps , but the thrills and fast pacing were just too overpowering to have me bother about them . Kudos also to the terrific selection of songs , the convincing cast of actors and actresses and ? last but not least ? the personal trainer of those brilliant German Shepard dogs !","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Most of the students who were in the gallery watching these dissecting would get sick and leave the room but not Lewis he was fearless . A body that was dissected just before there was to be an initiation into the collage fraternity had a gold ring on it . At the initiation the next night Lewis was told that he had to go into the Raven Hill Cemetery Mausoleum where they keep the recently interred and bring the gold ring back to be accepted into the fraternity . Going into the cemetery that night Lewis finally makes it into the mausoleum and finds the body with the gold ring that he was looking for . As Lewis was about to get the gold ring off the finger of the body he hears a shriek of what turned out to be the custodians cat Pumha and as he turned in surprise the dead mans hand fell and grabbed Lewis . All of a sudden the fear that Lewis suppressed all these years since he was a little boy of the dark and dead bodies came back to him like a bolt of lighting and he fell to the ground dead , dead of fright . So ended the story of Lewis B . Moffitt the young man who tried to show that he can take the fear of being around dead bodies by ending up dead because of one . By the way on Moffitt's headstone was carved out the epithet "" I FEARED NOT "" . Far better then you would expect from the down right awful rating the movie has from the IMDb voters . "" Ring of Terror "" plays like one of those 1950's mystery / suspense shows like "" Inner-sanctum "" and "" Strange stories "" and is much better then most "" Twilight Zone "" episodes that I've seen . "" Ring of Terror "" did have an interesting story that didn't need any special effects and the acting was surprisingly good especially George Mather who played Lewis B . Moffitt . Watching the movie and knowing how bad the reviews about it were I expected to see a first-class bomb with the only redeeming value in it being some unintentional laughs but instead I was pleasantly surprised .

Text2: It seemed like this movie was just an excuse for a director's fantasy to come true with catholic school girls . But anyways , the movie is a little strange .

236,"Text1: This is one of the weirder films I've ever seen . Even the title is odd . I viewed a print in which the opening credits show the title as ' 6 - x 11 ' - - with a case fraction , which is not how I've typed it here - - yet for some reason IMDb have spelt out the title in words . Anyway , the title refers to the print format of a photograph . The photograph is crucial to the plot , but the size of the photo is irrelevant , so my guess is that the Epstein siblings ( director Jean , scriptwriter Marie ) just chose that title as an attention-getting gimmick . The last thing this movie needed was one more attention-getting gimmick . SPOILERS COMING . The story itself is very straightforward : so simple , in fact , that it could have been staged as a ballet or a dumb-show with no dialogue whatever . A handsome and sensitive young man falls in love with a beautiful dancer . She betrays him , so he commits suicide . . . which , in this movie's atmosphere , seems to be the most logical course for him to take . The dancer blithely moves onward to her next victim . . . a slightly less handsome doctor . Neither of them knows that the doctor is the suicide's brother . But then the doctor finds a photo ( guess what size it is ) among his brother's effects . The piccie shows the dancer , so at once the doctor twigs the lot . There's a tragic ending , but none of these characters seem to deserve a happy ending . This movie is filmed in a very stark mise-en-scene , rather like a minimalist version of that great German expressionist film ' The Cabinet of Dr Caligari ' . Unfortunately , the actors in this French silent employ very stylised acting techniques , almost as if they were intentionally evoking the modern perception of silent-film acting as overripe histrionics . That decision just doesn't work at all . You can make a film with stylised sets and stylised lighting - - as was done here , and as was done brilliantly in ' Caligari ' - - because the audience will realise that these were intentional choices , even if they were choices mandated by budget restrictions . But it's extremely risky to have film actors use stylised acting techniques - - as is done in this French film , but was NOT done in ' Caligari ' - - because the audience will assume that the actors were simply not capable of more naturalistic technique . Sadly , this film is one of the countless dramatic works which take the very misogynist attitude that a sexually desirable woman is a predator , a destroyer of men who deserves to die . The people who create such stories are usually heterosexual men who are afraid of their own sexual urges , but I've encountered a few dramatic works of that type which were authored by homosexual males who had their own problems with women . Which brings me to the single most distressing ( and weirdest ) aspect of this film . . . . . . namely , its production design . The actors playing the two brothers wear poncy cosmetics ( lipstick , nail lacquer , shaped eyebrows ) that make them look a right pair of drag queens , and they also wear skin-tight garments . There may be some women who are turned on by men who look like this , but the audience for such theatrics seems to be mostly gay males . I know nothing at all about the private life ( or sexual orientation ) of Jean Epstein or his sister Marie ; based on viewing this one film , they both seem to be deeply frightened of female sexuality , deeply hostile towards women , and deeply interested in eroticising the male face and physique in a manner that doesn't appeal to me as a typical ( ? ) heterosexual male , and which is unlikely to appeal to most other men or women , straight or gay . I suspect that the Epsteins have chosen here to cater for their own personal tastes : unfortunately , they've done so to the exclusion of any other audience for this film . Some movies that are deeply weird also manage to be brilliant . . . such as ' Caligari ' , ' Just Imagine ' , the Martian sequences in ' Aelita ' and the very wonderful ' The 5000 Fingers of Dr T ' : the latter is one of my all-time favourite movies . This ' 6 . 5x11 ' , however you typographise it , is just self-indulgent rubbish . On a scale of 10 , I'll give it 3 points purely for technical proficiency . Sadly , I can't even call it the weirdEST film I've ever seen . I know that I don't want to see it again .

Text2: The Finnish film ' White Reindeer ' is marketed in the USA and Britain as a horror movie , but that's not precisely accurate . This is a stark , moody film but not a scary one . It purports to be an authentic Lapp folktale about a woman named Pirita who turns into a white reindeer in order to feed upon men . This story has elements of both the vampire and the werewolf legend , as well as the succubus . Apart from reindeer being native to Lapland , I can't imagine why the reindeer was chosen as the species for this folktale's version of the shape-changer legend . Bats and wolves are predators , and therefore scary . The reindeer is a domesticated herbivore that serves humans . . . not very spooky , is it ? In one sequence , the were-reindeer woman sprouts fangs . Actual reindeer don't have fangs , so why should these be part of her transformation ? Female reindeer have antlers , so why doesn't Pirita sprout antlers ? Speaking of superstitions and myths : early in this film , a black cat scurries across the path of an approaching sledge , but the director gives this so little emphasis that it appears to have no significance . In Cornwall , it's considered good luck to have a black cat cross one's path , and this same thing is considered bad luck in America . Do Lapps have any superstitions concerning black cats ? Mirjami Kuosmanen , the actress who plays the central role in this film , is quite pretty . . . but her performance as a native of northern Lapland is weakened by the fact that she is clearly wearing makeup . Due to the low production budget , we never actually see Pirita changing into the reindeer . . . but the director cleverly gets round this by having his leading lady lunge towards the camera , then cutting to a shot of a reindeer in the same position . Still , I was hoping we would see a shot of a woman's shadow changing shape . . . or a series of human footprints in the snow abruptly becoming hoof-marks . The Lapp landscape in this movie is starkly beautiful and awesome but never frightening . The photography is excellent . There are two impressive dissolve shots involving flames , and a splendid montage sequence . I was extremely impressed by a night sequence over a bonfire . During the Midnight Sun sequences , there are two shots featuring a weird colonnade of white pillars : these appear to be artefacts of the Lapp culture , but we never learn what they are . A sequence in which a carved vertrebra dances magically across a shaman's drum has an eerie pagan power that made me think of Nijinsky's staging of ' The Rites of Spring ' . My one complaint about this film - - a minor grievance - - is that we never learn the time period in which the main action occurs . These Laplanders possess milled coins , a rifle , and loomed curtains . One sequence takes place at a prayer service that is clearly Christian , featuring a minister in geneva bands . Are we watching scenes in the twentieth century , or some earlier time ? I'll rate this moody , compelling ( but not frightening ) film . Oh , my deer !","{""output"": ""YES""}"
237,"Text1: Maupassant scholars and pedants will find ample grist for their respective mills in this entry given that Astruc has opted to take the source material merely as a guide and instead of starting at A and proceeding inexorably to Z he has reserved the right to take a bowl of alphabet soup , select a letter at random , explore it , exhaust it and then select another and so on . It's not unlike taking War and Peace as your starting point and ending up with The Red Badge Of Courage ; they have war in common but not a great deal else . Arguably the photography gets the lion's share of the plaudits . Muted colour and time after time a grouping that suggests Renoir or other Impressionists . Somewhat bizarrely the music at times - notably the opening which is a sort of reverse Sound Of Music with a young girl running through a meadow but AWAY from the camera rather than towards it - seems to fight the lyricism sounding almost martial rather than melodic . Maria Schell was tailor made for the role of the young , idealistic girl who believes naively that if a man says he loves her he must mean it and lives to be disabused of her belief and abused in most other ways . There's a nice twist on the cuckolded husband who traditionally takes a weapon to his wife's lover ; here , disturbing a tryst in a portable bathing hut the wronged spouse simply wheels it to the cliff-top and sends it to where it will do the most good . All this is roughly half of what Maupassant wrote and Astruc has chosen to end it there and omit the story of the heroine's son . As it stands it is a fine piece of story telling .

The story accelerates as it goes on , with Scrat getting into one disastrous situation after another quickly hitting the machine to get away . It's amazing how many places he travels in such a short cartoon but all of them are not only funny but beautifully drawn . As with Ice Age , the animation is absolutely spectacular .

This is just to let you know that I'm reviewing it without comparing it to the TV series . But still - - with the silly premise who ever thought this would work as a full length film ? The Clampetts strike oil , become billionaires and move to Beverly Hills . An evil bank assistant ( Rob Schneider ) and his girlfriend ( Lea Thompson ) plan to swindle them out of it all . There's very little plot , even for 90 minutes . There are some good jokes but most range from lame to insultingly stupid . It's all up to the actors to carry this off . Luckily , they're up to it . Deidrich Bader is very good as dumb as dirt Jethro ( and his sister ) - - he's full of life , engaging and has a great smile . Dabney Coleman is good but given nothing to work with as Mr . Drysdale . Erika Eleniack is cute and perky as Elly May - - she can't act but she was hired for her body not comedic talent . Cloris Leachman is good but a little too loud as Granny . Lilly Tomlin is hysterical as Miss Hathaway - - she looks great and provides the few true laughs in the film . The late Jim Varney is surprisingly very good as Jed - - who would have thought ? Schneider and Thompson try to be funny but their material is very poor . Guest appearances by Buddy Ebsen , Dolly Parton and Zsa Zsa Gabor ( in a VERY dated joke ) don't help .

Text2: An affectionate homage to the old TV series . Three old episodes were updated and a new one was written . It's also narrated by Burgess Meredith who starred in quite a few of the original TV series episodes . It starts off with a quick little prologue with Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd . It's quick , funny and provides a nice little jolt . The first segment was newly written for the movie . It involves a bitter and racist man ( Vic Morrow ) getting a taste of his own medicine . This episode is clouded by the three deaths it caused - - Morrow was decapitated by a helicopter blade and two Vitenamese children were crushed . John Landis ( who directed this ) was found not guilty in the deaths . As it stands this isn't very good . It's simplistic and heavy-handed - - like a bad Zone episode . The second one is directed by Steven Spielberg . It involves an old man ( Scatman Crothers ) gently bringing to life the old people at a retirement home . I'll be the first to admit that this is way too syrupy - - but I have a fondness for it . The acting is good , it has a great music score and , I admit , it leaves me a little misty-eyed . The third is directed by Joe Dante . It's a remake about a little boy who can make all of his wishes come true . It's well-directed with some truly incredible special effects and a good performance by Kathleen Quinlan . But it's seriously damaged by a silly happy ending ( the original didn't have that ) . Billy Mumy ( the star of the original ) has a bit part and Dante regular Dick Miller shows up as Walter Paisley . The fourth is the best . It's directed by George Miller and is a remake of the William Shatner episode where he spots a gremlin tearing apart the plane he's flying on . The gremlin in the original looked pretty ridiculous - - like a teddy bear . Here John Lithgow plays the passenger and the gremlin is more than a little scary-looking . This segment moves and has a few great jolts . Also Carol Serling ( Rod Serling's wife I believe ) has a bit part . All in all an enjoyable film .

Text2: This film was pretty controversial when it came out because it bucked the theme being touted by liberal politicians in 1984 . They wanted the US to engage the Russians and make nice to them , while President Reagan had the nerve to call this evil empire an "" evil empire "" . The public seemed to either hate the movie for having the affront to show a Communist invasion of the USA or conservatives thought it was all cool and somehow prophetic . I went to see it , in part , just because I wanted to irritate liberal friends by telling them I saw this movie ! After all , it was just a movie ! And , a fantasy involving a right or left-wing plot is certainly fair game ( though critics at the time BBQ'd the movie and branded it as evil ) . Now as for the movie itself , if you remove all the political baggage , it is a decent but far from great film - - and people on both extremes politically should bend a little - - the film ISN'T evil nor is it the greatest film ever made !

Crawford Tillinghast ( Jeffrey Combs ) has just completed a computer program to run a machine he's working on called a Resonator , Tillinghast's program works & he informs his boss & the machines inventor Dr . Edward Pretorious ( Ted Sorel ) . Together they switch the Resonator on & strange things begin to appear . . . One of Pretorious's neighbour's ( Bunny Summers ) is concerned about the weird lights & noises coming from the Pretorious Foundation & calls the police , when they arrive they find Tillinghast running out of the house & Pretorious dead in the attic with his head missing . Tillinghast is confined to a mental institution under the care of Dr . Roberta Bloch ( Carolyn Purdy-Gordon ) . Tillinghast speaks of the Resonator , he talks about how it stimulates the pineal gland which gives people a sort of sixth sense that allows them to see creatures from beyond that would otherwise be invisible , both them to us & us to them . Bloch thinks he's crackers & killed Pretorious but there are a lot of unanswered questions like what happened to Pretorious's head & what's that unidentified slime that covered his body ? What really happened that night ? Eager to find out Tillinghast is put under the supervision of Dr . Katherine McMicheals ( Barbara Crampton ) & a local police officer named Leroy ' Bubba ' Brown ( Ken Foree ) who all travel to the Pretorious Foundation to recreate the experiment & hopefully reveal the truth behind Pretorious's mysterious death . However the Resonator starts to affect them , it also offers some extremely nasty creatures a way into our world from beyond . . . Directed by Stuart Gordon I thought From Beyond was a terrific horror film , a great 80's splatter film & one of the best in my opinion . The script by Dennis Paoli based on the novel From Beyond by H . P . Lovecraft manages to incorporate plenty of gooey creatures & gore effects with a pretty good story that has likable characters . It moves along at a nice pace & never drags which is essential for a good horror film as everyone knows how it can become very tedious waiting for the next effects sequence to happen . From Beyond was made by many of the same people responsible for Re-Animator ( 1985 ) & even features a couple of the actors in starring roles , both films are similar in tone & structure with From Beyond perhaps being slightly the lesser film . It doesn't have Re-Animator's dark humour or it's outrageous gore scenes & isn't quite paced as well . From Beyond does have some outrageous special effects of it's own but are mostly limited to bizarre slimy creatures , there is some gore here like a half eaten guy , someone having their head twisted off & resultant decapitated bodies , someone pulls the skin off their face , a third eye popping out of someones forehead & Tillinghast eating some raw brains in a pathology lab . There are various special effects technicians credited & they all seem to do a pretty good job but some of the creatures look a little unconvincing & a bit rubbery , having said that I'd prefer the real life personality & look of latex & rubber any day over poor unconvincing soulless CGI creature effects . The acting is good throughout , Jeffrey Combs is a great actor & very likable as is Ken Foree who is criminally killed off far too early . The looks are provided by Barbara Crampton who is well sexy in her much mention black leather dominatrix outfit . From Beyond generally has good production values & looks OK throughout but , again unlike Re-Animator , it is a little bland & lacks a bit of imagination at times . Gordon doesn't manage to create or sustain an atmosphere like Re-Animator either but it still beats many lesser horror films . Overall I really liked From Beyond with it's over-the-top creatures & special effects , the story worked well as a whole & at only 80 odd minutes long it moves along at a nice pace , Gordon & his team couldn't quite recapture what made Re-Animator so brilliant but it's not far off . If you like your horror outrageous & over-the-top then From Beyond should entertain you . Definitely worth watching & essential viewing for horror fans , recommended .

High on PCP Billy attacks the two officers , in a struggle Billy is wrestled to the ground & never gets back up again since he dies . Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) calls in Los Angeles chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) to perform the autopsy & conduct the investigation as officer Bates is a good friend , Steve claims that the two cops beat them & deliberately killed Billy which they deny . Quincy's finding will be crucial to the outcome , unfortunately he can find nothing to back up the police officers stories . . . Episode 17 from season 4 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & is a very enjoyable murder mystery with a hint of social commentary as well thrown in there for good measure . At first all the evidence points to the two officers being guilty & since they are the police everyone is quick to assume they did it , including Quincy but I guess this episodes message is not taking people at face value or by stereotype . You know , keeping an open mind & searching for the truth which is what Quincy is all about . The kid turns out to be a lying killer yet all the press wanted was a scandal involving bad cops , one might say that is still very much the case even today . If that wasn't enough Dark Angel also has a stab at warning the audience about PCP although one can say you could insert practically any other addictive personality changing drug into the story like heroin or cannabis . In fact unusually Dark Angel ends during a police training session where Monahan lectures his fellow cops about the dangers of PCP & drugs in a very school teacher preachy type way just to hammer home the message to the audience a bit more . Along with the commendable social & moral issues raised in Dark Angel there's a good solid entertaining murder mystery here as well as Quincy has to search for the truth using his medical knowledge & skills . A really good well balanced episode that I liked a lot . Here in Dark Angel we get a rare ( maybe unique ) opportunity to go inside Lt . Monahan's house & see his wife Patty ! I don't think we have ever seen her before or indeed since . The acting is good here & veteran actor Neville Brand has a small role , during a scene set inside Monahan's living room they are both watching a cop show on telly & they comment on how they don't make them like they used to & refer specifically to The Untouchables ( 1959 - 1963 ) in which Brand appeared .

One thing I can give him a ton of credit for , the man can cry . My only thing is , as moving as the story is , Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act , so why is he taking this extremely depressing story ? But nevertheless it's still a good movie . I do have to admit it made me cry , but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson , I absolutely love this girl , ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton , I knew this girl was going to go far . She's beautiful , charming , funny and talented , can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go . But her and Will Smith , not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film . Two years ago Tim Thomas was in a car crash , which was caused by him using his mobile phone ; seven people died : six strangers and his fiancée . A year after the crash , and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer , Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother , Ben , an IRS employee . Six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly . After that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations . He finds George , a junior hockey coach , and donates a kidney to him , and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas . Two weeks before he dies he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help . She suggests Connie Tepos , who lives with an abusive boyfriend . Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish . One night , after being beaten , Connie contacts Tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house . She takes her two children and moves in to their new home . Having stolen his brother's credentials , and making himself known by his brother's name Ben , he checks out candidates for his two final donations . The first is Ezra Turner , a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano . Tim calls Ezra Turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger . Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy . He then contacts Emily Posa , a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type . He spends time with her , weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg printer . He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation . Seven Pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look , I would just recommend going for the rental vs . the theater . Will Smith pulls in a good performance , but not his best , just most of the film required him crying in every scene , but the last one with him is a doozy . But I loved the ending , it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted . There is still good people in this world and Ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need . Although he went a little far , but it was still a beautiful story .

Text2: Ghost Busters is one of those honest classics that will forever be remembered . It's one of those old wacky comedies that anyone could love . Not to mention it's unique idea of a story , while most ghost stories are supposed to be scary , Dan Aykroyd and Harrold Rammis made this into a genuine comedy that is so much fun to watch while it still has it's spooky moments here and there . They also picked the perfect cast and great characters , they clicked so well , and I think that's what made the story work so well .

"" Adding immensely to this film's already considerable entertainment value is the always charming and delightful presence of the divine Stella Stevens , who portrays the titular shady lady casino hostess with her customary winning blend of brassy firebrand panache and sassy sophisticated sexiness . Tired of her lackluster lot in life , Stevens plans on stealing a hefty multi-million dollar sum of cash from Circus Circus in order to make things better for herself . Helping Stella out with her daring heist are friendly security guard Stuart Whitman , rascally old high stakes gambler Jessie White , and the foxy salt'n'pepper distaff duo of Linda Scruggs and Lynne Moody . Standing in Stella's way is ruthless jerk casino manager George DiCenzo . Director Noel ( "" Youngblood "" ) Nosseck keeps the pace quick and the suspense well-maintained throughout . Moreover , the thrilling robbery itself is staged and edited with breakneck aplomb , there's a nicely funky theme song called "" Gambling Blues , "" Stephen Katz's sharp cinematography accurately nails the gaudiness of the Glitter Gulch in all its tacky day-glo splendor , and future big deal mainstream Hollywood feature composer Alan ( "" Back to the Future , "" "" Predator "" ) Silvestri supplies a splendidly snazzy'n'jazzy ersatz Lalo Schifrin score .

245,"Text1: I guess I've seen enough of Jimmy Stewart's ' normal citizen ' movies ( "" It's A Wonderful Life "" , "" The Phladelphia Story "" , "" You Can't Take It With You "" ) to make it seem unlikely that he could play a strong lead as a Western hero . But he made a number of them , and I have to say that his performance here is every bit as professional and workmanlike as some of his better known roles . The story of "" Broken Arrow "" is somewhat based in historical fact , but as with many , if not most Hollywood treatments , there's also a fair amount of poetic license taken with the characters and situations . A little bit of quick research reveals that Cochise was fifty five in 1870 when the story took place , making him somewhat older than the real Tom Jeffords , who would have been thirty eight , approximating Jimmy Stewart's age at the time of filming . What's fairly accurate is the role Jeffords played in bringing about a negotiated peace between the U . S . Government and the Chiricahua Apaches in 1872 , at least for three short years before the treaty was broken , leading to a decade long hostility that ended with Geronimo's surrender in 1886 . While it appears that Geronimo and Cohise were both part of the same Apache tribe in the movie , Geronimo was actually born to the Bedonkohe Apaches . His association with Cochise occurred when his chief Mangas Coloradas sent Geronimo to get help from Cochise to fight the Mexicans ; Mangas Coloradas ( Red Sleeves ) was the father-in-law of Cochise . I was quite surprised to see how closely Jeff Chandler resembled the real Cochise in a photograph from the era . In the film , he had that regal kind of bearing that one associates with great chiefs , as attributed by Jeffords ' Apache language teacher - "" His eyes will see into your heart , he is greater than other men "" . I was also surprised to learn after the fact , that Jeffords became a blood brother to Cochise , and wondered why it wasn't mentioned in the film . As for Geronimo , I'd have to say that this was the strongest acting role I've seen yet for Jay Silverheels , completely eclipsing the ' Me Tonto ' treatment reserved for the Lone Ranger's sidekick . His speech to Cochise defying peace with the whites was exceptionally well done and convincing . Historically , Geronimo never considered himself a chief , though he was highly regarded as a military and spiritual leader of the Apaches . Obviously , I can't finish without mentioning the exquisite appearance and performance of the White Painted Lady , Morningstar Sonseeahray , as portrayed by Debra Paget . I wonder how Stewart felt performing opposite a sixteen year old actress ? Her poise reminded me of Audrey Hepbun's own somewhat miscast appearance as an Indian woman in 1960's "" The Unforgiven "" . "" Broken Arrow "" has earned it's reputation as one of the first , if not THE first Western to treat Native Americans with humanity . It does so credibly , and is particularly revealing in Jimmy Stewart's voice over narrative following the early encounter with the wounded Apache boy . Stewart's character is a stand up guy all the way , even in the face of fierce opposition from neighbors and friends . It was with careful consideration that Cochise was able to guage the measure of Jeffords ' character with the words - "" This white man is my friend "" .

246,"Text1: Often wonderful film about children from the director who brought us such family-friendly fare as Shallow Grave , Trainspotting , and 28 Days Later ? Just a joke , not a knock . Boyle is very much deserving of praise for his broad directorial talent . Millions is very good . The story concerns two young boys who find a bag of money . The younger is obsessed with saints and religion , and wants to be charitable with it . The elder wants to use it to increase his status . The film is in the style of magical realism . It is first and foremost very entertaining , and infectious . I do have some complaints that knock the film down a couple of pegs . First off , the last time Boyle had characters coming upon a surprising amount of cash , the situation consisted of hammers against teeth , plastic bags over heads , and bullet holes through attic floors . Eventually in Millions , a criminal comes looking for his money , threatening violence upon the children . This feels like it's from another movie altogether ( namely Shallow Grave ) , and it throws a dark and unpleasant tinge over the movie . There had to be other ways to get the money in their hands without resorting to that old cliché . My second main complaint is that the film likes to veer into schmaltz every once in a while . The climactic sequence is especially vomit-inducing . I also have some smaller complaints , like John Murphy's score ? too Elfmanesque . I also think the movie could have benefited from a slightly less frenetic pacing . The relationship between the brothers could have been especially satisfying if Boyle weren't so eager to shove the story forward . Still , the movie is a lot of fun and well worth seeing .

Text2: A fantastic satire of the modern world of business . Tony Randall stars as Rockwell Hunter , a writer for television advertisements . He's not really making it at his job , and is about to go under . By a couple of coincidences , he finds out where Hollywood starlette , Rita Marlowe ( Jayne Mansfield ) , is hiding out in New York and thinks he can convince her to endorse a certain kind of lipstick . When Hunter arrives at Marlowe's apartment , she uses him to make her boyfriend , the star of a television Tarzan show , jealous . The boyfriend reveals Marlowe's secret love affair to the tabloids , and , in an instant , Rock has been reborn as "" Loverboy "" ( no , not the ' 70s rock group ) , and the girls go wild over him . He's famous , and thus begins his meteoric rise to his company's presidency . But the further up he goes , the more he realizes that this was never what he wanted , despite what he once thought . The moral of the story is a bit pedestrian , but it's one that ought to be reinforced at times . It's also delivered in quite an original way . The film is full of the kind of innovations that the undervalued Frank Tashlin was so good at . Particularly memorable is the mid-movie dig at television . Television is a constant target in the film - it was presumably making the lives of many in Hollywood a bit miserable . At the halfway point of Rock Hunter , Tony Randall pops out from behind a curtain to address those in the audience who are more the type to watch television than go to the movies . "" I wanted to interrupt the film you are watching so the T . V . people can feel at home . "" The acting in the film is universally superb . I would never have imagined that Tony Randall could carry a movie , especially playing an everyman ( I always think of him as a prissy , refined gentleman ) , but he does a great job . I saw Frank Tashlin's The Girl Can't Help It just last week . It also stars Jayne Mansfield , and I thought she was pretty bad . They tried to make her too sweet in that film . Here , she's more wicked , and thus a hundred times sexier . Mansfield is hilarious at times , especially with that little high-pitched squeal she does . It should get old , but it's very cute and always funny . When I was exiting the theater , there were a handful of women trying to duplicate the sound , unsuccessfully . The supporting cast is also wonderful , especially Henry Jones as Hunter's immediate boss . The film does have a couple of problems . The script seems to forget about characters every once in a while . Although she seems important in the beginning , Rock's niece , April , basically drops off for most of the film . Likewise his fiancée ( the one before Rita Marlowe appears , that is ) , Jenny . She comes back near the end , but her role is minimized quite a bit in the middle . Even Mansfield drops out near the end . The subplot which strictly involves her is resolved rather poorly , with a cameo appearance that should have carried more weight and really should have been funnier . All in all , though , Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter ? is a great success . .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: I think I liked Child's Play 2 more than most people , given the reviews that I've read and the movie's low voter rating on the IMDb . A cute kid's doll is once again the unlikely home of Charles Lee Ray , notorious serial killer , again feeding off of the surrealism created by seeing a kid's doll screw it's face into expressions of the purest rage and spouting all manner of profanities . By now , Ray is becoming more and more desperate to get out of the body of the doll , because as we were informed in the first film , if he spends too much time in that body he'll gradually become more and more human until one day he'll be stuck in it forever . Needless to say , Ray's a lot more interested in starting life over as a 6-year-old ( and who wouldn't ? ) rather than spending the rest of his life as a plastic doll . Although , given that he becomes more human the longer he is in that body , how human will he eventually become ? Will he ever reach full human-hood ? My guess is that he'll gradually approach being a real human being in a sort of half life , where he gets closer and closer and closer but never actually gets there , kind of like computer generated actors . There is currently much talk about how close computers can ever get to animating convincingly real people into the movies , and the leading theory seems to be something akin to my theory of Chucky turning human . He'll always get closer but he'll never get all the way there . At any rate , Andy's mother has landed in a mental institution and Andy has been taken in by a foster family with appropriate mental vacuity to be a horror movie surrogate family . When Andy becomes frightened and runs through the house , his foster father grabs him and says , ' Rule # 1 , no running in the house ! ' OK , ' dad , ' but not even when I open a closet and find myself confronted by the doll that landed my mom in the nuthouse and almost cost me my life and my very soul ? My God , man , what the hell is this guy doing with a Good Guys doll in the house in the first place ? It's difficult enough trying to figure out why it's even there WITHOUT having to watch this mental giant grab Andy by the arm and ask him what on earth is the matter . There are some funny moments in the film , such as when Chucky smashes the head of the innocent Good Guys doll , buries it , and takes its place in the house , and my favorite , when Chucky is later addressed by a doting adult , Chucky responds by saying in his cute doll voice , ' Hi ! I'm ? . Tommy ! ' The stockholders in the Play Pal corporation are distressed over the suffering that the company has endured due to the negative publicity of the events of the first movie provide the premise for the movie's rather impressive finale . In order to generate a more positive image for the company and the doll , they have decided to reintroduce it into the market . The original Chucky doll was collected by the company and examined by toy-makers , who decided that there really was nothing truly wrong with it , it was not really a demon-possessed toy , so they decided to melt it down and remake it . Why they didn't just throw it away I'm not really sure , but who cares . Waste not , want not , I guess . At any rate , Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body ( too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another ) , and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul . I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something , but you'll remember in the first movie , the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll . Jarrett Friend , writing for HorrorWatch , made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation , but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls , since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie . This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality ; my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big . Nevertheless , even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story , Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels , kind of like Psycho II , which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence . I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2 , but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting , if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape . There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film , not including , however , the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost , making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so . A bit trite , but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film , which is the final scene , one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie . Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene . I do , however , think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got . I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits .

Liz is insulted when Donaghy thinks Maloney will like it , then Maloney comes and tells how excited she is about the free publicity as Liz puts a deadpan look on her face . What is a bit uneven is the Maloney character wanting respect one minute and then glad of being on the tabloid cover next . Also , Rachel Dratch was originally supposed to play the role now taken over by Jane Krakowski . To still get some airtime , Fey has her Second City partner doing various roles in each episode but they are cameos that short-shrift Dratch's talents .

"" Ustinov is a sheer delight in every way - he's funny , he's charming , he's warm , he's relaxed - all things that , frankly , Agatha's Hercule just wasn't .

The characters have been Americanized , and though set in Acapulco , aside from a few exterior shots , you don't get much atmosphere .

250,"Text1: It's always interesting to look at movies through history as if they were all part of the same overall culture , drawing on similar behavioral conventions and technologies . Like living cultures , movies have a historical context , undergo innovations , evolve over time to reflect changing folkways , and so forth . Speed gives us an ultimate example of innovation and originality , leading through convention , to utter decadence . There have been speed movies ever since there were movies and they were new and exciting at the beginning . The Keystone Kops were pretty good . Then they became conventional , with Model As careering around urban corners , tommy guns blazing out the windows ; Bogart wheeling his speeding coupe up the slopes towards Mount Whitney in accelerated time . The big ones were saved until the movie's end usually . Then the car chase underwent what anthropologists call a revitalization movement . I'm talking about Bullitt . Nothing like this chase had ( or has ) been put on film . Then we enter a period of decadence , which we may define as increasingly perfunctory repetition and variation of a once-original idea . ( The ancient Egyptians drew very careful open hands in their hieroglyphic script . Over the millenia , with less attention being paid and with a good deal of sloppy borrowing going on , the open palm managed to turn into a simple delta shape , from which we get our letter D . That's decadence . It's a real thing . ) Well , if it's good once , let's do it again and make another nickel . Other outrageous chases followed in The French Connection , the Seven Ups , and so on ; nicely choreographed but no longer original . Now the public has seen enough car chases . Let's introduce other vehicles into the chase . We can use a runaway cruise ship . Let's put the chase at the beginning - - why make the audience wait until the end ? Beverly Hills Cop STARTS with a chase involving a car and some kind of garbage truck . Finally we reach a sort of climax with Speed . With the exception of some shenanigans on and in an elevator , the entire movie is one big chase involving diverse vehicles , most prominently a bus . Sandra Bullock is cute as the wisecracking girl drawn into the plot . Keanu Reeves is clean-cut and handsome , no more than that . But none of that matters . The only important thing is that lumbering behemoth banging cars off the freeway , leaping through 50 feet of open space , and smashing everything in sight . It's thrilling . Of course it's thrilling . We could dispense with the characters entirely and it would still be thrilling - - a thrilling hour and a half of a bus zipping along the streets of Los Angeles like a juggernaut and demolishing everything it can . I'm wondering . Surely they have a video game for children out by now , called "" Speed . "" One point for each traffic sign or highway cone . You get five points for squashing a pedestrian . Ten points for a wrecking a car . Fifteen points for a truck . Glancing blows earn you half credits . If you turn too quickly and flop over , or if you hit a locomotive , you lose .

Maybe it was another rider , but I would swear that was Gene and Champion that took a tumble during the chase after the bad guys near the finale . If I'm wrong , someone give me a heads up .

Lancaster plays John Malcolm , who is engaged to Hiller's character Cooper . When his ex-wife shows up unexpectedly , he needs to deal with the intense feelings he still has for her . Cooper has to face it as well . Major Pollock has become friendly with the almost childlike Sibyl ( Kerr ) who is terrified of life ; when his secret is revealed by Sibyl's mother , the effect on Sibyl is traumatic . These are all top-notch actors playing rich characters , but in the end , the most poignant performances belong to Niven and Kerr . Niven finally gets a chance in this film to prove his greatness as an actor , and his change from blustering braggart to timid man is awesome . His scene with Kerr as he attempts to explain himself is gut-wrenching . Kerr's Sibyl , who sees her one chance at happiness and independence from her mother fading away , gives a devastating performance . Those roles are flashier than the others ; Wendy Hiller's strong and honest portrayal may not be as showy , but it is just as good . Lancaster , who coproduced , does a great job as the tormented Malcolm , who , despite their rotten marriage , can't help loving Ann ( Hayworth ) , an aging beauty facing loneliness . Some characters in "" Separate Tables "" are resigned to their lives and have come to accept and enjoy the quiet solitude of the hotel ; one couple , Charles and Jean ( Taylor and Dalton ) are in a transition , and this will take them out of the hotel and into a new life ; Pat Cooper and Sibyl's mother , two very different women , face very different losses ; and John , Ann , Major Pollock and Sibyl attempt to reach across their separate tables , take a risk and make a connection .

RONALD COLMAN has the central role and MADELEINE CARROLL is the gorgeous aristocratic Princess Flavia that he falls in love with . Produced in lavish style by David O .

In a small role as Massey's wife , MARY ASTOR makes almost no impression at all .

As I intend to discuss this cartoon in a bit of detail , there will be spoilers : The primary character opposite the Pink Panther in a great many of these shorts is a little white guy with a mustache , said to be patterned on Friz Freleng , a noted animator / director and one of the producers of the series . He often takes on a role specific to the plot of the short . Here , for example , he is a playboy type . He pulls a nail out of the Pink Panther's foot and thus wins a friend . He rapidly becomes disenchanted with the PP's enthusiastic gratitude and tries to lose him-until he gets home and his wife and mother-in-law are waiting up-bearing a rolling-pin . Enter his new-found friend and now protector , the Pink Panther , who scares the daylights out of the wife and causes the mother-in-law to leave . The middle portion of the short is the little guy taking full advantage of his new "" weapon "" and his wife's efforts to get rid of the Pink Panther . Finally , in frustration , she nails up a note telling hubby that she's "" going home to mother "" and walks out . Our hero goes to see if she's leaving and winds up with a nail in his foot , which the wife pulls out , reversing the dynamic . She's now the beneficiary of gratitude and celebrates this by breaking bottles over her husband's head . Ah , the joys of karma !

Text2: this is a surprisingly entertaining movie . it won't win any awards for originality . this plot line has been used several times , sometimes to better effect , sometimes not . as a matter of fact , Charlie Sheen would star in pretty much the same movie , Beyond the Law , one year later ( 1992 ) . both are comparable efforts . any way , in Stone Cold Brian Bosworth , an ex football player , takes on the role of of the undercover cop .

Text2: Did you know that Karl Marx hero was Spartacus ? There's something deeply ironic about this because the film version of SPARTACUS has so many Marxist ideals it could have been subtitled "" THE STORY OF AN ENLIGHTENED PROLETERIAN HERO "" As film buffs may know the screenwriter of SPARTACUS Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted by the Hollywood studio system because of alleged communist sympathies and it's impossible not to notice that Trumbo has done a sort of leftist inversion of John Ford's "" Always make the legend "" mantra . As a history lesson SPARTACUS is rather poor , if you look up the goofs on this page you'll notice that no one has really bothered to their home work as to the history , politics and machinations of ancient Rome with perhaps the most striking piece of speculation is the myth that Spartacus was from a Greek province sold into slavery when it's far more likely he was a Roman legionnaire who was sent to gladiator school but I guess the being sold into slavery makes for a better story But this very simplistic black and white view of history can be forgiven because it's what makes SPARTACUS a great movie , we know who the bad guys are and why they're bad guys ( They're rich and cruel ) and we know who the good guys are and why they're good guys ( They're poor but noble ) and therefore the audience know instantly whose side they're on SPARTACUS is also a film famous because its director Stanley Kubrick supposedly hated it mainly down to the fact that he didn't have any involvement in the screenplay . What ? A director dislikes a movie of this standard ? I'm certain Spielberg or Scorsese would have killed to make a movie this good . It contains fine performances from all the cast but the stand outs are Douglas , Simmons , Laughton ( Someone else alleged to have had leftist sympathies ) Olivier and Ustinov , so many fine actors in one movie and you don't notice how many different accents used until it's pointed out to you . Check out those battle scenes at the end and remember this was long before CGI so these were real people making up the slave and Roman armies but for me the greatest scene of the film and one of the most haunting scenes I have ever seen is where Woody Strode and Kirk Douglas sit facing each other waiting to go into the arena . What makes it even more spellbinding is that there's no dialogue at all , we only hear the sounds of the previous contestants fighting to the death Without doubt a movie that deserves to be in the IMDb Top 250 Movies list and possibly Kubrick's best film , he certainly didn't make anything as good as this ever again . But it's a movie that was ignored for most of the major awards at that years Oscar nominations . I guess that because the Oscars are a celebration of American film making talent they didn't want to give awards to movies celebrating communist heroes","{""output"": ""NO""}"

So Emanuelle dumps Michael and gets involved in a torrid lesbian affair with enticing novelist Leona ( gorgeous stunner Micaela Lyonn ) . Sound good ? Well , it sure ain't so good due to Pasquale Fanetti's hopelessly flat and uninspired direction : Fanetti allows the sluggish pace to crawl along at an excruciatingly slow clip , a dull and drippy quality hangs heavy over the entire movie , and the whole thing crucially lacks any much-needed snazzy style or snappy momentum . While the female leads are certainly attractive ( and look quite delicious sans clothes ) , the soft-core sex scenes fail to generate any true heat because of Fanetti's bland presentation . You know a soft-core film isn't working when such seemingly can't miss ingredients as amply tasty distaff nudity , lesbianism , finger sucking , forced rough sex , erotic chopstick action , and voyeurism come across as boring and uninteresting . The insipidly droning mushy synthesizer score definitely doesn't help matters any . Only the sharp , pretty cinematography and the often nude beautiful bodies of the two female leads make this flick at least remotely watchable . But overall it's a total yawnfest .

And , chained up in a little alcove , a woman . Or is it ? She looks human , she's actually kind of cute , that is , until you get a good look at her teeth . He brings her back to his apartment where he keeps her , but she won't eat , won't drink , won't speak . What he accidentally finds out is that she does drink something , and that's blood .

Masuoka is also being followed by a man in black that knows that he has this thing in his apartment and tells him she isn't of this world . And speaking of not of this world , Masuoko is also apparently being followed by his ex-wife too , who accuses him of having their daughter hidden away from her . That part isn't exactly explained , I just sort of guessed at it . Of course now that he's found out what his little house guest likes for dinner his ex-wife isn't bothering him anymore and there's a couple of school girls gone missing .

258,"Text1: Imagine , if you will , that Tony Hancock had not died in 1968 . Furthermore , that he had re-teamed in 1975 with Ray Galton and Alan Simpson , and Kenneth Williams to make a new series of ' Hancock's Half-Hour ' for Yorkshire Television . If you can imagine all that , you should then have a rough idea of what ' Dawson's Weekly ' was like . Comedian Les Dawson had shot to stardom on ' Opportunity Knocks ! ' following years of doing stand-up in British clubs - often to unresponsive audiences - and landed his own show on I . T . V . - ' Sez Les ' . Galton and Simpson had noted the uncanny similarity between Dawson's comic persona , that of a right old misery guts , and the late Hancock , and thought it would be interesting to put him in a ' Hancock ' type show . The starting point was ' Holiday With Strings ' , a one-off special screened on / 74 . In it , Les played a would-be traveller wishing to see the world for £22 . He books a package holiday to Tossa del Mar with a cheap tour company . He gets an idea what sort of holiday this will be when the air hostess ( the great Patricia Hayes , a one-time Hancock regular ) sells raffle tickets to see who is going to have lunch on the plane . Les strikes up a friendship with Peregrine ( Roy Barraclough ) a gay coal-miner . Things get worse as passengers are made to hand over loose change to pay for an unexpected refuelling . It is not hard to imagine Hancock saying Les ' lines . In addition to Barraclough and Hayes , Dawson had good support from the likes of Mollie Sugden and Frank Thornton . It worked well , and ' Dawson's Weekly ' appeared the following year . Roy Barraclough returned , though as ' Roy ' , and he filled the Kenneth Williams role as an irritating little man who crops up every week . Instead of a Homburg hat and Astrakhan collar , Dawson wore a Hell's Angels type leather outfit - ' Darby & Joan Club , Leeds ' written on the back of the jacket , complete with long white scarf . Seven episodes were made . In ' Les Miserables ' , Les is so depressed that he goes to a psychiatrist . ' Where There's A Will ' has him trying to get married within seven days in order to qualify for an inheritance . In ' Stage Struck ' , Les's Hancockian pretensions lead him to try his hand at acting . The show ended with ' Strangers In The Night ' , set aboard a British Rail sleeper train to Scotland . Les meets an attractive woman ( Sue Lloyd ) and sneaks into her cabin for some naughty business . The next morning , however , he makes a horrifying discovery - he went to the wrong cabin and had sex with an old woman by mistake . Panicking , Les calls for an ambulance . Critics were less than impressed , however , branding it ' crude ' and ' rude ' ( funny how the definition of crudity has changed since 1975 ! ) and , at least one said the show should be renamed ' Dawson's Weakly ' . While it is not as good as the Hancock shows ( mainly down to Les looking uncomfortable in sitcom ) , it is very funny and worth a major reevaluation . Les returned to sketch shows and eventually replaced Terry Wogan as the host of the B . B . C . ' s ' Blankety Blank ' . The episodes ' Where There's A Will ' and ' The Clerical Error ' were remade twenty years later starring Paul Merton .

Text2: In the early ' 70's , a number of Sphere-published books , all credited to one ' Timothy Lea ' and whose titles were prefixed by the words ' Confessions Of A . . . ' , went on sale in Britain . I never bought one ( I was more into Agaton Sax ) , but a Form Five boy brought several to school , which he passed round behind the bike shed , the naughty bits underlined in red . They were the work of Christopher Wood , and their riotous blend of sex and slapstick made them bestsellers . In 1974 , producer Greg Smith turned the first into ' Confessions Of A Window Cleaner ' starring Robin Askwith as ' Timmy ' , a cheeky young Cockney whom the ladies adore . The director , Val Guest , had recently made another sex comedy - ' Au Pair Girls ' with Gabrielle Drake . Timmy's family is made up of half of the cast of the B . B . C . ' s ' Till Death Us Do Part ' - Dandy Nichols and Anthony Booth . Sheila White ( for me the sexiest bit of crumpet in the franchise ) played Timmy's blowsy sister ' Rosie ' , with Bill Maynard as his flat-capped Dad , who had a penchant for bringing home stuff from the Lost Property office where he worked . It amused cinema-going audiences in the ' 70's to see sitcom stars competing for attention with bare boobs and bums . At the start of ' Cleaner ' , Timmy is still a virgin , even after an encounter with a sexy stripper named ' Lil ' ( he makes love to her suspender belt by mistake ! ) but finally a customer called Jackie does the dirty deed . In the film's most notorious scene , she and Timmy make out in a kitchen awash with soap bubbles . Like ' Alfie ' , the story cheerfully bounds from one sexy encounter to another . Anita Graham pops up as an energetic Au Pair ( though her clothes disappointingly stay on throughout her scene ) , Melissa Stribling tries to seduce Timmy in a coal cellar , and Linda Hayden raises temperatures as a policewoman called ' Liz ' ( or ' Fanny The Fuzz ' as Sid disparagingly refers to her ) . The ' Confessions ' series has often been likened to the ' Carry On ' series , but I think a more realistic comparison is to be made with the ' On The Buses ' movies . Like ' Stan Butler ' , Timmy lives at home with his mother , sister , and brother-in-law . Interestingly , when Dandy Nichols backed out of the series , who did Smith replace her with ? Doris Hare , of course . Smith had the decency to acknowledge his debt to Peter Rogers at the time , while Tony Booth blasted the critics who panned ' Cleaner ' . ' The mere thought that this is the first in a series is enough to set the jaw solid ' sniffed one , while another stated simply : "" Come back ' Carry On's ' , all is forgiven ! ' . The ' Confessions ' films were noticeably tamer than the books , which were full of bad language . But the public wholeheartedly embraced ' Cleaner ' and made it the most commercially successful film on release in 1974 , paving the way not only for three sequels but numerous imitators , such as the ' Adventures ' series . I'm on their side because ' Cleaner ' not only is good fun , but boasts a great soundtrack , and a first-rate cast clearly enjoying themselves . It would not be until the ' 90's that the ' Confessions ' finally made it to terrestrial television . Channel Five ( as it was then called ) garnered excellent ratings from the quartet .

I'm not sure which was my favorite parody , I think it was either the rap battle where Simon plays George as Eminem in 8 Mile and they had that great cameo of Simon from American Idol . Of course , I enjoyed the Michael Jackson joke , I just was dying of that line "" How do you like it , huh ?

Text2: Growing up , I was a huge fan of Agatha Christie's books . I would read and reread everyone I could get my hands on . I remember being terribly excited when Death on the Nile was released in 1978 . The movie quickly became a favorite of mine that I've watched literally hundreds of times over the years without ever growing tired of it . I still find new things to enjoy with each viewing . The movie has lost none of its entertainment value on me . For me , there are two areas where Death on the Nile really excels ? Christie's story and the acting . Death on the Nile follows the basic plot structure Christie used over and over ? a group of people is isolated on a boat , train , old house , island , etc . A murder soon follows that only one of these people could have committed . Everyone is a suspect . Each character has a motive and the opportunity to have committed the murder . Death on the Nile is one of the best examples of this plot structure that Christie wrote . Unlike other mysteries , Death on the Nile does not cheat . There are no characters introduced in the last minute and there are not vital clues that the detective discovers just before revealing the murderer . It's played straight . Everything that Christie's detective Poirot knows , the viewer also knows . It's just that most of us would never put the clues together in the same manner Poirot does . As for the acting , Death on the Nile features a wonderful cast . While my personal favorites are Maggie Smith , Angela Lansbury , and Bette Davis , everyone in the cast gives a terrific performance . It may be something as simple as the look Davis gives when some Egyptian children "" moon "" her from the shore or it may be something as elaborate as Lansbury's over-the-top portrayal of the over-sexed writer , each character is played to perfection . In short , the acting is first rate . Two complaints I've read across the internet involve the perceived padding of the script and characters that aren't well rounded . The padding argument usually concerns shot after shot of Egyptian locations without much happening . Maybe it's just me , but I enjoy the scenery . Plus , I am usually having such a good time with the film that I don't want any of it to rush by . As for the characters , while it is a valid argument , I understand that it's the way Christie wrote . Most of her characters were simply there to be suspects . The rest of their lives didn't matter . I must confess that I too would have liked to see a little more dimension and depth added to some of these fascinating people . It's my only complaint .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

There was plenty going on in the world then to get the comedic juices flowing ; Reagan , Thatcher , Brezhnev , The Falklands War , three million unemployed , Arthur Scargill etc .

He got himself in hot water early on with a joke about deaf people . Responding to the criticism , Jasper said : "" What I want to know is ' who told them ' ? "" .

Text2: The mid-life years of ( now genteel ) decadent behavior by one of late Victorian England's celebrities , the Irish-born novelist-poet-playwright Oscar Wills Wilde ( 1854 ? 1900 ) . Director Brian Gilbert doesn't bandy about giving us the childhood torments of a literary genius ; instead , he and screenwriter Julian Mitchell delve right into the more prominent chapters of Wilde's life , his marriage to a woman - - producing two children - - before realizing his homosexual desires , leading to some promiscuous indiscretions before finding love with churlish , childish poet Lord Alfred Douglas . Stephen Fry gives a masterful performance as Wilde , and the portrait allows for many shadings ( this isn't a plea for the misunderstood gay artist , as Wilde himself is shown to be occasionally fickle , lusting , and selfish ) . Jude Law is equally good as ornery , demanding lover ' Bosie ' , whose tyrannical father brought about a court-case and two-year jail term for Wilde ( covered previously in 1960's "" The Man with the Green Carnation "" ) , contributing to his early demise . A provoking , insightful , eloquent film - - not at all stuffy or coy , which is due in large part to Gilbert's dexterous way with his actors and a keen sense of pacing and audience-involvement . from","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He gets a newspaper article in the mail about his daughter Jennifer's demise . Unsure of the actual cause of her death , he travels from Britain to Los Angeles to investigate . He meets a male friend of Jenny who sent the letter played beautifully by Luis Guzman . He also comes in contact with Lesley Ann Warren who was his daughter's voice coach and personal friend . He believes that Terry Valentine played by Peter Fonda is responsible for his daughter's death and he wants answers . This movie is slick in every way possible with a top notch acting cast .

Text2: During nights scented with the perfume of WILD ORCHIDS , a Javanese prince woos the beautiful wife of a visiting American tycoon . Although really little more than a story about a romantic triangle , the excellent acting & superb presentation make this a very enjoyable film . Greta Garbo , exquisite & serene , shows once again that she was more than just a perfectly sculpted face . She was also a very disciplined actress who used her tightly controlled body to convey emotional depths and subtle nuances . Even in what for her was a rather minor film , she is a marvel to watch , beyond superlatives , exhausting all adjectives . She is simply Garbo and that is enough . For sheer exoticism , few Hollywood male stars of the period could compete with Garbo . Nils Asther was one of these . Although Scandinavian , something about the bone structure of his face made him ideal for Asian roles . He had already enjoyed much success as a matinee idol by the time WILD ORCHIDS was filmed . A fine actor , he seems loath to accede all of the viewers ' attention to Garbo . ( Swedes both , they must have had some interesting private conversations on the set . ) Asther makes his characterization of the Prince a compelling blend of charm & cowardice - a creature quite capable of seducing his sultry costar into marital infidelity . The onset of talkies would prove difficult for Asther , his heavy accent making it hard for MGM to cast him effectively and he would eventually return to Sweden . However , when given the right role , as in Frank Capra's THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN ( 1933 ) , Asther was able to exhibit the natural talent he was seldom called upon to use . Lewis Stone is the solid fulcrum over which his two extravagant costars teeter . While they exude passion & sensuality , he revels in the simpler virtues - duty , dignity , and , when he finally catches on to the Prince's depredations , righteous wrath . He manages to infuse all this with a quiet sense of befuddled humor , which only makes his character all the more human . The film's first rate production values make the heat & hedonism of Java come alive for the viewer . The Javanese dancing is of particular interest . The use of sound effects in this late silent film is of some significance - they perfectly illustrate where some film purists thought the cinema should remain : with music and effects , but definitely no dialogue .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
264,"Text1: Now I was kinda interested in seeing Dreamcatcher when my friend told me that this was a pretty scary film . I watched it last night and I have to say that I was expecting these guys to get it on or something because they tried way too hard to prove their friendships on screen . I haven't read the book by Stephen King , I'm sure it's probably a thousand times better , but I'm not sure if I'll read it just because I think this is too familiar not only to other Stephen King movie adaptations , but novels as well . Dreamcatcher is just a movie that fell apart and had too much CGI along with the director who didn't seem to enjoy making this film . Pete , Jonesey , Henry , and Beaver have been friends almost forever , together they discover they have pretty special powers , that isn't well explained in the film , but there's special things they can do , they also help a young boy called Dudits , who gets brutally picked on . Their friendship continues for years to come , they go camping and end up with a very deadly attack from an alien life form that is killing everything on site . But when the guys are attacked , two are killed , Jonesey is possessed by one and Henry must help stop the attack from going on . Dreamcatcher had big potential , like a new version of The Thing for this generation , but it was too much CGI and more of a gross out horror movie that should have been more of a psychological one in my opinion . When I read that the director did this movie mainly because his mom told him too , I wasn't really surprised , because this is in no way the best Stephen King adaptation , wouldn't recommend it . The acting is bad and so is the script , I'm surprised at the kind rating it has on IMDb .

Text2: A rather obscure ( . . and , more than likely , remain obscure ) sequel to the entertaining 80's offering , The Gate , brings two of the components that made the first a success . . Louis Tripp returns as troubled and lonely nerd Terrence and the director pulling strings once again , Tibor Takács . This film takes a different direction than the first for instead of keeping it in a central location , the house possessed , this film follows Terrence and the problems that exist when he decides to go fooling around with the demonic gateway again . This time three obnoxious teenagers , Liz ( Pamela Segall ) , John ( James Villemaire ) , and Moe ( Simon Reynolds ) , butt in on Terrence as he is attempting to open the gateway in the remains of his former neighbor friend's house . Terrence , in his carefully studied research , finds that you can call forth a demon and get wishes granted with proper persuasion . So John , the clichéd bully and his stooge , Moe wish to push around Terrence and mock his even trying to do such a thing as conjuring demons . But , through the insistence of believer Liz , John and Moe humor Terrence to a degree and partake in his little ceremony . This ceremony yields the result of a demon ( one of those little demons that like to bite . . we seen many of them in the first film ) who is instantly shot by John because he is in this film to simply cause conflict and aggravation . He's a butt-head and Moe is here to be his lackey to run into trouble with . Obviously , Liz will warm to Terrence because he is the supposed hero of the picture , though to be honest he's a wee bit creepy in his Satanic garb and "" demon-speak "" . He actually admits to Liz that he only wishes to conjure the demon so that his job-less , drunk father could get his pilot job back . Each of the four teens get wishes when they threat the demon ( . . who is able to come back to life when Terrence keeps him in a jar of liquid ) . They find that their wishes , though , have serious drawbacks via "" Monkey's Paw . "" This film , as directed by Takács is not as thrilling as the original because it takes us deep within the whole demonic angle which often descends into foolishness , especially when wishes are granted then taken away . The whole mythology of the gateway as it pertains to Terrence and his cohorts can really get confusing as we hear how everything works and see it . John and Moe try to kidnap the demon to get wishes granted and find that their bodies have become the way out of hell for the "" Unholy trinity "" who need Terrence as the third gateway and Liz as the sacrifice . The ending has them in another dimension with Terrence about to slay poor Liz who begs for him to fight the force taking him over . It's a weird film , and for that alone this might be interesting for those searching for something different . I guess those who like the first film might try to check it out , but may be disappointed to find it takes a whole different approach . The scares and creepy atmosphere is not present , but the film is so unusual and weird , The gate 2 might just be your kind of diversion from the norm of today's horror film .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

266,"Text1: Directed by the current CEO of New Line Cinema , The Last Mimzy is a children's fantasy movie which goes along the grains of having its children protagonists developing special powers , communicating with one another and with an alien object that no adult ( or anyone else for that matter ) can , and to help save some futuristic civilization . Sounds like a typical walk in the park for any children's movie you might add . The Wilder siblings Noah ( Chris O'Neil ) and Emma ( Rhiannon Leigh Wryn ) find a mysterious box with strange markings , containing some weird toys , amongst which includes a harmless looking soft toy bunny christened Mimzy . Soon enough Noah starts developing intellectual prowess bordering on genius and like Peter Parker would do without eyeglasses , while Emma , with Mimzy clutched closely to chest , starts to exhibit powers that a psychic would , in addition to being able to play five stones that float and with a light show included . As parents and adults ( Noah's schoolteacher and his wife ) , they have a natural tendency for disbelief and to second guess the children , as all adults would in a made for children's movie . And the authorities are hunting for them , just as they would , as targets of a resulting city wide blackout . If anything , the chemistry between the child actors playing the siblings is believable enough , and you would agree with me that Rhiannon Leigh Wryn is adorable as the kid sister whose innocence and love play a crucial role in the movie's plot . There are a few moments with injected humour , which I thought Asian audiences would identify with immediately with Kathryn Hahn's role as a "" numbers "" obsessed lady , and for technical geeks , watch out for that logo ( I've actually had a friend who was expecting it to pop out , and to our surprise , it did ! ) Expect the rudimentary plot development , characters as well as special effects that are just functional rather than to wow . It should serve as pretty interesting for a kid , but for an adult , we would have already seen other more superior stories , beginning with Spielberg's ET .

Text2: I was still under-aged when the original Basic Instinct made its debut in the local theater's under the relatively new R rating system , but suffice to say many already know of the kinky scenes , especially the infamous crossing and uncrossing of legs sans panties which sealed Sharon Stone's status as a Hollywood femme fatale . It's been 14 years since , and the sequel is just released here . Which makes one wonder why , given the question would anyone still be interested to see an aging body doing her thing again ? It's no wonder that the preview crowd was mainly elderly uncles and aunties , who apparently had a good time dissecting whatever plot there is to this movie , and of the occupational hazards of being a mental doctor if your mental strength is found wanting . Not that it's not entertaining ( I think my week of work work and more work made me easy to please ) , but elements which were associated with the original psycho sex thriller , save for Sharon Stone's returning novelist cum serial killer Catherine Tramell , are gapingly pissing . Gone is the icepick , and the graphic violence and killing . In place is a series of murder scenes which happen almost after the deed . The sex scenes here are so reduced , they're negligible , if compared to the original . And perhaps to balance the lack of sex , this movie migrates to a more mind-numbing psycho-babble flick , since the mind is the greatest sex organ , as Stone's character Tramell , mind-tangos London psychiatrist Dr . Michael Glass ( David Morrissey ) , and detective Roy Washburn ( David Thewlis ) , investigating her for an apparent murder-suicide of famed footballer Kevin Franks , in a cameo played by Stan Collymore , yes , THAT Stan Collymore . All he had to do in his movie debut was to act stone ( pun intended ) and finger Tramell . How hard is that ? In dialogues filled with double entrées and sexual innuendos , Tramell basically waltzes through England in her see throughs , having fun running rings around the two male leads , in a carefully crafted game of cat and mouse with Glass . In her psychosis sessions with Glass on her "" risk addiction "" , there was mention of Nick Curran ( played by Michael Douglas in the first movie ) , but that was just about the link to the original . Basically as the movie wore on , bodies associated with Glass turned out murdered , and naturally Tramell , Glass and even the detective Washburn all become plausible suspects . Being the master manipulator , the audience might even be seduced by her ideas on the plausibility of certain events , and this swung the narrative into varying directions if you'd allow it . If you do , you'll probably give the possibilities the nod , despite some plot holes and an ending tense sense bordering close to absurdity . What's the motivation for the sequel ? One wonders if it's just to revitalize Stone's flagging career by putting her back in one of her more iconic villain roles in cinematic history . Then again , she should have gone back to basics and not stain the original with a relatively lacklustre sequel .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

268,"Text1: OK , so the IMDb plot synopsis describes Seagal's character Jack Cole as a "" soft spoken , mystical , new age New York cop with a checkered past . "" So basically that's Seagal playing himself again , except for the New York cop part ? He's been transferred from New York to LA to help the LAPD with the case of a serial killer who has been dubbed "" the family man , "" due to the fact that he has a tendency to kill whole families . Generally the killer has a very specific method , and the killings that have taken place since Cole came to LA have seemed a little different to him . And since he's Steven Seagal , of course it needs to be personal . Because like it or not , ole ' Steve's just good at revenge , man . The latest murder is Cole's ex-wife and her new husband , so he is brought almost miraculously into a personal involvement in the case ( that he came from New York to help find a serial killer and then that killer managed to kill his ex-wife is what I call a Movie Miracle ) , but luckily his partnership with LA Detective Jim Campbell is interesting an amusing enough to carry us past such small snags . Ad by the way , Campbell is played by Keenan Ivory Wayans who , you may have noticed , is one of the Wayans brothers , but don't let that deter you . He does manage to give a less impressive performance that Seagal in the movie but is leaps and bounds better than his idiot brothers tend to be . At the very least , when he's involved with train wreck movies like White Chicks and Little Man , at least he has the good sense to hide his face . If you ever see Marlon's name anywhere , however , run for the hills ! Of course , in The Glimmer Man , Detective Campbell's only role is to make the LAPD seem at first to be the hardcore precinct , and then immediately afterwards he transforms into nothing but comic relief . And not that he's bad at it . It was moderately amusing when he stumbled across "" powdered deer penis "" in a Chinese herb store while Taft was at the counter stumbling through some broken Chinese with the store clerks , but I've lived here in China for two years now and I've never seen anyone eat nor have heard anything about anyone eating deer penis , powdered or otherwise . On the other hand , sheep penis is a different story . I've had that myself . It was one of my Chinese friends who explained to me that "" the Chinese eat everything that runs along the ground except cars , and everything that flies in the sky except airplanes . "" In fact , by far my favorite late night food ( meaning around 4am after a long night of bar-hopping ) is barbecued sheep testicles and eyeballs at a location that my friends and I have lovingly dubbed "" the dirty street . "" I know it sounds frightening but trust me , those eyeballs are DELICIOUS . Can I just make one suggestion though ? If you ever find yourself with the opportunity to eat sparrow , make sure to eat the head first . It's a small bird , so they serve it with everything but the feathers , and you eat everything , too . Claws , bones , beak , everything . But if you save the head for last , like I did , then by the time you bite into the skull you get cold brains squirting into your mouth , and trust me , that's even a little worse than it sounds ? So anyway , while tracking the serial killer , it seems that Cole's old boss , played with satisfactory menace by Michael Cox ( who you may remember as the movie world's first Hannibal Lecter ) is attempting to enter into a shady deal with the Russians to get super-rich off the black market sales of chemical weapons . Needless to say , Cole comes off as a little nuts when he , the new guy , starts trying to convince people that there is a high-level conspiracy going on involving the Russians . Not a good way to make a first impression . There are some good action sequences ( if not exactly original ) and enough fight scenes to satisfy the Seagal fans ( who will admittedly make up most of the audience , except the film critics who warn everyone else away ) , although it's all made a little goofy by the fact that Lieutenant Cole , at one point , explains that violence is against his religion . Yeah , right . The buddy-cop angle is a clever addition to the Seagal formula and has spotty success here , but the majority of people of course are going to find it a disappointing action movie unless they're a die-hard Seagal fan . Personally , I happen to believe that movies from people like Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme speak to a certain adolescent childishness in us that should never really be completely forgotten . No , they're not Oscar winners , nor will they ever be . But if you can't find at least a little fun in some of them , you might think about lightening up a little bit !

Text2: I will always remember this film not for "" I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore "" but for the performances of a first rate cast including the late Peter Finch , the wonderful Faye Dunaway , William Holden , and Beatrice Straight's Oscar winning role as the cheated wife . The story of Network still reigns true today with networks . Everybody wants high ratings and it becomes a brutal , tortured world . Peter Finch's Oscar winning role will be his most famous and one of the last . He died before getting his Academy Award . Faye Dunaway is one of the most talented actresses around and I hear she can be a bit difficult but this role is really a good role but not one of my favorites of hers . I liked her better in Bonnie and Clyde , Chinatown , and later as Joan Crawford in Mommy Dearest . I believe the Oscar was overdue . Dunaway proves that you can be both beautiful , talented , and intelligent as she does in her roles . She always leaves a lasting impression . THe film's two hours smoothly goes by . Actress Beatrice Straight won an Oscar playing William Holden's wife . I was kind of surprised as the supporting because she is in there enough but she does give an excellent performance .

269,"Text1: While I've yet to see all of what many consider to be THE document of 20th century Olympics in Riefensthal's Olympia ( it is , of course , a very long movie , and we only saw bits in a class ) , this document of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics by Kon Ichikawa is quite the spectacle on its own . Ichikawa understands something that five years later Michael Wadleigh , director of Woodstock , would understand about filming an event ( though Woodstock will always be the better , more incredibly watchable film for me ) . And it is , simply put , to make it an EVENT - in bold letters - for people who may not even really usually watch the Olympics . The way he uses his many , many , many cameras an exhaustively large crew is staggering , and just in the first half hour or so , when the countries all line up and the audience fills in as the games kick off , it's done in a very dynamic style . He alternates interestingly between big wide shots of the crowds ( like Woodstock , seeming larger than it really is with everyone packed in thousands of masses ) , the stadium itself , and then to close-ups of individuals and bodies moving . It's this side of the film , the technical one , that is most worthwhile to see in the film . If it's less than perfect , it's because , frankly , it almost does become ' too much ' to see so many games that go on in the near three-hour running time . And the narration voice that pops up now and again sounds way too much like a narrator from old newsreels , trying to add emphasis where it's not really needed . It's too immense an event with too many goals vied for victory to add on extra words . But there are highlights though , such as the 100 meter dash , done in a slow-motion that might echo some of Ichikawa's other narrative films . And the Joe Frazier boxing match , while brief , is memorable . Sometimes Tokyo Olympiad comes off almost like an avant-garde film as much as it does just straight-on documentary , and it's here that I got drawn in . Of all major events involving sports and other games and activities and trials and such , the Olympics brings together all cultures for the sake of competing for a country's honor and respect , and Ichikawa has a very good balance between showing that and adding a distinct style to the numerous events . In fact , Ichikawa has what might be the best avant-garde sports documentary ever made , at least in the past forty or so years .

Text2: 1950 was the year of euthanasia , at least in French cinema . Two movies dealt with this harsh difficult much-debated subject : André Cayatte's "" Justice est faite "" and Richard Pottier's "" Meurtres "" . Richard who ? Richard Pottier ! An unfairly overlooked director who did not produce masterpieces but made decent interesting works . His "" Fanfare d'amour "" - which is impossible to see in France nowadays , a DVD please ! - was remade by Billy Wilder as "" some like it hot "" . His "" Caroline Cherie "" , funny amorous adventures , was the forerunner of the "" Angelique "" saga in the sixties . His detective films were not bad either ( "" la Ferme aux Loups "" "" Les Caves du Majestic "" ) . But "" Meurtres "" will probably remain his finest achievement . The subject ( euthanasia ) was more than daring at the time . Whereas Andre Cayatte ( "" Justice est faite "" ) remained mysterious about the heroine's intentions ( did she try to put an end to her mistress's suffering or did she want to latch on to a substantial amount of dough earlier ? ) , Richard Pottier and his writer ( Henri Jeanson : who else ? ) are not afraid to make us attend the whole thing : the wife's intense suffering , the helpless husband ; her plea : "" sooner or later , I'm gonna die ; please give me an injection "" ; her death as she tries to thank her husband but she cannot speak anymore . The husband ( one of Fernandel's rare tragic performances : he is prodigious ) was a schoolteacher's son . His father bled himself dry for his three sons : two of them made their way of life : a lawyer and a doctor but the third one ( Fernandel ) stayed with his dear father till his death and has modestly lived since . The sequence when Fernadel talks about his daddy is extremely moving . In direct contrast to him , we have his brothers : two mean bourgeois so called respectable men , with hateful wives ( one of them is dumb , the other disdainful ) . When the desperate brother wants to give himself up , they are not prepared to accept it : better sending him to an insane asylum ! Once again , Henri Jeanson's lines spit out their venom . "" They have two shrinks : the first one tries to find the touch of reason in a mad patient's mind ; the second tries to find the touch of madness in a sane patient's mind . "" Guess which one the brothers will choose . These brothers and their wives think that only their lives are worth preserving : the others , who cares ? who cares if a home nurse is sent to jail ? who cares if a sane man is sent to a hospital for the rest of his life ? Richard Pottier's film could be as dark as Allégret's , Duvivier's , Decoin's or Clouzot's films noirs , if it weren't for the hero's niece , wonderfully played by Jeanne Moreau . She's on the unfortunate's hero side , she refuses bourgeois conventions , and she predates woman's lib by almost twenty years . "" Meurtres "" : not to be missed .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
270,"Text1: Wow . What a wonderful experience , to see them update Godzilla yet stay true to form ! The first thing I noticed , and I noticed this right away , was that this was not the Godzilla of my childhood . Thankfully , this also was not Roland Emmerick's "" Jurassiczilla , "" either . I was stunned and ( at first ) in denial . This was so much better than the Godzilla of my childhood ! It starts out pretty much like any of the older ones . ( The DVD , however , comes with two choices . You can get English-speaking voices with English subtitles , or you can choose Japanese-speaking voices with English subtitles . Personally , I prefer to understand what I'm hearing , but it's cool the other way too . ) But it quickly becomes something more substantial and much better written , produced , directed , and executed . All that having been said , what actually impressed me so with this movie is the effects quality and their treatment of the monsters . Considering they only spent 1 , 200 , 000 , 000 Yen ( approximately $10 , 955 , 902 . 92 US ) , the effects were extremely well executed . I was enthralled with the treatment they gave King Ghidorah . What a spectacular sight ! Not at first , but . . . later on in the movie . The story was easily followed , though not so much so as to put you to sleep . The action sequences were not the kung fu styled cheese of the 60's and 70's . They were strategically orchestrated and executed with that certain Godzilla-like panache . Some Big G purists , however , will tout this as the one we've all been dreading . OH , the movie's great , but this is the TOHO installment which validates Emmerich's Jurassiczilla by including a New York sighting of past Godzilla sightings in the opening , and then later on in the movie a commanding military officer asks , "" Why Japan , again ? ! Couldn't he have picked on some other country ? "" to much laughter all around the table . The cabinet members ask repeatedly , "" Why here ? "" as if they have forgotten that Japan is home to the Kaiju , and further cannot seem to recall that Godzilla was their protector for decades . He wasn't always the bad guy . Also , Godzilla is now said to hold the souls of the thousands killed in Japan in WWII , which drags this off the Creature Feature shelf of my DVD collection , and slips it into the Supernatural / Monsters section with the 1930's Universal Mummy and other such collections ; a movie about which I am somewhat conflicted . The set models are as bad ( or as good ) as ever , the field reporters sound like ring-side boxing commentators , and the Big G looks mahvellous in his new makeover . This is obviously due to Emmerick's Western Dragon / Jurassiczilla interpretation , but don't worry Big G fans ; he's bigger , he's better , but most importantly , he's still our Big G , although Emmerich's influence is seen throughout this work in everything from a more complex story , through plot execution , monster concepts , to the superior effects . I previously thought allowing Emmerich to influence this line would be a bad move , but oddly enough , this is the only Godzilla movie in the franchise to receive the same rating as the original here at IMDb ! This venture is as implausible as the rest , but that's one of the things that makes this line so darned fun . The bad dubbing , the cheesy dialog , the obvious models all add to the campy monster fun , but this time , there were some GREAT effects ! They were much better than any previous installment , in my opinion , although the score was enough to drive you buggy ! This time the Big G relies heavily on his laser breath , to devastating affect ! and with the appearance of some of our other Kaiju favorites , this installment is one of the absolute best ! In my opinion , this is by far the best Godzilla movie made ( and I love them ALL ) ! I highly recommend it ! At a Fiendish rating of ( on the B scale ) .

272,"Text1: High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against Coach George Michaels ( Christopher George playing him as a major butt-head who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch ) . He'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer . Some twisted psychopath in sweats ( much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing ) , using a stop watch to time his executions , murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of . Soon disturbed parents call Principal Guglione ( Michael Pataki ) wondering why their children didn't come home after a prom party . Inspector Halliday ( Carmen Argenziano ) begins snooping around campus at worried parents ' request . Instantly a beleaguered Michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker . Ensign Anne ( Patch Mackenzie ) returned home from her base in Guam to receive her dead track sister's diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene . Kevin Badger ( E Danny Murphy ) is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star . Rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably . Low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak . Linnea Quigley has an amusing role as horny student Dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud ( the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed Dolores outside of the prom party ) . Vanna White has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker . Virgil Frye has a silly role as an inept officer .

Text2: Two Vietnam vets contracted a form of "" rabies "" that has caused a mental disturbance for causing violence and the unending hunger for human flesh . It seems that when they bite someone else , that "" virus "" causes the one bitten to have the same symptoms , because the soldiers ' commanding officer Captain John Saxon ( bitten by Radice ) is developing the craving after taking a small bite out of an alluring female teen neighbor . I'll just be honest . . I know this flick has it's fans , but I thought it was crap . I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons ; I seriously giggled non stop at the crude vulgar dialogue nearly every character speaks , especially the police detective . There are some ridiculously over-the-top gore scenes which nearly had me rolling in the floor like when a demented Giovanni Lombardo Radice is sawing away at a gas station attendant's torso as he hits bone or when a certain character trying to flee police in the sewer ( . . guess who ? ) gets a complete hole blown through where his stomach once was . . replete with a camera shot through the hole as police come around the corner to see their handiwork as a glide up the body shows the dazed face of the now-dead character . Both shock sequences are pretty impressive , though .

Liz Turner is John Saxon's concerned . . yet also terrified . . wife who worries about her husband's well-being and mental state . The conclusion is grim , to say the least . If you rent the DVD from netflix , I highly recommend watching the documentary with interviews by Saxon , director Antonio Margheriti , and ESPECIALLY Radice whose very candid and quite funny . Saxon says he didn't know that this film would feature flesh eating and Radice denounces his later film with Umberto Lenzi , "" Cannibal ferox . "" Director Antonio Margheriti did what he could , I guess , with the material he's stuck with . Radice says that he didn't take the material too seriously , which is probably good .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
273,"Text1: I had been hearing about this movie for a while and the word was nothing less then sterling . Expectations got even higher when rumors began to surface that Martin Scorsese was thinking of directing an English version . With almost too much baggage I sat down to watch the film that so many seem to think is the next big thing . My first reaction , as I watched the film , was that to remake the film was pointless , since I didn't think that the movie could be any better . Certainly it couldn't look any better , or sound better . Any attempts to remake much of the film would only end up as pale shadows to this version . One can almost see how Scorsese will redo scenes , say by using Sinatra when the stereo is purchased . This is as good a Hong Kong film as I've seen in quite some time . BUT , and as you can tell by the capital letters its a big but , the film slows in the second half a bit . Despite the fact that on every technical level the film never sags , and some nice plot shifts that are very good , the second half slows down just a bit too much . The problem is that on some level we know how the film is going to play out , and despite the plot twists , its just a bit too , leisurely for my tastes . To say more would be pointless , except this is a film that is worth seeing . .

Text2: From director Joshua Logan ( South Pacific , Paint Your Wagon ) , this story of the marriage and downfall of King Arthur , based on the stage musical , even at nearly three hours long , is actually pretty good . The film sees King Arthur ( Golden Globe winning Richard Harris ) briefly meeting Merlin ( Laurence Naismith ) as a young boy , before getting to the real start , where he has been taught well to rule England from his kingdom of Camelot , and he meets Guinevere ( Golden Globe nominated Vanessa Redgrave ) , who he soon marries to become his Queen . Arthur then has the idea to make the Round Table for all the best knights in the world to sit around , including Lancelot Du Lac ( Golden Globe nominated Franco Nero ) . Unfortunately for Arthur , he realises that Guinevere , or "" Jenny "" and Lancelot have betrayed him and fallen in love , and from there after , his kingdom slowly falls , with his pretending things are normal , needing advice from Merlin , the arrival of Arthur's son Mordred ( David Hemmings ) , and the battle . But don't worry , a young boy named Tom restores Arthur's hope for the future of his kingdom . Also starring Lionel Jeffries as King Pellinore , Pierre Olaf as Dap , Estelle Winwood as Lady Clarinda , Gary Marshall as Sir Lionel , Anthony Rogers as Sir Dinaden , Peter Bromilow as Sir Sagramore and Sue Casey as Lady Sybil . The critics think that actors like Harris and Redgrave can't hold a tune , I think they are pretty good , and songs such as "" C'est Moi "" , "" Then You May Take Me To The Fair "" , "" How to Handle A Woman "" , "" If Ever I Would Leave You "" , "" What Do The Simple Folk Do ? "" and of course the title songs deserve credit . It may be a bit overlong , but it is certainly worth it . It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Costume Design and Best Music for Alfred Newman and Ken Darby , and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound , and it won the Golden Globes for Best Original Score and Best Original Song for "" If Ever I Should Leave You "" , and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy .

However , from a purely aesthetic point of view , it's not one of the better made or entertaining Daffy Duck films ever made . Daffy appears behind German lines and spends most of the film annoying a Nazi officer and his flunky , Schultz . Again and again , Daffy outwits them until the end , when he is shot by a howitzer and he lands in the middle of one of Hitler's speeches . Oddly , while it was a cartoon , Hitler looked very realistic . The film ends with Daffy bashing Hitler over the head with a mallet .

This is Crichton , in one interview , occasionally intercut with clips from the movie , and still material . He talks about his early writing career , med school , worrying what the professors would think of him if they knew he was , or was trying to be , an author next to learning to be a doctor . Extra attention and focus is of course paid to and placed on the film , and the novel behind it , and the latter being turned into the former . It's all informative enough , if not necessarily terribly interesting , unless you want a brief history of how he started putting words on the page . He doesn't go into very much detail about other works , nor concepts or such . This is little more than an extended commercial for the feature , really . I would wager there are more interesting and thorough biographies , and that they might even hold actual analysis . If one only watched this and his appearance in the behind-the-scenes production on the disc , they would not get a very positive view of him . I recommend this to fans of the man , I suppose , and not sure who else .

276,"Text1: This upgrade picks up after the end of Generals , its parent game . . . the war seemed won , but the GLA just barely survived . . . and a new leader has emerged among them , one who just may be able to gather their forces and become a threat . Finish the GLA off once and for all , or aid them . This upgrade adds some new units and changes some of the old ones . . . it also adds some helpful features ( though there is still something of a lack of detail , status bars and overview ) , and three "" generals "" per side , reminiscent of the different countries feature of the multi-player side of the Red Alert games . That's 9 generals in total , each of which has unique weapons and abilities ( of course at the cost of others , but fair's fair ) , specific to what they specialize in ( such as laser , super-weapons , stealth . . . ) , and they really make things entertaining and open up for quite a number of different strategies and exciting battles . The single-player portion , in addition to the campaigns and skirmish mode , now include something called General's Challenge , which is essentially a tournament mode ( between the generals , all of which have interesting personalities / strategies ) , which makes this expansion last longer . That's a good thing , because the campaigns are only five levels each . . . they do somewhat make up for that by having several very interesting scenarios , however , such as having to complete a mission before the international opinion of the country reaches zero , taking a large island occupied by enemy forces using guerrilla tactics and using Col . Burton ( occasionally assisted by The Black Lotus ) and a small team to infiltrate an area which holds several POW camps . All three sides get an appropriate finale , if they perhaps aren't equally good . Game-play is improved upon due to the new features ( which include on / off features , some of which are for multi-player / skirmish games ) and the added units , several of which work to remove weak points about the original games ' selection and strategy options . It should be noted , however , that the air-craft carriers and cruisers can only be used in one single-player mission ( but don't get me wrong , they are exceptionally cool to use ) , in spite of what the main menu looks like , as well as the shots of them featured in the intro ( which , this time , is surprisingly flat , and feels overlong , in spite of the well-written tag-line and the quality and excitement factor of the in-game cut-scenes ( which , again , consist of game footage ) ) . Instead of briefings , this game has brief clips of television reporters from the lines detailing the latest advances , providing background for the missions . This is an original take on it , but this sadly makes the objectives less obvious . . . there was even one mission where I found myself completely unaware of what I was to do . This was less of a problem in the original ( though it still isn't a particularly big one , to be fair ) . The music is fitting , and about as good as that of Generals . The new buildings and units add pretty much everything that could be considered to be lacking in Generals , but more features would still be highly beneficial . . . stances , formations and multi-task building ( all of which were in Age of Empires II , released years before this ) are still missed . Some of the worst bugs are covered in this , but others remain ( and , as was the case with Yuri's Revenge , this also brings about one or two new ones ) . Among the most noticeable and helpful new additions , as far as units and structures go , are an Internet Center ( which protects your hackers while they get you cash ) , an ECM Tank ( which can effectively disable the electronics of enemy vehicles ) , a Listening Outpost ( a detecting unit which cloaks itself when stationary and holds two Tank Hunters , efficient for taking out unprotected enemy artillery long before they reach your base ) and a Helix ( essentially an air-borne Overlord Tank ) transport and assault chopper for the Chinese ; a Combat Cycle ( essentially a more maneuverable version of the IFV of Red Alert 2 ) , a Battle Bus ( a transport from which infantry can attack , which becomes a bunker if it is robbed of its mobility ) , the re-introduction of the efficient diversionary Fake Structures ( now upgraded so that they can be detonated at will , not to mention upgraded into the real building , making them even more of a useful strategic tool ) , and , last but not least , an ability that allows them to create a Tunnel Network at any part of the map that they can view ( making them sneakier and even more of a pest for their opponents . . . their defensive structures can now also gain Camouflage Netting , rendering them cloaked ) for the GLA ; and finally , Avengers ( tanks that , using laser ( think Paladin ) can successfully knock out every missile launched towards them or the area beyond them , provided there are enough of them ) , a Sentry Drone ( an invisible de-cloaking unit that can be upgraded to possess a small machine gun capable of taking out infantry and weaker vehicles ) , a Microwave Tank ( which , using micro waves , can disable enemy structures , including defensive ones ) and the Fire Base ( a defensive building which can have four infantry units garrisoned inside , in addition to the artillery cannon on top , evening out the three sides ' defensive structures by providing a second one to the only of the three sides that did not have one in Generals ) for the US . New Generals abilities are added , some very interesting and unique ones among them , and more upgrades are introduced , as well . The expansion has a little bit of a silly streak to it , as seen in the video sequence in which a truck , labeled "" really explosive "" ( ! ) is the cause of a large explosion when it is hit , as well as in the upgrade that gives the GLA Workers "" those shoes that they have been asking for "" , to increase their movement rate . This is definitely worth playing for anyone who enjoyed Generals , as well as any fan of Real Time Strategy ( though I would suggest you try the earlier games ) in general ( no pun intended , honest ) . I recommend this to any fan of Generals . Tons of strategic fun and excitement .

It is not a bad little slice of the entertainment cheese , but it was unfortunate that they had to lie to make it hit . On the big screen , and at home ( alone hiding under the covers in my bed reading the book late at night ) , it was an immensely scary venture into the world of the vengeful poltergeist . The main element which made this attempt more frightening than it really was , was the ( then accepted ) fact that this work centered around true events . It was sold to the world as a "" True Story . "" As it turned out , the only events which were true were the gruesome murders which were perpetrated before the Lutz's had ever heard of the house ; and that the Lutz's , the house , and Amityville all exist . The events which happened to the Lutz's described both in the book and the film , were lies . It was proved in court that the writer , "" took ( generous ) liberties , "" with the truth .

Text2: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ALL FOUR MOVIES ! ! 1 - was fresh , innovative , edgy and hard . It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful ; excellent character development , imaginative direction , professional performances by the cast and crew , a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog , and action . . . lots of good fast-paced , well-delivered action . It had a fresh comedic element without ever turning to camp or juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us . The comedy was educated , intelligent and expertly-delivered . The characters were lovable , and we got the feeling that we "" knew "" them , cared about them , wanted them to succeed . Riggs's character felt less like a character and more like a person , due to the high-level of development his character received . True , the "" gun handling "" left a lot to be desired , but the vast majority of audiences would not realize that you can not get 20 shots from a 16 shot clip . Nor would they realize that you can't just leave those empty clips on the ground ; they cost MONEY and no CoP would do that because law enforcement officers are typically not highly paid . That aside , this was an excellent movie with wonderful entertainment value . One of the best of its kind . 2 - gave us Joe Pesci's character , Leo Getz . Because of Getz , I honestly found this film to be rather endearing . Getz is one of the best characters to have been introduced to this series . Unfortunately , the edge and freshness is toned down way too much , and the action is really rather predictable . I thoroughly enjoyed bearing witness to the further development of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh , and was not in the least bored with that aspect . It is still a good movie , even though its edge is shelved for a more "" marketable "" product . 3 - is just as good as 2 . Riggs now has a new love interest and it seems as though all will be well and all manner of things will be well . It is still a few months away from the press release concerning the Glover / Gibson signing for 4 & 5 , so it seems the series has wound down , rather than up . The action is still quality , though there are fewer and fewer unpredictable moments . The comedic aspect which was enlightened and intelligent is now a bit puerile and tired . And while the performances are still professional , it seems as though Riggs and Murtaugh both are well on their way out . 4 - is the perfect ending to this series . Honestly . The characters have developed as far as I can bear to witness ; Murtaugh misfires his gun in the locker room of the precinct , Riggs gets his butt kicked by a rookie cop in the boxing ring , and Riggs and Murtaugh are both just too old for this action thing anymore . ( Gods help us with 60-something-year-old Harrison Ford in the upcoming "" Indiana Jones 4 . "" ) Their CHARACTERS speak constantly of being too old , and I'm not talking about Murtaugh's well used line , "" I'm getting too old for this sht . "" It is far beyond that . And now , with Riggs's marriage to Lorna , Murtaugh's daughter's marriage to Butters , the new babies and all the smarmy crap at the ending . . . enough is just enough . 5 - should never happen . I don't think I can bear to see anymore smarm from these two . The characters we all loved are already gone . Like in "" Invasion of the Bodysnatchers , "" they've been stolen from us . The edge from Riggs's character is gone . He's a bit hapless now , and sad rather than the lunatic mayhem we want and NEED from his character . The only way to pull off a 5th installment would be to kill off Lorna's character , the baby AND Butters . Either put Riggs back where his character was in 1 & 2 , or don't bring him out of the moth balls . PLEASE . I loved these movies , but for the love of Mike ! NO MORE !

278,"Text1: Based on a radio show this short ( an hour ) film is a bit of a meandering mess . the plot of the film has two gangs going to war and somehow in the middle of it all the daughter of an oil man is kidnapped . As the police try to solve the crime ( s ) , Cosmo Jones , a genius and amateur criminologist forces himself into the case . This is a weird film where the title character doesn't show up for a quarter of the running time . When he does show up he sort of seems as if he were added into the mix for no good reason , with a young police Sargent taking the lead . Its not until into the second half of the film that he takes center stage . Another weird twist is Mantan Moreland who is listed fourth in the credits as a "" star "" and he only shows up close to the half way mark in a role that requires him to do little more than stand around for most of his screen time ( I guess a pay check is a pay check ) . The problem is that the film wanders to and fro with out any real direction . Its starts off as a gangster story , shifts to the cops , shifts again to gang war film , turns again into a murder tale then swerves into the kidnap tale . Characters take center stage then fall to the background over and over again , not like in an ensemble film where there is ebb and flow , instead its like seeing a series of almost unconnected photographs . The result is a rather bland and un-involving movie , which is a shame since the film does have some genuinely good moments ( the near torture of Moreland is horrifying in a very real way ) and there are more than its share of funny lines . Not really worth seeking out , I'd pretty much let this one slide unless I ran across it on TV , in which case it would be worth taking a peak .

Text2: This is being sold as a Korean version of Apocalypse Now . Its not . Other than the plot device of investigating mysterious radio signals there is no similarities at all . Do not believe the hype . The plot concerns a group of soldiers sent to R-Point to investigate a group radio signals from a group of supposedly dead men . Once they cross the line into the area all sorts of strange things begin to happen and they slowly begin to dwindle in number . Yes , you've probably seen it before in other films , you know the drill a group of men cut off in a strange place where they are hunted by a seemingly supernatural force . Recent films such as the Bunker , or Deathwatch cover similar territory to varying degrees of success . For most of the running time R-Point works , as a good but not great thriller . There is a slowly building sense of dread as it goes on that thankfully never becomes overwhelming . It's not perfect as most of the men blend together and you really have no idea who is who . The real problem is that around an hour or so in the film starts to not make sense . Events become disjointed and there are some turns that seems out of left field . Granted this is a film that asks you to pay attention as little things early on show up later or give clues to whats going on , so if you look away you may feel lost . I did look away and did feel lost . I also have reservations about the reasons for events toward the end , they don't seem natural , I suspect this is due to the director attempting to add more weight to the story than a straight horror film could carry . I think the attempts at allegory weaken the film and prevent it from being either a horror film or allegory . Still I do recommend the film for those people who want to see something creepy but not too scary , and who don't mind it doesn't completely work to the end .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
279,"Text1: Watching this movie brought back some memories of the well-publicized spat between neighbours in the neighbourhood of Joo Chiat , with their antics which included the shining of spot lights at each other's house , the trading of barbs and insults , and the use of video recorders to tape down the other's antics . Naturally there are no weapons involved , but otherwise , Ithought Lakeview Terrace rang home some of the issues that these folks probably faced day to day . I'm not sure what the outcome of that spat is now though . Lakeview Terrace is one of those movies that just is , with a rather straightforward plot to begin with , presenting us with the backgrounds of the characters before putting them into each other's way with conflicting values and opportunities for quarrel spawned from misunderstandings and petty non-compromise . It's also about how the male ego refuses to back down and in wanting to have the last say , coupled with the mindset of "" I was here first so bugger off "" attitude . The race card doesn't get trumpeted out loud , but it does rear its head as potential flare points every now and then , though skimming the surface most of the time . The titular area has reference and significance to the Rodney King assault case , though now it becomes the backdrop of a cinematic neighbourly spat against the background of the infamous Californian fires . We get introduced to the Turner family , where Dad and policeman Abel ( Samuel L . Jackson ) rules the household and his kids with an iron fist and his incessant and traditional rules , frowning upon anything he deems as decadent . In comes mixed newly wed couple Chris and Lisa Mattson ( Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington respectively ) , who irks our cop next door with their very open public display of affection in the pool at their backyard , in full view of Abel's children , and so the line has been crossed . There are enough rogue cop movies out there such as Unlawful Entry with the cops threatening the peaceful lives of ordinary citizens in the neighbourhood , and this one is but one of the rather mediocre entries to the genre , with the story unravelling itself in very straightforward terms without any build up to the final act . There were opportunities that could have redeemed it , such as having a central crime piece turn awry , but alas it became something half-baked , and served only as a means of finding an exit out of the movie and end it . While certain scenes do seem that they were juxtaposed around , what managed to make this movie a cut above the rest , is once again the enigmatic presence of Samuel L . Jackson and his bad-ass attitude , amplified here because he's a cop and the law , and there's nobody one can turn to when they have to call the police authorities . A glint of the eye , a terse question asked in interrogation style , or a smile that hides its true intent , almost everything Samuel L Jackson does , tells you that you're basically screwed should you stand on the opposite end of his beliefs . And both Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington demonstrate that emotion quite perfectly ( though of course it's probably not tha difficult to do too ) through their rather meek characters who can be stepped all over given their lack of assertion of their opinions . But it's not all stern stuff from Jackson as there was a scene he shares with Wilson that provided some clues into his background and to try and elicit some sympathy from the audience with regards to his character's alleged racism and intolerance for terms other than his own , besides revealing the source of his pain . Alas by the time this came through , it didn't really matter and after realizing that the narrative had dragged a little too long , proceeded with quite a hasty finale to wrap up all the loose corners , a tad too conveniently too I may add .

Text2: Like Crash , Fast Food Nation and Babel before it , Crossing Over consists of multiple story lines bound together by a common theme examined , sometimes with just a few characters straddling across the narrative threads to link them up explicitly . Writer-director Wayne Kramer examines the issues behind the illegal immigrant problem in USA who are either trying to lay low in avoiding the law , or trying their best to gain legal residency with each experiencing different challenges that lie ahead in their quest . And it's quite ambitious for Kramer to try and pull off no less than seven parallel threads in the film , which to a certain extent I felt was largely successful , despite some being almost peripheral if not for the presence of a recognized star . Anchored by Harrison Ford as Max Brogan , an Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agent , the film weaves in and out of the different threads without feeling too forced , or the need for some compulsory and carefully designed moments to link the stories up intricately . Sometimes like the six degrees of separation , the film captures the fact that we don't have full details of that web of links , and it will feel very artificial if everyone knew everyone else , or if one event would impact severely on another . In any case , each of the story lines were engaging enough , some employing deep emotions to argue their case , while others even had to build to a crescendo of all out action , such as a supermarket shootout ( one of the nicely executed ones I've seen ) . There's an illegal Mexican woman ( a very short role by Alice Braga ) who begs Ford's Max to look after her young son in the care of unfriendly relatives , a Jewish musician ( Jim Sturgess ) who's waiting to qualify for residency and willing to do just anything to get there , his Australian girlfriend ( Alice Eve ) and Hollywood actress wannabe who had granted 2 months worth of on-demand sexual favours to an Immigration official ( Ray Liotta ) in exchange for a green card , whose wife ( Ashley Judd ) wants to adopt a child placed in a detention centre , who meets an Iranian girl ( Summer Bishil whose essay failed to condemn the terrorists of and gotten her and her family into hot soup . Then there's a Korean family who is waiting to be naturalized whose eldest son got involved with thugs ( ala Gran Torino rites of passage style ) , and another ICE agent ( Cliff Curtis ) whose family cannot stand their estranged sister whom they feel is a disgrace of their values , tradition and custom by adopting the lifestyle of Americans , yet strangely ironic as they too pursue to be American citizens . Phew , and all this with a little murder mystery thrown into the mix as well . It's about how one aspires to live in a country , yet uncompromising in one's position to adopt and adapt to the new environment . Which brings about some xenophobia , especially if one's too different from the rest , and things are made worst with the citizens unwilling to understand and lend assistance in assimilation to a new country and its idiosyncrasies . But what seemed to be a common theme here , is how power can be either used to do what's probably morally right , versus abusing it for personal gain . Given three of the lead characters here are law enforcement or in responsible positions in government agencies , it's easy to abuse privilege , and it's nothing new too , even in local context , where sexual favours get traded for leniency or the closing of an eye pertaining to illegal workers , or those here without the proper papers . And since the law is fixed ( and sometimes perverse by those who interpret it ) , and justice blind , I suppose there are times we may be compelled to lend a hand to a stranger out of nothing but on humanitarian grounds , in doing what's right and decent for a fellow human being . Crossing Over presents many of such situations and while it may be a mixed bag in its narrative , it certainly pushes the right buttons with its star-studded ensemble cast in making the audience think about , empathize with , and examine if the issues presented could have existed in the local context , with similar challenges in the treatment of those who are illegal immigrants .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
280,"Text1: ! ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! A man shoots the US president with a dart containing an infectious agent . What a stupid premise for a film . If someone wanted the president dead why didn't they shoot him with one of those old fashioned bullets made out of lead ? And just how easy would it be to shoot the president ? I know it's been done in real life but you'd think the security people would have noticed the muzzle of a gun poking out of a window 30 yards away . In fact wouldn't they have checked the buildings for snipers beforehand ? From the start I was convinced the bad guys were going to be right wing militia types but in a shock twist it turns out the villains are an IRA man and an American woman and for once it's not the Irishman who's the dumb one . Boy is this woman stupid , if she was good looking she'd be a bimbo . In fact it's impossible to take seriously the whole idea that an idiot like this would be able to engineer such a virus , especially when the script points out that not even the defence department has the resources to create such a virus . But it gets worse ( No small feat ) when it's revealed that ugly American woman has got an antidote to the virus ( Like I said it's no small feat the way this film degenerates ) so Irishman phones the president to tell him if he gets $100 million the president gets the antidote . But the president turns down the offer because "" The United States doesn't negoiate with terrorists "" Now let's think about this , the president has been told his organs will slowly dissolve due to the virus and when offered something to stop this happening he turns it down on principle ! You do get the feeling this American president isn't based on Dubya , or Clinton , or any American president , or any politician ever . It's also difficult not to notice that in real life leaders and former leaders of the IRA , Irgun , Stern gang , EOKA , PLO , UVF and ANC have all shaken hands with the American president . Oh and don't think that because the Irishman and Ms ugly bimbo want one hundred million big ones the president will suddenly decide they're blackmailers and not terrorists and give them what they thereby saving his principals . No sir this is the president of the United States after all , he'd rather dissolve than give in . Luckily the villains die and the president is saved . Sure you still want to see it ?

281,"Text1: Imagine if the unseen suicidal victim of "" The Big Chill "" secretly loathed the group gathering together after his funeral , in his memory , unleashing a deadly army of genetically engineered flies that enter the human body , taking control of the host , forcing them to attack those who haven't been invaded , as one by one become infested victims . Well , "" Infested "" is such a movie . And , as you watch , this film directly rips from "" The Big Chill "" with characters almost identical to those from the popular film from the 80's . I kind of chuckled to myself at the one responsible for causing the infestation towards the group who were supposed to be his pals , thinking that perhaps writer and director Josh Olson was poking fun at "" The Big Chill "" whose characters are a bit self-absorbed and self-important yuppies who wax existential at how they have changed since they last gathered looking at their lives differently . . Olson plays on that and then turns the swarm on them , with brutality often inflicted on the human hosts . It was like Olson was saying , "" Take that you materialistic intellectuals , with your ideals and fancy lectures on how everything's going into the crapper as you live lavishly and comfortably ! "" There's this use of bad 80's music in possibly endangering the flies that will probably cause some giggles and light kills them , so the characters at least have a fighting chance , even if it's minute . The effects are below-par , of course , and the CGI swarm of flies fail to impress . There's a great little icky scene where Zach Galligan's television actor Warren attempts to nurse a nasty flesh wound where a long gash forms down his leg with flies seen underneath the skin . But , there's one attack on a headless corpse , still invaded by flies , who is set on fire with laughable CGI that will have you rolling your eyes . Many Mighty Morphin Power Rangers fans should chuckle at former heroine Amy Jo Johnson , the final girl who must square off with the "" King of the Flies "" , who lets the f-bombs run rampant . Despite some early banter and a glimmer of exposition , it doesn't take Olson long in inflicting these characters with the infestation . Mark Margolies has an amusing cameo as a very unorthodox priest , with an especially entertaining closing scene .

Text2: A hideous rape to a lovely young teen girl heading home through the woods after exiting her all-girls-school opens this adult British mystery thriller . Soon , the one responsible for the rape will strike again , this time killing the second victim . Although this time the man gets sloppy as an Art teacher , Julie West ( the beautiful Suzy Kendall ) drives her car , with other students inside the back seat , into the forest on the main road finding him hovering over the dead student's body . Her description is hazy because of the light reflecting on his face . She still poses a threat , but not as so as the first victim , Tessa ( Lesley-Anne Down ) whose so traumatized she's borderline catatonic . Several possible suspects are served to us such as Dr . Greg Lomax ( James Laurenson ) who is trying to mentally assist Tessa back to health , Dr . Bartell ( Anthony Ainley ) , and the headmistresses husband ( Leslie Sanford ; who is often shown peering at girls ' legs , up their skirts and carries a lustful gaze ) . Det Chief Velyan ( Frank Finlay ) will reluctantly agree to allow Julie to make artistic renditions of a possible murderer , placed in the newspaper of a dogged reporter ( Freddie Jones , underneath a large hat and sunshades ) to flush the killer out of hiding . Here is when the danger towards Julie . . and Tessa . . increases as someone will obviously attempt to silence the voices that can put him away . I watched this film under a low-quality VHS print under the title , "" The Creepers "" and must say I liked it . I've noticed many label this a British giallo and that's a pretty good assessment I must say . It shows poor Tessa get her shirt and bra viciously torn off , nude photos of naked girls found by the headmistress possibly implicating her vile husband who will not hide his lust for young nubile flesh . The music was a bit loud , often melodramatically overlapping key moments of dialogue like when Julie was being interviewed by Lomax in the police car . I liked Kendall as Julie , quite a strong female heroine performance as she must contend with the fact that this killer is at large and could be just about anyone . The opening chase scenes through the woods as a killer stalked his two victims is dazzling and frightening at the same time . Tense final revelation where the killer reveals himself to be quite an important man in society while chasing poor Tessa , who has trouble even speaking or responding to anything , is a fine conclusion as Julie tries to save her as she is being raped yet again .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: I've now seen the 4 films that Tod Solondz has put out and nothing will top "" Happiness "" for controversial , uncomfortable material , but this might come in second . Aviva is a 13 year old girl ( who is played by about 7 different actresses of varying ages and races ) . She wants to have a baby because they're cute but she doesn't understand the implications . Even mom tries to explain it to her ( like , not having extra money for N-Sync tickets ) but she is determined . She gets pregnant after a visit to some family friends where she and the young man get up to mischief in the bedroom while the folks are having drinks or something , and when her folks find out they of course drag her to a clinic . After that Aviva runs away from home , and eventually hooks up with the Sunshine Family , a pro-life , teeth-baring happy bunch ( a man & woman and a bunch of foster children , many whom are handicapped ) who live in a big house and all is well until she overhears Bo ( Papa Sunshine ) plotting with someone to take out an abortionist . And that someone happens to be their neighbor Earl , who also happens to be one of Aviva's one night stands on the road . Oops .

Solondz drags you matter-of-fact through things that you'd probably rather not be dragged through , his usual style . The subject matter is definitely controversial enough already , but it's pretty odd that he'd choose to cast several actresses in the role of Aviva , one of whom is a rather large black woman with a tiny voice , and I actually think she's the best one . Anyway , if you've seen other films by Solondz you know they're of the "" love it or hate it "" variety and this is just another .

Text2: Rainer Werner Fassbinder's quietly powerful film is a sort-of remake of Douglas Sirk's "" All That Heaven Allows , "" a film and director greatly admired by Fassbinder , but it has a sharper edge than Sirk's film . In "" Ali : Fear Eats the Soul , "" the couple fighting a society's prejudice and resentment of their unconventional love must fight some of their own prejudices as well . In Sirk's film , the only thing imposing on the complete happiness of Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson was the busy-body ostracism of family and friends who didn't approve of the relationship between a rich society widow and her working-class gardener . In "" Ali , "" Fassbinder suggests that happiness isn't something that's gained from the approval of others , but rather is the responsibility of the individuals involved . One of the things I liked best about this film is that as the German society gets used to the unconventional romance and begins to accept our two protagonists , the couple themselves begin to struggle to maintain a grip on the happiness they thought would be their's by right . Fassbinder's unconventional couple are a frumpy German widow and a Moroccan immigrant 10-15 years younger than her . I gather from this film that Moroccans ( or Arabs in general ) were about as hated and feared in Germany at the time of this film's release as blacks were in America during the worst of the civil rights movement . So you can imagine how the couple's initial courting and subsequent marriage is handled by their neighbors , friends and family . Fassbinder himself was gay , and many suggest that the film is an allegory for the way homosexuals were persecuted . Fassbinder's private life undoubtedly informed his film , but the movie is really more universal than that . It really applies to anyone who's ever suffered the judgement of a group of people over something that didn't even affect those people , and really , who can honestly say that they've never been subjected to that ? Fassbinder directs in a low-key , unfussy style , yet he creates images and scenes that linger in the head long after the film is over . It's a lovely film , very well acted , scripted and directed . It's not exactly sad , because it argues that societies are able eventually to adapt to new things and accept things they originally rejected . But it's not exactly happy either , because it suggests that relationships don't necessarily become easier just because external obstacles are removed .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

286,"Text1: I saw ' Inge Larsen ' in October 2006 at the Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy . The five-reel restored print was patchworked from sources in Deutsche Kinemathek ( Berlin ) and Gosfilmofond ( Russia ) . These had some of the original intertitles but also had ' flash ' titles that were handwritten ! Worse luck , some of the flash titles were only keywords , and one was illegible . Any reconstruction of these is guesswork at best . Further , there's evidence ( from trade publications of the time ) that ' Inge Larsen ' was originally a seven-reeler butchered before its release . ( The usual procedure is to butcher a silent film AFTER its release . ) The beautiful brunette Henny Porten had been a star at Ufa until producer Hanns Lippmann lured her away with the offer of her own production company . ' Inge Larsen ' was filmed by that company for distribution by Ufa . The original release was scheduled for December 1922 . . . yet there were later retakes , and the film's eventual Berlin premiere was in October 1923 . Apparently , Henny Porten - - the film's nominal producer as well as its star - - radically shortened or removed sequences in which she didn't appear , deleting subplots and obscuring motivations of subordinate characters . My synopsis of this movie may seem simplistic ; the film seemed that way when I saw it . SPOILERS AHEAD . Wealthy aristocrat Baron Kerr holds a minor government post , and is sexually involved with sloe-eyed temptress Evelyne . A storm at sea shipwrecks the injured baron near the remote home of impoverished fisherman Larsen ( Leopold von Lebedur ) and his wife , who live with their virginal young daughter Inge ( Henny Porten , looking beautiful but not very virginal ) in their wee hut ( which looks more like a garden shed I owned once , or an Anderson shelter ) . Inge is chastely involved with Jan Olsen , a strapping local youth who is missing a few straps . While Inge nurses the injured baron , he proposes marriage . She ups sticks and straight away becomes Baroness Kerr . . . but we see that Inge's no gold-digger , because she and the baron live quietly in a small rural estate . ( Next-door over to Madame Bovary , no doubt . ) Conveniently for the plot , the Baron is suddenly appointed to a cabinet position , requiring Inge to force herself to move into a mansion in the big city and attend posh parties every night . However , Inge now gives birth to a bairn ( a baronet ? ) , proving that the baroness isn't barren . Having tasted the high life , Inge now stints everything else but her child . . . even neglecting her husband . The baron , meantime , has renewed his relationship with Evelyne . Meanwhile ( this movie has no end of meanwhiles ) , Jan has come to the big city and befriended the baron's valet Wronsky . ( Wronsky is played by an actor named Vronski ; I always find this sort of thing distracting . Did they have to name the role after the actor ? ) Anyroad , Jan and Wronsky go to a fascinatingly sleazy cabaret where Sally Bowles would have felt right at home . A fight breaks out , and Jan is injured . Wronsky takes the injured Jan back to the mansion , where Inge bandages him ; their reunion is fond but innocent . However , the baron - - still tucking in his shirt-tails from his latest tryst with Evelyne - - sees Jan departing , and hypocritically accuses his wife of infidelity . Jan gets arrested on a charge of SCENE MISSING . The distraught Inge has been a devoted mother . . . but now she decides to jump into the river and take her baby along for drowning lessons . ( The baby is wet anyway . ) This being apparently Berlin , the river Inge chooses is presumably the Spree . But her Spree is interrupted : just as the peeress jumps off the pier , Inge and her baby are fished out of the water by Wronsky . ( Shouldn't that be Jan's job ? He's the fisherman ! ) The valuable valet brings Inge home to her parents ' remote fishing hut . Jan is acquitted ; he trudges home , and he and Inge look for happiness together . ( It's over there , behind the hut . ) Und baby makes drei , although maybe not dry . Fade out . I truly couldn't follow some parts of this movie at all , which may due to my dwindling powers of comprehension but which could also be down to the original production problems with this film . . . made worse by the ( impressive , but far from perfect ) restoration . There are some beautiful exterior sequences filmed on the coast of Rügen ( a Pomeranian island in the Baltic Sea ) for the scenes among the fisher-folk , and in Copenhagen for the scenes of Inge's posh married life . Henny Porten's heroine Inge is showcased prominently in the location sequences , whilst the sequences without Porten tend to be interiors which were probably studio-based . Henny Porten was typically cast as women who were compassionate rather than merely passionate ; her sex appeal was usually tempered by casting her in roles with a maternal aspect . I must give her credit : during the Third Reich , Porten was placed under considerable pressure to divorce her Jewish husband . She stood by him , fully aware that this would ruin her career ( it did ) as well as endanger her life : amazingly , she made a modest post-war comeback even though her beauty had faded . ' Inge Larsen ' is a turgid soap opera which is well-staged and has some excellent production values , but which ( in this butchered form , at least ) offers little that isn't on better offer in ' Madame Bovary ' or ' Camille ' . I usually consider the term ' chick flick ' to be reductive and dismissive , but in this case it's a fair description . Henny Porten's beauty and talents are adequately displayed in her surviving Ufa films . In its current form , ' Inge Larsen ' is most useful as testimony that , as early as 1921 , an actress was willing to butcher a film to serve her own ego . . . and , more happily , also as testimony to the dedication and commitment of modern-day film archivists and restoration workers . To these unsung heroes and heroines , I say ' Skoal ' ! I'll rate ' Inge Larsen ' a cautious .

Text2: ' Getting a Ticket ' , a comedy short starring Eddie Cantor , is much funnier than the peculiar and protracted tailor-shop skit which Cantor had performed a few months earlier in the feature film ' Glorifying the American Girl ' .

The jokes in this 1930 movie are dated too : Cantor makes a rueful reference to ' September B . C . - - before the Crash ' . He tells a traffic cop that the suspicious bundle next to him is his laundry . When it turns out to be a bottle of Prohibition whisky , Cantor explains ' My wet wash . ' There is an impressive travelling shot as Eddie drives his car down a highway in what appears to be Nassau County , Long Island . When the cop demands to know Cantor's address , Cantor replies ' We moved . ' Cantor then sings ' My Wife Is on a Diet ' , using most of his trademarked physical business .

287,"Text1: My interest in Italian cinema is usually limited to horror films , but I made an exception for this crime flick - and I'm certainly glad that I did ! Actually , The Big Racket isn't a world away from the popular Italian Giallo styling , only instead of having a vicious murderer on the loose ; we have a small town at the mercy of a group of organised thugs . For a film with this sort of plot , it's surprising just how good The Big Racket is . Italian films from the seventies have a bad reputation for not making a lot of sense , but not only does this one make sense - it benefits from a great , multi-angled story as well . The film sees a bunch of criminals sabotaging local businesses and asking for protection money from the owners to make them stop . The police presence in the town is largely ineffective , with the exception of one man - Inspector Nico Palmieri . Of course , you can't go around intimidating people and destroying their property for long before someone is going to fight back - and as the justice system isn't working , our hero has to find other ways to bring law and order back to his town . The Big Racket benefits immensely from a strong leading performance courtesy of Fabio Testi ( star of What Have They Done to Solange ) . Testi's portrayal of the angry police officer is perfectly judged to fit the movie , and I don't think there is an actor who could be better suited to playing the lead in this movie . He heads a strong Italian cast , who all do well in bringing their characters to life , as well as providing the movie with the Italian style that it revels in . The script is really good , and finds time to flesh out its characters as well as deliver witty dialogue that is always a part of this movie's bigger budget American cousins . The plot builds well throughout as there's always enough going on to keep things interesting . It all boils down to a fabulous conclusion which serves in ensuring the movie gets the bloody end it deserves , as well as rounding off the story perfectly . The Big Racket features a great sleazy atmosphere , in which the story is able to flourish , and the catchy music score helps to make sure that the film is technically sound . Overall , The Big Racket is a must see film for both crime fans and cult fans and comes with high recommendations from me !

288,"Text1: Kai S . Peck is one courageous Director ! He has created a very substantial and quite disturbing film about an actual bizarre serial killer and through the statements and letters of his subject and a book by Paul Moor and his astute directing he has been able to step over the sensationalism of his subject and open the door into the mind of a very ill person . THE CHILD I NEVER WAS ( originally titled EIN LEBEN LANG KURZE HOSEN TRAGEN ) is frighteningly based on fact . From 1962 through 1966 a fifteen-year-old boy named Jurgen Bartsch tortured , murdered , and then sexually molested four young German boys . This infamous serial killer is first introduced in a black and white sequence of Jurgen as a 20 year old ( Tobias Schenke ) in prison for his crimes . He frankly talks about his crimes , acknowledging their evil , but at the same time seeks to uncover his own motivations for having performed such deeds . Through a series of flashbacks we see Jurgen as a child and as a 15 year old ( Sebastian Urgendowsky ) and discover he was adopted by a couple who are bipolar parents - Gertrud ( Ulrike Bliefert ) and Gerhard ( Walter Gontermann ) Bartsch . Their parenting is brutally bounced from feigned kindness to flailing mistreatments . They do not allow Jurgen to have friends , to socialize , to have any interests . When Jurgen begins to get in touch with his sexuality , they foster care him and seek professional advice for his sickness of homosexuality . Young Jurgen is unable to relate to anyone and he yearns for friends . He discovers a cave where he can escape form his ugly world and fantasize about many things , including sexual fantasies about boys ' ages 8 through 14 ' . Gradually he gives in to his compulsion to seduce boys into his cave where he tortures them , eviscerates them , and once they are dead he has sexual acting out with them . At one point he seeks a priest's ( Jürgen Christoph Kamcke ) confession booth seeking absolution , but the priest only tells him that he must confess to the police and devote his life to charity . Eventually during his fourth episode of his serial madness he leaves his victim bound , disturbed that this boy actually seems to return Jurgen's bizarre sexual advances , and when he returns to the cave the boy has escaped . Jurgen is captured and imprisoned . The way in which the film resolves is actually touching in that from surprise confessions we grow to understand these serial murders on a certain level . To reveal these facts would hamper the suspense of the film . Suffice it to say that here is a sophisticated film unafraid to enter the darkest regions of a young man's mind and in doing so heightens our awareness of the fine line between response to personal abuse and madness . The cast is extraordinarily fine . Grady Harp

Text2: Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN has been successfully transformed into a film in the skilled hands of Ethan and Joel Coen . The story is intact , the characters are given the dialog so uniquely McCarthy's invention , and the horror of the message of the book - that we have come to a point in time when crime , especially random murder , surrounds our lives - is , if anything , even more pungent than on the pages of the book . It is an amazing , and a highly disturbing movie , and while this viewer is one of the few who does not believe it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture , there is little doubt that it is a brilliant piece of cinema . The story is fairly simple : on the raw plains of Texas a slaughter of men and dogs engaged in a drug deal is discovered by a simple guy Llewelyn Moss ( Josh Brolin ) . Moss observes the mayhem , sees the drugs , finds the 2 million dollar payoff money , takes the money , and embarks on an escape , leaving his wife Carla ( Kelly Macdonald ) to escape the pursuit of a mad killer Chigurh ( Javier Bardem ) who in turn is being pursued by the local sheriff ( Tommy Lee Jones ) and a hired hit-man ( Woody Harrelson ) . The satchel of money contains a tracking device and Chigurh has the instrument necessary to follow the trail the device leads . The remainder of the film is the pursuit both in Texas and in Mexico , accompanied by countless brutal murders of all sorts by the crazed Chigurh , until a surprise ending . But the toughest part of this violent film is more in the discussion of shared philosophies between the sheriff and his old cronies : they reflect on the sad state of universal crime that is so different and more malevolent than in the ' old days ' . The conversations , in the superb dialog of these old men , bring our attention to some realities we would rather not confront , and those realities are even more disturbing than the repeated images of bloated bodies and senseless murders that fill the screen . Jones , Brolin , and Bardem are indeed superb in their roles , but the small cameos of the townsfolk of Texas are little gems of acting and direction .

A bank's president steals from the vault of his own company , hides it in a secret passage way safe within the room of his own house , rented for the summer by a popular crime novelist . Cornelia van Gorder ( Agnes Moorehead ) and her unflappable maid , Lizzie ( Lenita Lane ) occupy the residence of bank president John Fleming ( Harvey Stephens ) , during the summer season to write another novel , understanding that a series of savage murders by a killer known as The Bat have occurred inside this mansion . The Bat's disguise is a black mask over his head to make his face invisible , under a black hat , wearing a glove with claws that rip apart throats . . the killer lands a crushing blow to the throat of victims before using his claws . John Fleming is on a hunting trip with his friend , town coroner Dr . Malcolm Wells ( Vincent Price ) , and admits to stealing the money , offering a partnership . . the plan is to kill their hunting guide , use his body as a cover for John , and together withdraw the money from his safe . What John doesn't count on is Wells double crossing him , resulting in the corrupt banker's murder . . it's set up that Wells knows where the loot is and his criminal behavior might indicate that he in fact is The Bat serial killer . We even see that Wells experiments with bats in his laboratory . After her hired help leave out of fear that The Bat could return , Cornelia will have to rely on Lizzie and her chauffeur , Warner ( John Sutton ) as the only support while living in the mansion . Soon Cornelia and Lizzie are confronted by The Bat who attempts to find the hidden loot , and they seek the help of local police , led by Lt . Andy Anderson ( Gavin Gordon ) . Soon John's son , Mark ( John Bryant ) is murdered by The Bat after he uncovers his father's hidden blueprints which are a map to where the loot is located . Will The Bat be caught ? Who is the murderer ? Is it Wells , who we witness murder John in cold blood ? Is it the butler , Warner ( . . promoted from his chauffeur position ) who always seems to be away when The Bat is snooping around ? Could it be somebody else who might have a motive , knows about the loot , and could find opportunities to perpetrate the grounds of the mansion ? Entertaining , compact little "" old dark house "" chiller , aided by the star power of Agnes Moorehead and Vincent Price . I applaud the whopper of a red herring , even though I'm pretty sure others will call the bluff proposed by the filmmakers . Price is effectively sinister and sly , while the film doesn't completely isolate him as the only possible suspect . . his murder of John is a stunner , superbly executed . Moorehead is theatrical enough ( . . and seems to be enjoying herself ) as a deductive amateur sleuth , with Lane suitably silly as her often frightened pal . Elaine Edwards is Dale Bailey , the wife of an imprisoned banker who was indicted for John's wrong-doing , seeking comfort and refuge with Cornelia . . as does Judy Hollander ( Darla Hood ) , someone who is needed as an eyewitness for the trial and can provide testimony rescuing Dale's husband , Victor ( Mike Steele ) . The film's highlights include The Bat's constant attempts to infiltrate the Fleming mansion , his attacks on victims who are in the wrong place at the wrong time , and a particular scuffle in Wells ' lab where the killer's identity will be discovered . I think observant viewers can determine the killer judging by behavior alone , but there are several clues that also indicate who he could be . Nice use of the setting as our heroines attempt to survive , find the possible place where the stash is hidden , and catch the killer . Fans of Price and Moorehead shouldn't be too disappointed .

Text2:  Beethoven  isn't a great family film , but it is surprisingly sweet and amusing . It's one of those films that is strangely attracting , though you can't really understand why . I think a lot has been built up on this film just because there were some sequel spin-offs that were more than horrible . ( The 3rd and 4th sequels with Judge Reinhold were some of the worst attempts at comedy . Ever . ) But the original was a nice , family-friendly film that accomplishes what it promised . Charles Grodin plays George Newton : Family man , businessman , NOT a doggy-man . But things change rapidly when a runaway Saint Bernard named Beethoven comes to the Newton residence . Newton's children immediately get attached to the animal , but Grodin's character doesn't exactly like the fact of a big ol ' slobbering dog being around his house . So there are some gags as Grodin gets mad at Beethoven for certain things he does throughout the film . But then , evil animal vet Dean Jones tries to take Beethoven , and Newton decides to fight back for his family and bring the doggy back home . "" Beethoven "" isn't anything very original , and it isn't anything very memorable , nor is it excellent quality gags . But it's a surprisingly pleasant and good-natured family film that doesn't resort to crude humor or language like other so-called "" family films "" out there . Ivan Reitman , who has brought us "" Ghostbusters , "" "" Kindergarten Cop , "" and "" Stripes "" co-produced this film . He's a talented director , even if he sometimes makes average films . The thing about his films are , that even when they're average they are still pretty funny and strangely watchable . And though I'm not sure what all a producer does on a film , I think he probably did a good job with something on this film . : ) Charles Grodin is one of those actors that I've always liked because he seems very down-to-earth and regular . He is a subtle comedian that never goes OTT and doesn't come off like ANOTHER Jerry Lewis-Jim Carrey hybrid . "" Beethoven "" isn't anything great , but it's strangely likable and enjoyable . When compared to other so-called family films , it's pretty nice . It doesn't skimp on the gags ( even if they're not very great ) and it never turns stupid ( like the 3rd and 4th film ) .

He is a troublemaker , but when he finds and befriends a baby kestrel , Kes , he finds solace and starts to train it to get away from his dysfunctional family and torment of school .

Perhaps it is because The Guinea Pig presents Britain in a positive rather than a negative light or , to put it another way , perhaps we can feel nostalgia for an IDEA of a lost Britain rather than an actual one . Dickie Attenborough then 23 and already married for three years ( to Sheila Sim , who marries Robert Fleyming here ) ' got away ' with playing the working class schoolboy awarded a scholarship to a Public school as a ' socialist ' experiment and part of the enjoyment is watching the traditional ' values ' of that lost England reflected in the prism of the Public school as they had been in Goodbye , Mr . Chips and would be again in The Browning Version though all three films had a different focus . Today when ANY form of education is anathema to the Blairites it's difficult if a film like this would last five minutes should anyone be foolish enough to produce and screen one but as long as Channel 4 is prepared to air this type of movie we can bask in its core values for an hour or so even as the barbarians are at the gate .

Text2: Any filmmaker who offered the public something entitled They'll Come To A Bad End would hardly expect to have them queuing down the Mile End Road but say it in French , Gibier de Potence and it's a different matter entirely . It's not easy to pigeon-hole this entry from Roger Richebe dating from 1951 . At one level it's a Reverse Angle on the White Slave trade with the ' victim ' being a young man fresh out of an orphanage who is ' targeted ' by Alice ( Arletty ) an ultra discreet pimp who runs a dress shop and arranges liaisons on the side for the odd lonely ( and loaded ) lady . She breaks Marceau in gently , coaxing him initially to pose for some risqué photographs and then turning him loose on her clientele . There's a certain amount of fascination in this strictly platonic relationship - Alice is possibly asexual having flatly ruled out lesbianism yet equally indifferent to heterosexuality - and Richebe keeps us interested . Marceau who , in between gigs serves as a soldier in the Second World War , is a mixture of self-disgust and innocence and eventually and inevitably he meets a ' normal ' young girl who represents his lost innocence . They fall in love and have their mayfly moment of happiness but it is , of course , destined to end in tears .

The first "" Men in Black "" already wasn't exactly a masterpiece but at least it had some fun moments and was original . I think that the originality is the main problem with this movie . Once you have seen "" Men in Black "" this movie can only be disappointing since it adds nothing as a movie . But a just as big problem is the story . It really is one of the weakest stories of 2002 . The movie is very simply and quite frankly it doesn't always make sense especially the horrible ending which I hate with a passion . However just like the first movie this one is also fun and has some good moments but unlike "" Men in Black "" it also has some very bad and unfunny moments . Wil Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are really the two highlights of the movie . The both are wonderful together once again . Also Michael Jackson shows up in a fun cameo and Tony Shalhoub reprises his role as Jeebs but it once again is Frank the Pug that steals the show . Just as in the first movie the special effects and most of the make-up are just plain horrible . They look so fake , I don't know was it intentional ? Either way I just can't like it . Lara Flynn Boyle is terrible as the main villain , for once I can fully agree with Razzie Awards for giving her a nomination . Johnny Knoxville is a waste of talent , he actually has lot's of potential as a comedy actor but his talent is truly wasted in this movie and his character is even irritating at points . About Rosario Dawson I also can't say much positive . . . Her character was irritating me and there was no chemistry between her and Will Smith . Believe me , there are some good moments in this movie and I laughed more than once it's just that there are so many things wrong with this movie and the movie leaves an overall pointless impression .

Text2: This is a pretty interesting experiment to watch . It's the first ever , still existing attempt , to unite sight with sound . It features two men dancing to a violin player ( possibly William K . L . Dickson himself ) , who is standing next to an Edison recording cylinder , that is capturing the sound . The sound and images were not linked together as one yet . And it wasn't until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together . It's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound picture . The movie is made by William K . L . Dickson , a assistant to Thomas Edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to unite pictures and sound . The answer he provided was the Kinetophone , a Kinetoscope ( basicly a large wooden box with a peephole in it , so people could watch the moving images ) with a cylinder phonograph inside of it , for the sound . This is the first , that we know off , surviving movie-experiments that feature this technique . All of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately . So the Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound . In some cases , people could even choose from three sound cylinders , featuring 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images . Only 45 Kinetophones were ever made so you could hardly call the Kinephone a success . Also after this experiment , focus went off to other cinema techniques , mainly regarding movie-projectors . So the experiment itself obviously did not become a success , also since it took over 30 more years before the first movies with sound were made and commercially released . They just couldn't yet technically synchronize and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available , it would had been a very expensive job to do so . It therefor really isn't the most influential or historically important movies out of cinematic history but it's very interesting to watch , how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and movie-making .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
297,"Text1: Adolf Hitler . The very name is enough to send a chill down your spine . Not because of what it is or was , but because of what it stands for , what we involuntarily and immediately think of when we are reminded of him . The deaths of so many people and the cause of so much evil . Now , almost sixty years after his death , we finally get a chance to see his downfall , his last hours and days . . . and this turns out to be a very revealing portrayal . Oliver Hirschbiegel takes what so many people have tried to turn into a monster and makes it human again , makes us believe that this man actually existed and was a man , not a beast . We see Hitler's frustration at defeat , his kindness to his employees , his refusal to accept the truth . The plot is very good , and almost completely authentic . I could only find two historical inaccuracies in the film , and that is incredible , compared to the amount of stuff that was as if taken directly from the history book or another equally reliable source . The pacing is great . I was hardly bored at any point during the film , despite it being quite long and the language spoken was one I couldn't understand ( thank god for subtitles ) . With that said , I have to applaud this film's realism and authenticity . Every single German character in the film speaks German . There are a few scenes with Russian characters as well . . . and they naturally speak Russian . Not English with a poorly faked accent , like we generally see in Hollywood films . In fact , there is not really any Hollywood in the film . Just gritty , hard realism . No heroic acts that are rewarded . No ' fireball ' explosions . No holding back on injuries , even when it comes to ' our heroes ' . Actually , that's probably what impressed me the most ( when it comes to non-Hollywood stuff in this film ) ; there are no heroes . No one is raised above the rest , no one is pure , good and true all the time . . . no one is a hero . Everyone is a human being . The acting is flawless . Bruno Ganz is a perfect choice for Adolf Hitler . No , scratch that ; THE perfect choice . You forget that you're watching an actor . You're completely absorbed by his performance . The casting was mostly spot-on , with most of the historical characters looking and acting just like they did in real life . The details are another thing that raises this film to a new level . The tiniest little things in these people's lives , the most human and typical things are presented as they are or were , in the film . Hitler's Parkinson's disease , Goebbels ' slight limp , etc . Smaller details include a soldier quickly rubbing his eyes of soot and gunpowder before looking through binoculars and a brief dialog showing Hitler and his promises ' effect on many Germans , even children . This is just so talented directing , it's hard to say anything negative . The editing is sharp and the cinematography is perfect . Not one shot lasts too long or ends too early . A few things were changed ( from the historical record of what happened ) for dramatical reasons , but it didn't bother me and probably won't be a deal-breaker for anyone else ( it really shouldn't , anyway , except maybe for historians who go for nothing but authenticity and accuracy ) . The one thing I will say is that no one should go see this movie unless they are absolutely certain of what they're in for , when it comes to violence and realism . This is gratuitous and detailed , no holding back . Not for the faint of heart . Definitely not . Also , you will need somewhat extensive knowledge of Hitler and the people around him in that time , or you won't really understand what is going on . Read up on him or watch a Discovery Channel special first , then watch the film . I recommend this to just about anyone who can tolerate the language ( I don't know if there is a dubbed version of this film , but in my honest opinion , you should stay away from any other version than the original ) and the violence , and , most importantly , the idea that Hitler was a human being , not some supernatural , cold-hearted monster .

Text2: Like many people , I first became associated with the Coen brothers through Fargo . They might have been the first filmmakers whose entire body of work I searched out and watched . And I liked every one of them . And then I was the first person in line to see their next film ( their previous film now ) The Big Lebowski . And that one just added to their shining reputation . And now , some three and a half or so years later , comes their next film , O Brother , Where Art Thou ? It has all the marks of a Coen brothers ' movie , but , for some reason , it doesn't work at all . And I know why , or at least I think I do . What makes a Coen brothers ' film distinct from a film of another director ? Some would say quirkiness . This is certainly part of it . But people can copy quirkiness , and have . Take Being John Malkovich . It is possibly the quirkiest film ever made outside of the Coen universe . But no one would mistake it for a Coen brothers ' film . Why is this ? Well , in my opinion , which , of course , is informed , it is the Coen brothers ' sense of perfection and meticulousness both in the technical aspects , the performances , and the script . Technically , O Brother is a match for any of their other films . The cinematography , mise-en-scene , sound and editing are great . The script is the biggest problem . It is bad . Not that there aren't good ideas in there . In fact , any one of the episodes could have turned out to be hilarious . Possibly , its just that there are too many episodes . Therefore , each episode runs for approximately two minutes before it is over . Each episode comprises about one sequence , and each sequence is composed of about two or three scenes . Take a look at Miller's Crossing , for example , to compare . The pace is slow . O Brother is not a short movie , yet it feels that way . And because of the sloppy script , there are no performances to speak of , really . I like any one of the actors on screen , but their characters , even the character of George Clooney , are all one dimensional . It isn't necessary to flesh out every character of a comedy , but I think some of the more colorful supporting characters should have had more screentime , more development . John Goodman should have had a more substantial part , for instance ( although his Southern accent is not very good ) , and Charles Durning's part should have been better . In fact , the whole gubernatorial race part of the plot should have been more in focus . I would have based the plot more around it , rather than having it taking place in the corners . The way the Coens get rid of Durning's opponent is just bad . The only thing the film did get right is the music . The main song that the escapees sing is just marvelous . And all the other songs written by T . Bone Burnett are excellent , also . In fact , it would be a travesty if at least that main song didn't get nominated for an Oscar . It completely deserves it . I would have given the film an all-time Coen brothers low score of , being the former low ( The Hudsucker Proxy ) , but I have to give it at least one point for the music , so final score = .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
298,"Text1: This is a rotten film - - embarrassingly bad , in fact . This was a piece of pure propaganda that was pure crap . In an attempt to rehabilitate our former enemies , the Russians , into our allies ( WWII did create some strange bedfellows ) , Hollywood produced several horrid films that portrayed the Russians as "" just like us "" , while in fact , their leader was one of the greatest mass murderers in human history . The movie is shameless in how positively it portrays the Russian people - - as 100 % wonderful and noble . While I do applaud the bravery of those Russians who fought the Germans , it was NOT generally due to love of Stalinism that motivated them , but survival . So is there anything that makes watching this film worth while ? Not much , unless you are a REAL film buff . That's because you'll see a very young Gregory Peck BEFORE he was a star . It's amazing that this film didn't end his career outright , but he somehow persevered and went on to become one of our greatest actors .

I mean , just look at the title of Intolerable Cruelty , and the tag of The Matrix Revolutions . But yes , my summary refers to the most recent three . And it does , indeed , not take into account how frenetic this can be . There's a healthy dose of action , and some of it does work . . . but much is overdone . The light-saber stuff varies , but some bits , with how casual its participants are , while the intent surely was to make it look cool , it just takes away the sense of danger , and the thrill and excitement go with it . At times , the fights are done in medium shots , which doesn't help any . The battle scenes , for really the only time in any of these movies , lack any kind of sense of progression , you can never tell who's winning , and it renders them little more than visual spectacles . The effects are amazing , I do give them that . Do the cameos add , or merely detract ? The dialog ( though it does have moments ) and acting ( come on , Hayden , you're better elsewhere . . . so's essentially everyone else ) still need work . More holes in the overall canon exist from what is seen and heard in this . This does try to , and to some extent , succeeds in , bridging the gap . The efforts do range between abruptly sudden and too slow , but the middle is reached at least for portions . It's dark in tone , and this is fairly well-achieved . My conclusion after having viewed the entire PT in succession is that Lucas started where it would have been fine to end . . . Phantom Menace feels classic , and to me , it scores the highest marks as far as being entertaining goes . After that , it just went further and further , and the emotion and how memorable they were declined at the same rate . I imagine few will argue that George has too many yes-men around him , or for that matter that he clearly did not have the entire series in his mind whilst working on any one of the individual films . I would like to point out that I am neither a disgruntled fan nor someone who grew up with the OT and / or experienced a lot of hype for these . The DVD has over a dozen featurettes ( of varying length ) , trailers , TV-spots , cut out material and a commentary track . I recommend this to those who wish to take in all of the canon cinema releases .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
301,"Text1: 1971 was a vintage year for B . B . C . comedy all right , what with ' The Two Ronnies ' getting underway , and Dave Allen beginning his marvellous , long-running series . ' Large ' combined sketches with monologues , the latter delivered by the man himself , smartly dressed , seated in a chair , cigarette in one hand , a glass of whisky ( or something ) perched on a nearby table . His style was all his own . He was cool . Unique ( With more and more modern comedy performed to speed , just think if Dave were appearing on television today , his act would probably be regarded as ' too slow ' . It used to take him three minutes just to light a cigarette and get comfortable . ) He told stories on a wide variety of topics , but mainly about religion as he had had a strict Catholic upbringing in Ireland , and took delight in mocking the subject . On one occasion , he even told a creepy horror tale , and held his audience spellbound . A number of stock characters evolved in the sketches , including a would-be revolutionary constantly trying to blow up ' El Presidente ' , and a Pope-like figure always being carried around in a chair . One of my favourite items had monks arguing over porridge , a dispute culminating in a messy fight . Another had rival undertakers ' firms competing with each other to see who could get to the cemetery first . And there was a ' Robin Hood ' spoof too . He would sign off with "" Goodnight , and may your God go with you . "" . Note the ' your God ' , and not just ' God ' . Aiding and abetting him were a number of talented comic performers such as Michael Sharvell-Martin , the late Ronnie Brody , the late Peter Hawkins , and the attractive Jacqueline Clarke . Future ' That's Life ' presenter Chris Serle was a regular in the first series . The catchy theme tune was ' Blarney's Stoned ' by Alan Hawkshaw . When the D . V .

302,"Text1: In 1975 five guys were driving through the desolate forests of Arizona and one of them seems to have been killed or kidnapped by a giant pulsing orange UFO . The others take off and return in a hurry to town and don't report the incident . When they finally do , everyone else in the little community of Snowflake thinks that they killed Travis Walton ( D . B . Sweeney ) and left his body up there somewhere . Even the state's criminal investigator ( James Garner ) is skeptical . One or two thorough police searches of the area turn up nothing - - not the crater that the loggers claim was created by the UFO - - but no body either . Young Travis is missing for five days and nights , dressed only in denims , in the mountains where the temperature drops into the 20s ( F ) . When he turns up , he's naked , incoherent , bewhiskered , and looks slightly used . He tells his friends who , once again , delay reporting the return of the dead Walton . Later Walton , in a flashback , informs the authorities that he spent the missing time aboard a kind of space ship ( the decor of which closely resembles that of the crashed one in "" Alien "" ) , where he was covered by a kind of giant condom by wrinkled , pinkish crew members . The results of the polygraph tests are inconclusive , one of Walton's friends having walked out in the middle of his . ( He was hiding a criminal record . ) There has been considerable dissension among the five loggers , though the reasons are vague , and the movie ends on a note of uncertainty . The chief logger ( Robert Patrick , Agent Doggonit in "" The X Files "" ) and Walton visit the site of the incident a few years later . Walton has always blamed the others for leaving him behind and scurrying off . But now the two estranged friends make up , smile , and drive away from the site in peace . It doesn't really click for some reason . Except for James Garner , who is his reliable self , full of folk wisdom and common sense , the performances aren't very good , and they need to be , because the script wanders around from here to there , sometimes passing beyond implausible into positively dubious . Must ALL the townspeople glare at Patrick and the others - - in the café ? At the town hall meeting in the church ? And the film has surprisingly little in the way of sense of place , of local color . There is no vastness in this vast wilderness . The interiors of the working-class homes look like generic working-class "" homes "" . And the script is so weak it leaves us in doubt about what's going on with the polygraph tests . The dialog , even when delivered believably , lacks sparkle and tag lines . On the other hand , a lot of effort evidently went into Walton's experiences aboard the space ship . I don't know whether "" Alien "" ( 1979 ) was such a good influence on space ships or not . Before "" Alien "" all space ships were shiny , metallic , high-tech , impeccably clean and full of right angles . Since "" Alien "" they all look like something cobbled together out of Play-Do by a demented five-year-old kid , then poked full of holes , and squirted with organic honey . And why all this stuff about the horrifying experience anyway ? Val Lewton discovered that sometimes the scariest things of all are those that you don't see . They'd have been better off throwing that money into the script and the cast and coming up with an effective psychological drama and mystery . I can see a neat little film coming out of it . As it is , we're more or less forced into going along with Travis Walton's spectacular story , unless the detailed flashback is lying , as well as the five loggers . Were Walton and the others pulling a hoax for whatever reason ? Who knows . Walton must have made some money out of it - - he wrote a detailed book about the event and he's co-writer on this movie . That doesn't mean it didn't happen , of course . There is simply too much evidence from credible people that SOMETHING is going on , something entirely non-paradigmatic , and we don't have the slightest idea what it is . It's a stretch to think that aliens are behind it , but if they are , I have a suggestion for our extra-terrestrial visitors . Next time you decide to pluck somebody up and take him for a long ride into outer space , don't choose some redneck nobodies in boots and cowboy hats , with names like Lamar Oakum and Dwight ( "" Big Bobbie "" ) Thumm . Drop in on Washington , DC , and make off with a politician . Take your pick . Keep him as long as you like .

Text2: Very neat production that captures the essence of New York City and its upper-middle-class suburbs in the early years of the 20th century . The performances are uniformly good . On the first viewing , Jimmy Cagney disappoints . We are , after all , used to seeing him as a bouncing semi-psychotic , even in his last film , "" One , Two , Three . "" Here , in his age , he hardly movies , content to wave a finger or slowly swivel in his desk chair or nod his head . A second viewing gets you past that kind of sadness . He's still Jimmy Cagney , with that ironic / comic voice and that mustache like a pair of russet turned-up handlebars . The rest of the cast can't be faulted either . Howard Rollins , Jr . , as the degraded black victim exemplifies a certain kind of pent-up dignity and pride . Rollins ' pride , like Coriolanus ' , can be a weakness when it becomes unyielding . It can lead to escalation and become lethal . Whether or not he should have swallowed the insults and jokes is arguable in this case but I think if I'd been in his position I'd have swept the turds off the car seat and driven away leaving behind a thick cloud of curses against the Irish . His character may be misguided but Rollins isn't . He handles it extremely well , and it's a demanding part . James Olsen is stiff , formal , and courageous . Elizabeth McGovern is very amusing as Evelyn Nesbitt , a pixillated airhead who reads numbers better when they're preceded by dollar signs . But then everyone is quite good . I haven't read Doctorow's novel but I gather that it was necessarily compressed and that several sub-stories were left out . I can understand why . As it is , some of the threads seem to dribble away . Did Tatah become a famous director ? Did Nesbitt become a star ? Why did Olsen's wife , Mary Steenbergen , run off with Mandy Potamkin ? What happened to Rollins ' baby ? Well , we can't expect too much . In order to do justice to ANY of the stories , the film has to resemble a brief encyclopedia entry on a subject like , say , the French Revolution . Robespierre walks on stage , bows , and leaves . The ending is a sad one . We've grown to like and admire Colehouse Walker , Rollins ' character . And the escape of his accomplices , which we probably applaud , foreshadow the urban unrest and racial conflicts which were let loose on us in the 1960s . Of course it's a plausible argument that if the system had worked perfectly in 1910 , we might not have had the 1960s . The score by Randy Newman is first rate . He plays a good piano .

303,"Text1: For some lame reason the box art on this proclaims it to be like Oldboy & Fight Club , and I have to wonder if whoever wrote that watched either of those movies or this , because that's a breath-takingly bad comparison . I saw no similarities to either film in this , and it stands quite well on its own merit . A young boy is harassed and disfigured by his classmates ( with acid ) when in grade school , and now as an adult he's either some crazed disfigured killer OR he's a mild-mannered construction worker , you decide , I guess , because it's rather hard to tell who he is . Split personality , I reckon . He takes a job at a construction firm only to find out that he reports to one of his former tormentors who is still well versed in the art of being a prick , and injures the guy on his first day on the job . Little does he know that this guy is ALSO his new downstairs neighbor , his wife and young son have met him but not dad , so dad isn't very suspicious when mom wants to go to the movies and leave young son with nice new neighbor , which is , of course , a big mistake . Of course when the son doesn't come back things get a bit ugly and weird . And overall this is all pretty weird anyway because you're never sure who the real Neighbor No . 13 is , the normal looking guy or the disfigured psycho . It seems certain people can see which one is real but others can't . Of course the ones that could see the disfigured guy aren't around to talk about it anymore . This is quite suspenseful and yes , even downright weird , and I liked it a lot . The ending is rather strange and it's almost as though none of what you're seeing had never happened but I'm not sure that's the case . Best see it and judge for yourself though , if you're a fan of strange Asian movies of the horror / suspense type , you'll probably enjoy this . .

Text2: It's rather odd to go back after all these years of seeing Fulci's later films and see his earlier ones , which were light years apart from what he did later in his life . This particular film was done around the time of his only other earlier film that I've seen ( Don't Torture a Duckling ) and is in the "" thriller-mystery "" style of that film , which I guess makes it a "" giallo "" . A woman may or may not have killed her neighbor , a hippie-type chick who was always having wild parties and orgies at her place . Perhaps it was jealousy at not being invited ? Or is something else entirely going on here ? Is it drugs , is she being set up by someone for some reason ? To be honest , I'd have to watch it again to see if I could figure out more , because I was rather lost at times , but it sure is cool to watch . I would love to see more of Fulci's earlier films , because it proves that his later stuff ( late 70's / early 80's ) was NOT what he was all about .

It would seem that a revolutionary new agricultural machine using radiation to eliminate insect pests is responsible . The local police inspector ( Arthur Kennedy ) , an exceptionally grumpy and cynical type , refuses to believe them and , going on Georges ' hippie-ish appearance alone , is more inclined to believe that George and Edna are responsible . While Jorge Graus ' "" Let Sleeping Corpses Lie "" ( also known by numerous other titles ) doesn't pile on zombie carnage , it's what the director does with the atmosphere that matters . A stark , moody , ominous mood is established almost from the get-go , with the overcast skies of Britain ( where the story is set ) helping immensely in this regard . It's a nicely creepy story with lots of sequences shot in almost complete darkness , and such hair-raising moments as an attempted escape from a tomb . Released just a few years after George Romeros ' original zombie classic , "" Night of the Living Dead "" , this film does up the ante in terms of on-screen violence . There's a fair bit of blood spurting and gut munching to enjoy here for fans of gore . The dismemberment of the hospital receptionist is particularly juicy . The picture moves at a fairly deliberate pace , slowly setting up what proves to be a magnificent finale indeed , and a highly enjoyable "" last minute surprise "" type ending . Lovelock and the stunning Galbo are engaging leads , with Kennedy turning in a solid performance as the hostile Inspector and Fernando Hilbeck , with his distinctive mug , doing a nice turn as the most prominent zombie of the picture .

Bibi ( the strawberry-blond bombshell Cristi Harris ) makes the mistake of lifting a tube of lipstick which she'll take on her person across the underground stream which forbids the demonic spirit to flee her "" spiritual circle "" . The lipstick opened by Shirl unleashes a snake-like crawler which enters her vagina while also releasing a "" spiritual smoke "" with Angela now free to roam . Perry ( Robert Jayne ) , a Catholic student whose passionate belief that demonic spirits still exist despite his feelings falling on deaf ears ( . . and annoying newly established priest , Father Bob ( Rod McCary ) ) , will find , through a type of ceremonial ritual , that Angela is alive and well . Melissa ( Merle Kennedy ) , a shy , sweet-hearted wallflower , an object of scorn by those who share sleeping quarters with her , is Angela's sister , an orphan terrified by dreams of her sister in demonic form . Angela desires to use her as a sacrifice for Satan within the hellish confines of Hull House . Those who entered Hull House on Halloween will face certain peril as Angela sets her sights on gaining the souls of each individual and it'll be up to yard-stick-toting nun , Sister Gloria ( Jennifer Rhodes ) and Perry , carrying holy-water-powered toy shooters and bombs , with the reluctant approval of a non-believing cynical Father Bob , to stop her before the unholy sacrifice is offered to Satan . The plot , as crazy as it is , services only as a means for incredible special effects . Director Brian Trenchard-Smith ( Dead-End Drive-in ) lets it all hang out with heads decapitated , holy water working as acid ( often melting those possessed into a goo-puddle of bubbling flesh and blood ) , the infamous lip stick tube releasing a computerized viper head , Angela's emerging as a demonic snake ( . . a fantastic creation whose fate regarding a cross baked to her chest as the sun rays shine through an image kicked away by Johnny from a boarded window , seems inspired by Hammer studios ' Dracula films ) , faces melting and steaming , boobs reaching to grab a victim's hand whose grasp burns , and ugly demonic make-up with those possessed attaining sickening , sharp teeth . Bare breasts are paraded for horror fans craving such images , and the cast Trenchard-Smith has available are beautiful / handsome . The Catholic church is skewered as Sister Gloria is lampooned thanks to her yard-stick which is always with her , almost an appendage , that third arm she needs as a moral crusader to keep the kids under her watch from sinning and partaking in lascivious acts . Her "" preparation scene "" resembles Rambo getting his gear and weapons together as he awaits battle with the enemy . There are even lip-locks between women , a very nice one between a possessed Sheril and Terri . . Terri , horrified at just seeing her potential boyfriend being beheaded , at first resists , only to slowly succumb to desire .

We even have a beheaded victim using his head as a basketball , dribbling and shooting hoops ! While attaining the same cheesy , gory , zany , sleazy spirit of the original , Trenchard-Smith has a far better cast of young adults , who aren't so annoying , with far superior special effects .

Text2: The diplomatic and political machinations around the admission of Texas to the USA are incredibly complex and are touched on in this film . It would have taken a longer and better film to explain it all . I think MGM had plans for one in this , but Dore Schary was budget cutting at the time and this got B western treatment for a stellar cast . One thing they show is true and that is the influence of 77 year old former President Andrew Jackson on the Democratic Party he founded . His prestige was that big , he was the dominant political figure for 20 years or so in the country before , during and after his presidency . Lionel Barrymore reprises the role of Jackson , he had previously played in MGM's The Gorgeous Hussy . He's still wheeling and dealing and he doesn't like what he's heard that his old friend and comrade in arms Sam Houston is climbing off his position of being for the annexation of the Texas Republic to the United States . On his own he sends Clark Gable as Devereaux Burke Texas cattleman to seek out Houston and get the real story . On the way to completing his mission Gable finds Ava Gardner who is the editor of a local paper in Austin and Broderick Crawford another Texas cattleman who is violently opposed to annexation . They get a good political rivalry and a personal one over Gardner . In the film as in real life Sam Houston , played by Moroni Olsen , is running a big bluff . He's playing footsie with the British by negotiating a treaty of alliance with them in order to force the hand of northern politicians who are against slavery , but who would like even less the British moving into Texas . There's an exciting battle between the pro and anti annexation forces while the Texas Congress meets . It results however in a very unreal conclusion to the story .

308,"Text1: I must stress to you my belief in that the ' romantic comedy ' is pretty much the worst creation of mankind . Some may argue that religion or the atom bomb are more destructive but the romcom ( ugh ! ) is consistent proof that the public are idiots willing to fork over cash multiple times for the same old , same old crap . We very rarely get a sincere romance film , they kinda died out in the forties and have struggled for breath since . I liked A Walk to Remember a lot and felt obliged to check this out ( because it's from a book by the same writer ) . That obligation turned out to be quite rewarding as this sober , mature film was everything zillion dollar attempts to make us cry ( I'm subtly referencing Pearl Harbor ) were not . It's all about character and the guts and imagination to tell a good story . Noah is a simple 17-year-old lumberyard worker . He's cocky , arrogant but very good-natured and he quickly attaches himself to Allie , a girl from the city , from Old Money and a fussy family who condemn her relationship with Noah . This is all told in flashback as old Noah ( James Garner ) reads from his book of youthful memories . Yes , this part is nothing original but the conviction by the cast make it astonishingly real and believable . The performances all round ( but especially from Gosling and Rachel McAdams ) give The Notebook a strong edge over most attempts at romance . You can literally feel their urge for each other and are involved with them all the way . ' Will she or won't she ' plot lines have been done to agonising death so credit must be given Nick Cassavetes ( who you'll probably best remember as Castor Troy's bald pal from Face / Off ) for pulling it off so eloquently . I strongly recommend that you give The Notebook a try . Even if your a hardened 300-pound muscle-man who's afraid to love it's still worth it . But I must warn you , if your the kind of person who breaks down in uncontrollable crying at the end of Bicentennial Man ( err . . . ) you must know that The Notebook ends very similarly . So if your lip quivers easily , watch it alone . The DVD is in gorgeous-looking 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen that perfectly shows off the wonderful cinematography and warm color pallet of the film . The Dolby 5 . 1 soundtrack is most unsophisticated but considering the nature of the film , that is to be expected . Extras include , 2 Commentaries by director Nick Cassavetes and writer Nicholas Sparks , 12 Deleted Scenes , featurettes on Cassavetes and Sparks , ' Locating The Notebook ' Featurette , Casting Noah and Allie Featurette , Rachel McAdams Screen Test and the Trailer .

Text2: What we have here is a sort of crossover between a spy thriller and a Giallo . Both the film's titles - ' A Taste of Excitement ' and the over the top ' Who Would Want to Kill a Girl Like You ' would lend themselves excellently to a stylish Italian thriller , so it's not surprising that the film is a lot like a Giallo . The main influence for A Taste of Fear would seem to be the Hammer Horror classic ' A Taste of Fear ' , as the films have similarities both in plotting and execution . I went into this film expecting more of a horror movie , but the film couldn't be much further away from what I was expecting ; this is pretty much just a spy thriller . The film focuses on Jane Kerell ; a young woman who decides to spend her holiday in France . It's not long before she has become the victim of a series of attacks , and after becoming involved with a local man ; it turns out that she is unwittingly carrying around evidence of an international crime network . Naturally , representatives from the network want to get their hands on this evidence , and so do Scotland Yard . Had this film have been tackled by someone like Alfred Hitchcock , I don't doubt that it would have been great . Hitchcock excelled with films like this , and indeed all the elements needed for a top quality thriller are present . Not that I'm putting a slur on the name of Don Sharp ; Sharp went on to direct the criminally underrated supernatural thriller ' Psychomania ' as well as a couple of Hammer Horror's best films ; Kiss of the Vampire of Rasputin : The Mad Monk before this , but he's not so great at working with this sort of material . The characters presented aren't all that interesting anyway , and Sharp doesn't succeed in putting any meat on them . Furthermore , the action is never thoroughly interesting and I have to admit that I found myself getting a bit bored on numerous occasions . The film really just plods along without a great deal of direction for the most part , and there isn't a great deal of standout moments . Discovering a forgotten film like this is always a treat , and so it is with great disappointment that I say that A Taste of Excitement isn't really worth tracking down .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: This film is a pretty good example of turning the "" buddy "" movie into a film about two women who discover a common friendship . Shelley Long is a woman who has spent years studying for a stage acting career . As pointed out in another review on this thread , her character her is like "" Diane Chambers "" in CHEERS , except that Long is not lording her superior education over everyone . She does make one exception . She is trying to get into a course led by one of the great actors of this generation ( Robert Prosky , in a clever role - he uses several accents ) , who is a Russian stage star - a "" Stanislavsky "" type . Prosky is quite selective about who comes in . He chooses Long because of her impressive resume . But he also allows in Bette Midler , who is . . . well a hooker . Bette wants to better herself , and she'd like to be an actress . But she doesn't have the background or the money ( Long has to borrow it from her parents ) . She gets in ( it is more than hinted she sold some of her wares to Prosky ) . He looks amused as he decides to include her in the course . He is an intensive acting genius , and we see him demonstrate how to be realistic in many details ( such as dying on stage ) . He is also insisting that they all take good notes , but leave their notebooks with him to be returned the following week . A hard taskmaster , he probably does know much about acting . In the meantime both Long and Midler meet Peter Coyote , and he is dating both without knowing of each other's connection . This is good , as Long and Midler dislike each other ( Long looking down on this pretentious hooker , Midler hating this overbearing overachiever ) . Then , one day , Long is accompanying Coyote out for dinner . He enters a shop , and it suddenly explodes . Long ( in deep mourning ) goes to the morgue . Shortly Midler shows up , and after a brief screaming fit between them , they discover that the corpse simply can't be Coyote - it's lacking a certain piece of evidence that it is . Midler and Long decide to join forces to find out what happened to Coyote . They can't find any assistance from the police ( who have an open and shut accidental death ) . But soon they are being pursued by Federal agents led by John Schuck . They manage to shake him off , and slowly follow the few clues they find to realize they have to cross the country to follow their lover . . . and to force him to choose between them . Eventually they do find Coyote , only to find another less pleasant side to him . And they find that half the world seems to be pursuing them as well . The film has great moments in it , such as Long using Prosky's training to fool some people , and Long and Midler playing Eastern Europeans trying to board a plane ( the right plane ) at an airport . Then there is George Carlin , who plays an American Indian with the attitudes of . . . well George Carlin , God bless him . The film is also interesting as Long and Midler , once their cooperation grows and they find what Coyote is like , discover that they really like each other more than they thought .

It's a joke with one punchline repeated far too often and after a while , it becomes tedious , at least it did to me . The first one and a-half minutes are quite funny and then it becomes repetitive and the idea just isn't clever enough in and of itself to sustain itself over the rest . Still , worth watching once .

311,"Text1: David Fincher’s fifth feature film takes him back to the territory of his second film and greatest success , SEVEN ( 1995 ) – the serial killer theme . Here , however , he concerns himself with a real-life , unsolved case which shocked – and fascinated – America for the best part of 20 years . The film is quite long at 158 minutes , but the intriguing subject matter and the incredibly detailed scrutiny of the case makes for compulsive , if occasionally heavy-going , viewing . The film basically divides itself into three sections – the first part deals with Robert Downey Jr . ’s troubled crime reporter ( he actually became a target for the killer at one point and eventually self-destructs in a haze of boozing lethargy ) , the second with the police investigation itself – conducted by Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards – and especially the effects it has on the former’s career ( he is eventually taken off the case and transferred to another division for tampering with the evidence ) and , finally , cartoonist Jake Gyllenhaal’s obsessive odyssey to decipher , track and eventually meet the Zodiac which takes its toll on his family life and costs him his job at the paper . Overall , the film is of a high quality on a technical level with any number of impressive scenes ( the opening murder sequence to the strains of Donovan’s "" Hurdy Gurdy Man "" is a cracker ) and a couple of good performances ( particularly Downey’s and Brian Cox’s psychoanalyst ) but it does have its undeniable flaws , too : the characters played by Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo come off as unsympathetic when contrasted with Downey’s effortless charisma , there is perhaps too many newspaper conferences and not enough depictions of the murders , there is certainly little or no attempt to identify the cause of Zodiac’s behavior and , after almost three hours and after all those years , the prime suspect is still the same one ( although I can’t say I was completely convinced of it myself ) despite the occasional , effective red herring ( apparently being an old movie buff is a pre-requisite for serial killer suspects ) . In hindsight , it seems incredible now that it took the various investigating forces 22 years to track down the one surviving victim of the Zodiac killings but , by that time , the prime suspect would go on to die of a heart attack . . . Finally , one thing I especially liked was that the Zodiac was apparently inspired to commit his crimes by a classic horror movie , THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME ( 1932 ) – while his own exploits themselves inspired an iconic piece of cinema , DIRTY HARRY ( 1971 ) !

Thanks to Shirl ( Zoe Trilling , quite the naughty , sexy raven-headed bad girl ) and her thuggish pranksters trick her Catholic school friends into going to a party at Hull House . Bibi ( the strawberry-blond bombshell Cristi Harris ) makes the mistake of lifting a tube of lipstick which she'll take on her person across the underground stream which forbids the demonic spirit to flee her "" spiritual circle "" . The lipstick opened by Shirl unleashes a snake-like crawler which enters her vagina while also releasing a "" spiritual smoke "" with Angela now free to roam . Perry ( Robert Jayne ) , a Catholic student whose passionate belief that demonic spirits still exist despite his feelings falling on deaf ears ( . . and annoying newly established priest , Father Bob ( Rod McCary ) ) , will find , through a type of ceremonial ritual , that Angela is alive and well . Melissa ( Merle Kennedy ) , a shy , sweet-hearted wallflower , an object of scorn by those who share sleeping quarters with her , is Angela's sister , an orphan terrified by dreams of her sister in demonic form . Angela desires to use her as a sacrifice for Satan within the hellish confines of Hull House . Those who entered Hull House on Halloween will face certain peril as Angela sets her sights on gaining the souls of each individual and it'll be up to yard-stick-toting nun , Sister Gloria ( Jennifer Rhodes ) and Perry , carrying holy-water-powered toy shooters and bombs , with the reluctant approval of a non-believing cynical Father Bob , to stop her before the unholy sacrifice is offered to Satan . The plot , as crazy as it is , services only as a means for incredible special effects . Director Brian Trenchard-Smith ( Dead-End Drive-in ) lets it all hang out with heads decapitated , holy water working as acid ( often melting those possessed into a goo-puddle of bubbling flesh and blood ) , the infamous lip stick tube releasing a computerized viper head , Angela's emerging as a demonic snake ( . . a fantastic creation whose fate regarding a cross baked to her chest as the sun rays shine through an image kicked away by Johnny from a boarded window , seems inspired by Hammer studios ' Dracula films ) , faces melting and steaming , boobs reaching to grab a victim's hand whose grasp burns , and ugly demonic make-up with those possessed attaining sickening , sharp teeth . Bare breasts are paraded for horror fans craving such images , and the cast Trenchard-Smith has available are beautiful / handsome . The Catholic church is skewered as Sister Gloria is lampooned thanks to her yard-stick which is always with her , almost an appendage , that third arm she needs as a moral crusader to keep the kids under her watch from sinning and partaking in lascivious acts . Her "" preparation scene "" resembles Rambo getting his gear and weapons together as he awaits battle with the enemy . There are even lip-locks between women , a very nice one between a possessed Sheril and Terri . . Terri , horrified at just seeing her potential boyfriend being beheaded , at first resists , only to slowly succumb to desire . And , Sheril , after the snake "" enters "" her , shares a kiss with Angela , who lifts her up in embrace . There are obvious homages to the first film like the lipstick's appearance , and another "" dance of death "" as Angela provocatively performs for the Catholic kids who were dancing away to rock music shortly after their stern disciplinarian , Sister Gloria stepped away for a moment . We even have a beheaded victim using his head as a basketball , dribbling and shooting hoops ! While attaining the same cheesy , gory , zany , sleazy spirit of the original , Trenchard-Smith has a far better cast of young adults , who aren't so annoying , with far superior special effects . And , the film isn't completely confined to Hull House , which separates it from being just a clone of the original . If you can accept this insane film's tone and aren't offended by the joyous swipes at Catholicism , then there might be some fun to be had here .

Text2: This exquisite adaptation of D . H . Lawrence's novel is famed cinematographer Jack Cardiff's most accomplished film as a director ; in fact , he was nominated and indeed won several major Best Direction awards ( including the Golden Globe ) . Sadly , none of his other directorial efforts were anywhere near as rewarding although I'd still like to watch at least 2 of them - the epic THE LONG SHIPS ( 1963 ) and the horror film THE MUTATIONS ( 1974 ; a SE DVD of which has been released under the title THE FREAKMAKER ) . Amazingly , this was a Hollywood production ( made by 20th Century Fox ) and , as such , leading man Dean Stockwell ( who was probably never better ) was imposed on Cardiff by producer Jerry Wald - though he seems to have been pleased with his performance . The acting of the Oscar-nominated Trevor Howard ( as Stockwell's boorish and drunkard coal-miner father ) and Mary Ure ( as the married but separated young suffragette with whom Stockwell has an affair ) , as well as Wendy Hiller ( as his strong but possessive mother ) , is irreproachable . The supporting cast includes Ernest Thesiger ( in one of his last films ) and Donald Pleasence , with both unfortunately having limited screen-time . Freddie Francis ' luminous black-and-white cinematography earned the film its only Oscar ; interestingly , Francis also followed in Cardiff's footsteps and became a film director himself ( with similarly erratic results , ironically enough ) . Mario Nascimbene's lovely music score and the film's vivid recreation of an era ( in authentic locations , no less ) add immeasurably to its lasting impression . The coal-mine setting recalls earlier films like Carol Reed's THE STARS LOOK DOWN ( 1939 ) and John Ford's HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY ( 1941 ) , with which it can be favorably compared . Still , for all its quaint Englishness and the inherent sentimentality of its narrative , the film is a remarkably adult and frank depiction of sexual and artistic awakening vis-à-vis repressed Edwardian society and , together with Ken Russell's equally celebrated adaptation of WOMEN IN LOVE ( 1969 ) , remains undoubtedly the finest screen rendition of D . H . Lawrence's work . It's a shame , therefore , that this is as yet unavailable on R1 DVD but the R2 edition I own is a more than adequate substitute , with a very nice-looking print of the main feature , surprisingly strong audio and , apart from the basic supplements of the original theatrical trailer and a stills gallery , features a wonderful interview with Cardiff about the making of SONS AND LOVERS ( interspersed with relevant clips from the film itself ) which clocks in at around half-an-hour .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The problems with this film are 1 ) it all has been said and shown before , 2 ) the camera work and editing are so inconsistent that they become intrusive , and 3 ) the actors selected to enact this downfall film are pretty much folks with good intentions but little finesse . Obviously made on a very low budget with a group of people who appear committed to the project , it has everything we could want from an Indie except polish . David ( Eben Gordon - unfortunately not resembling a 16-year-old boy he is supposed to be ) is trying to hold together his fragile family of adulterous father Jack ( James Early ) , an alcoholic self-destructive mother Katie ( Juanita Walsh ) , and brother and sister . Jack leaves the family for his paramour , Maryann is hospitalized for rehab after an injurious fall , the other siblings are cope less , and David attempts to escape reality by joining an acting class . The acting teacher Kenny ( Rob Moretti ) , accompanied by his close friend and confidant Maryann ( Jennifer Katz ) , encourage David's young ability and despite wise Maryann's warnings , Kenny responds to his attraction to David . Out of need for order in his life David opens up his sexuality and becomes bonded with Kenny .

It is a love / hate relationship , David becoming the movie star Kenny's drug habit prevented . And eventually David attempts to return to his family and girlfriend only to meet with disaster until in the final moments of the film we find David in a 12-step program . The ending summarizes how each of the characters ' lives stand at the present via screen statements before the credits . As said before , the film cries to be loved but the technical aspects of its creation simply fall short of the much-needed chemistries that this inexperienced cast is unable to deliver . It may be an example of the writer losing the necessary distance from the final product by being over-extended in the making of the film . Grady Harp

Text2: ARISAN ( The Gathering ) is a fine little story about the ins and outs of Jakarta's wealthy class - sort of an Indonesian Beverly Hills 90210 / Melrose Place sitcom . The characters include frustrated wives , jealous wives , career women , cheating husbands , man-hunter girls , and two gay men - one closeted and one open . The film explores the social dictates of society and the jumbled events that occur when family or friends try to match make . The cast is young and attractive and handles the material well . The problem with the film is the emphasis on clothes , fancy homes , cars , and all the trappings of the wealthy class . An ' arisan ' is a gathering where friends come together , pitch in $100 . each and pass the hostessing around to various locales where their main conversation is fairly shallow gossiping . But this film , though drowning in the over-the-top trappings , has many sensitive issues well discussed and played . For a film from Indonesia it is a terrific change from the usual horror flicks that originate from their studios and as such bodes well for a new movie industry that obviously has the ability to become important . It is funny , tender , very colorful and entertaining : some judicious editing could have pared this overly long movie into a fine little film . In Indonesian and English with subtitles .

314,"Text1: As an action adventure , Spike Lee's "" Inside Man "" delivers the goods with a mysterious bank heist that has more at it's center than meets the eye . You realize there's something a bit different about Clive Owen's character Dalton , allowing hostages to go free at points in the film when it serves his unique purpose . For his part , Detective Keith Frazier ( Denzel Washington ) comes across a few dots that refuse to connect , and can't get over the feeling that this is a bank heist that's not a bank heist . For me , the mark of a good actor or actress is how they make you feel about the character they're portraying . In that regard , I was fairly repulsed by the smarmy brashness and curt innuendo of Jody Foster's Madeline White character . Her performance was masterful as a behind the scenes power broker , known by reputation and called personally by the president of the bank under siege . She can read between the lines as well as anyone , and you don't quite believe it when she says she won't do anything illegal to earn her payday . It occurred to me as I did the math that we're quickly coming to a time when real time stories with themes from World War II are nearly at an end . Arthur Case ( Christopher Plummer ) would have to be about eighty five for his character to make sense , so one wonders why he might have kept the reminders of his Nazi connections in a safe deposit box of his bank for over sixty years . Of course without it there's no story , so an appropriate grain of salt is necessary here . "" Inside Man "" is the kind of film that begs for a repeat viewing that allows one to now concentrate on the character relationships that the first time might have seemed unimportant or unconnected . In particular , there are some head scratching scenes offered that seem to suggest "" what might happen "" if the police storm the bank , with one shot zeroing in on a blood splattered lock box 392 . At that point in time , detective Frazier still didn't know what was at the core of the caper . I've read some of the posts that take the movie to task for lack of back story and the unknown background and motivation of the Owens and Foster characters . I can live with that in a film that already takes a couple of hours to tell it's story . The action is intense when it needs to be , and demands your attention to keep up with key elements . The film winds up being just clever enough to be exciting and entertaining , and there are times when that's good enough for me .

Text2: Repeat viewings of "" Key Largo "" will only enrich your appreciation of it . The superb cast and directing by John Huston make this a must see film for fans of the 1940 classics , particularly fans of stars Humphrey Bogart , Edward G . Robinson , and Lauren Bacall . Bogey and Bacall made four films in a space of four years , this being their final appearance together . Bogey's character , retired Army Major Frank McCloud seeks out the family of a war buddy killed in action . He finds Nora Temple ( Bacall ) and her father James Temple ( Lionel Barrymore ) as the owners of a seasonal hotel in Key Largo , and comes to realize that all is not quite right in the serene setting . Bogey's response to an inquisitive Nora Temple is about to be tested - "" Life on land has become too complicated for my taste "" . Edward G . Robinson's appearance as mobster Johnny Rocco is suitably delayed in the film to build suspense , and he breaks on screen with all of his classic nuance - the sneer , the braggadocio , the "" What's with you wise guy ? "" sarcasm . Rocco suffers from a fall from past glory , a time when he was regarded as "" the one and only "" , a virtual emperor of the crime world . Now he's a two bit hoodlum , holed up in a Key Largo hotel , hoping to cash in on a counterfeit money scam . With him are a coterie of henchmen , and an alcoholic moll superbly portrayed by Claire Trevor , earning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance . Johnny Rocco is desperate to make a mob connection to unload his counterfeit money stash , and refuses to submit to the might of an impending hurricane . Fueling Rocco's desperation is a stoic Bogart - "" You don't like it Rocco - the storm ; show it your gun why don't ya , if it doesn't stop , shoot it ! "" . Helpless in the face of the coming storm , Rocco's anxiety mounts , and in a tense scene he confronts war hero McCloud by throwing him a gun to force a showdown . But Bogey's not buying it - "" One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for "" . In a damned if you do , damned if you don't situation , McCloud must decide to man a boat to Cuba for Rocco's gang to make a getaway . In the one improbable scene of the film , Trevor's Gaye Dawn character secretly maneuvers Rocco's gun away from him and slips it into Bogey's hand , while surrounded by all of the bad guys . How Rocco would not have missed his weapon ( until later on the boat ) is an element that is not suitably dealt with in the film . McCloud's resourcefulness while skippering the getaway boat is sheer cunning , taking out one mobster after another with surgical precision . The desperate Johnny Rocco even shoots one of his own men rather than have his authority challenged . McCloud remains silent to Rocco's taunts , causing the gangster to force his own hand and become a target for the heroic McCloud . As Bogey heads back to port and the hurricane fades , the film ends on a feel good note as Nora Temple opens the shutters of the hotel and the sunlight streams in - all is well in the world again ; the symbolism is extraordinary . Bogey and Robinson appear in four other movies together ( Kid Galahad , Brother Orchid , The Amazing Dr . Clitterhouse , and Bullets or Ballots ) , but this is the only one in which they share equal footing , Robinson cast in the lead role in the other films over Bogart . For Robinson fans , the Clitterhouse film is a blast and is recommended to see him in an offbeat role . Another point of interest for film buffs , Jay Silverheels appears in an uncredited role as Tom Osceola , one of the Seminole Indian brothers on the lam from the law in the movie's back story . For an actor as typecast as Silverheels ( Tonto in the Lone Ranger ) , it's always a pleasant surprise and treat to see in an entirely different setting . "" Key Largo "" ranks right up there with "" Treasure of the Sierra Madre "" and "" The Maltese Falcon "" , and perhaps just a notch below "" Casablanca "" among Bogart's finest films , and a true classic worthy of the name .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Linda is the sister of Humphrey Bogart's character Jim Leonard , a former flight instructor with bigger things on his mind , as he seeks financial backing for his new airplane motor that he touts as the "" greatest motor in the world "" . The only trouble is , wealthy businessman Bruce Hardy ( Hale Hamilton ) , who's willing to back Leonard , is also backing the penniless Carol Owen , who is completely in the dark about her financial situation . Hardy wants to marry Owen , even as he entertains an occasional dalliance with actress Lee , all without the knowledge of any of the other players . When Jim Leonard meets Carol , he is immediately smitten with her looks and charm , and begins spending time with her at the expense of the new company he's just formed . But there's a nagging feeling in the back of his mind that he's just not worthy of big spender and girl about town Carol . There's a well done counterpoint at the beginning of the film when Carol first meets Jim . She requests him for her first flying lesson , and he obliges by performing some daring flight stunts , chock full of rolls and dives . As Carol turns green ( you can tell , even though the film is black and white ) , she returns the favor once on the ground by giving Jim a harrowing ride into town in her roadster . At sixty eight minutes , the film is probably just a bit too short to effectively tell it's tale . There are a number of quick cuts and fades that create a somewhat choppy feel , though they are coherently done and maintain the flow of the story . In what could have been a disastrous ending , Carol , unwilling to marry Hardy for his money , and too embarrassed to come crawling to Jim , leaves a suicide note for airport manager Gilligan . As can be guessed , Jim races after Carol who's about to take off for a one way solo flight , and manages to create some tension as he hangs on for dear life of his own before scrambling into the cockpit of the airborne plane . The movie closes on the two lovebirds as they head off into the skies , Bogey thumbs up to indicate everything will be A-OK . Humphrey Bogart had five films under his belt by the time "" Love Affair "" was released . This would actually be his first leading role , and though capably done , it would be a few more years before he got to portray real meaty characters like Duke Mantee in "" The Petrified Forest "" ( 1936 ) , and "" Bugs "" Fenner in the gangster drama "" Bullets or Ballots "" ( 1936 ) . As a Bogey fan , I recommend them all , even if you're not .

Right , Jack Neo ? Each installment of the franchise share links with one another only in the title of the movie timestamped with the year , and its ending with the usual fanfare song and dance to usher in the Lunar New Year as well . And the second movie in 1993 was actually filmed in Singapore's now defunct and demolished Tang Dynasty City , being one of the rare ( if not the only ) film to have been done in its entirety at the location . Clifton Ko , who had been assuming directorial duties then , has now turned it over to Vincent Kok , while together with Raymond Wong , they retain producer credits . Just how zany or irreverent this addition to the franchise can become ? Unlike the previous films , the number of direct references for spoof purposes is much more obscure . Gone are the blatant in your face sight gags played just for laughs , and though there are the much touted scenes of emulating Daniel Craig's bare bodied emergence from the sea in Casino Royale , the actual scene is contrary to what the movie still would have you believe . Other references and cameo appearances / spoofs also take on a much subtler approach , so for an audience who blinked , you can forget about any rip-roaring laughter from start to end . But of course as a comedy , one can't fault the script for trying to piece everything together , resulting in one crazy and messy approach . A huge leaf taken from the Will Smith vehicle Hitch forms the central premise , where a love guru dispenses advice to his clients to help them achieve their objectives , while at the same time finding trouble to practice what he is teaching . Louis Koo's Koo Chai is the Asian Hitch equivalent with some hypnotic powers , being paid by Ronald Cheng's Kei to help his sister Sandra ( Sandra Ng ) get married , so that he can break the family curse that befalls each of his fiancées . The principles of seduction get into full swing to charm the successful alpha-female with a zilch love life in routines that you can see coming from miles away . There are however , some excellent one-off scenes , and my personal favourites are the dining table identity crisis scene , as well as a gambling one involving Raymond Wong ( given top billing here although he appears only from the halfway mark ) , Lee Heung-Kam and Sandra's real life dad Ha Chun-Chau , the latter two being her on-screen parents . I guess the filmmakers were quite unsure whether new faces could carry the franchise , so they had to rely on the tried and tested veterans , though folks like Sandra seem to be playing yet another usual character seen in many of her movies . Ronald Cheng though is a personal revelation and has quite the rubber face . Don't go expecting plenty of hearty laughter , as the set pieces do look more juvenile rather than genuinely funny , and are more misses than hitting the mark .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
320,"Text1: A young accomplished headmistress of a Parisian village , Miss Helen ( Stéphane Audran ) , is in a conundrum . . she's in love with a serial killer , Paul ( Jean Yanne ) , the local butcher , who has been stabbing young females in the surrounding area with a knife , leaving bloody corpses . Stumped Police Inspector Grumbach ( Roger Rudel ) questions Helen after a second murder of a local girl married to a teacher she knows , Leon ( Mario Beccara ) , bleeds upon the head of a student after a field trip into a cavern looking at prehistoric paintings . Helen confiscates a key piece of evidence linking Paul to the crime . . a cigarette lighter she gave him for his birthday . What started as a blossoming romance between two people soon darkens as Helen must fear that Paul's homicidal tendencies could endanger her own well being . My first Claude Chabrol thriller was a nice surprise . It's really more of a character study , a kind of "" opposites attract "" romance develops regarding how two completely different people find a mutual growing friendship and love for one another despite their glaring differences . Audran is a revelation , completely believable , as this elegant , refined , sophisticated lady who is absolutely realistic as the headmistress . Yanne looks like your typical working-class butcher , walking with a slouch , often discussing the horrors of war , but very mannered , guarded as to not say too much , yet appealing in a quiet way . I like how they find this pleasant rapport with each other . I think the decision to shoot in such a minimalist manner , from the performances to the style , enhances the film . . like a good Hitchcock thriller , Chabrol is even able to create a type of McGuffen regarding the first murder as we follow Helen and Paul's bonding , the way they meet each other ( . . stopping by each other's place of employment as they work ) , spending time together , disregarding the village uproar about the vicious slaying , acknowledging it in a subdued way . I think that's perhaps the most interesting aspect of the thriller . . the way neither Helen or Paul dwell on the murder until they have no other choice . For a while the only way you could tell it was a potential thriller was the very moody , rather chilling score . I think another aspect which worked for me was the idea that a killer was close by and that Helen was the main focus of the film . . Chabrol never leaves her , and the threat towards her life was quite vivid . I appreciate Chabrol's unpretentious direction . . he doesn't call attention to himself , allowing the characters and story to grip you instead .

Text2: I had heard the title many times , and then I found out that the twice Oscar winning female star of The Silence of the Lambs was in it , and I thought why not . Set in the 1930's , this story is loosely based on the gangster exploits ( e . g . Al Capone ) during the Prohibition era , but all characters are played by children , no adults at all , unless you count the singing voice of Paul Williams . Basically the film centres on the ongoing gang battle between ( named because of his physique ) Fat Sam ( John Cassisi ) and ( named because of his classy fashion sense ) Dandy Dan ( Martin Lev ) , and both are fighting to have the best weapons to take out their threats , i . e . the custard pies , and the essential "" splurge gun "" . Bugsy Malone ( Scott Baio ) is around during this conflict , he starts as a bystander , a penniless boxing promoter down on his luck , but he gets a job for Fat Sam as a driver , and he agrees to help with whatever he wants . Bugsy also meets his love interest , Blousey Brown ( Florrie Dugger ) , who is ambitious to be a film star in Hollywood . Bugsy makes the money she needs to take her their , but he is mugged and money stolen . He was rescued after this mugging by Leroy Smith ( Paul Murphy ) , who has boxing talent , so Bugsy trains him as a boxer , and Leroy becomes his unofficial sidekick . Oh , Blousey also gets jealous when she sees Bugsy flirting with Fat Sam's girlfriend and lead singer , Tallulah ( twice BAFTA winning "" newcomer "" , 14-year-old Jodie Foster ) . Also starring Albin ' Humpty ' Jenkins as Fizzy , Davidson Knight as Cagey Joe , Sheridan Earl Russell as Knuckles , Paul Chirelstein as Smolsky / Boxer ; Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ' Dexter Fletcher as Baby Face , Vivienne McKone as Velma , Helen Corran as Bangles , Andrew Paul as O'Dreary , and an uncredited Phil Daniels as Waiter who spills spaghetti . The acting is pretty good for youngsters , the songs are quite fun , the pie and cream fights are always a treat , and young Foster proves to be worthy to-be movie star . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Paul Williams , it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design / Art Direction , Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track , and it was nominated the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music , Best Costume Design , Best Direction for Alan Parker ( Fame ) and Best Film , Parker was nominated the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy , Best Original Score and Best Original Song for Williams ' "" Bugsy Malone "" .

322,"Text1: This was one of those episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE that were shown on Friday , July 4th on the Science Fiction Station . The episode dealt with a classic horror tale that keeps going around the world as urban myth , and will probably still be doing so 100 years from now , along with the alligators in our urban sewers . Barbara Nichols is Liz Powers , a successful nightclub dancer-performer , whose agent Barney ( Fredd Wayne ) has just signed her up for a nice new gig in Miami . But she is suffering from overwork , and needs bed rest . While in the hospital she starts having a recurring nightmare where she is aware that it is dark as night , but the clock reads 8 : 10 P . M . She hears nothing . She reaches for a glass of water and it falls and breaks . No nurse comes in so she goes out to investigate . She sees a nurse all the way down the hall going into a room . She follows and finds it is the hospital morgue . The nurse ( Arlene Martel ) reappears and faces her with an attractive but sinister face . "" Room for one more honey ? "" , she says . Nichols feeling she is confronting great evil lets out a piercing scream , and the next thing she knows she is being held down by another nurse and the hospital doctor ( Jonathan Harris ) on her bed . This happens three nights in a row . Harris tries to reassure Nichols that there is no reason for her to have this fear - he shows her the night nurse ( Norma Connelly ) , who does not look at all like the figure in the dream . Nichols really is not convinced , and finds that her agent is not really good in helping her feel any sense of relief either . Then Harris suggests something to Nichols . In all three of her dreams the pattern remained the same - vary it : Don't reach for the glass of water . Nichols , still dubious , goes to bed , and again , at 8 : 10 P . M . she wakes . She almost reaches for the glass , but remembers what Harris suggested . Instead she decides to smoke a cigarette instead . But in putting the lighter down on the table , she knocks over the glass again . She decides to see if her varying the situation has any effect . She walks down the hall , and again the entire dream plays out with the sinister nurse . She is seen screaming as Harris gives her a sedative injection . But in the course of her screaming she does say something that Harris is puzzled about . She mentions "" 22 "" , and Harris knows of a Room 22 that the patients never see . SPOILER COMING UP : Nichols leaves the next day . She is looking forward to the Miami gig . She reaches the airport and is given her ticket , and then learns that she is booked on flight 22 . This is unsettling , as is the fact she notices the time is now 8 : 10 P . M . She walks somewhat unsteadily and knocks into a woman carrying a vase with flowers , which she causes to fall and break . Suddenly Nichols is really getting frightened , as key events of that dream seem to be reoccurring in a different setting . An airport employee points out that her plane is getting ready to leave . Nichols stumbles down to the ramp up to the plane's entrance , and a stewardess is there - it is Martel , and smiling the same way she asks , "" Room for one more honey ? "" Nichols screams and runs down the ramp and back to the main building of the airport . A moment later the plane bursts into flames before a horrified Nichols and the others in the building . TWENTY TWO was one of six TWILIGHT ZONE episodes that were shot on video tape , and it certainly adds an "" odd dimension "" to the viewing pleasure of it . Because of the fuzzy quality of the episode's appearance it makes the turmoil of Nichols ' apparent mental breakdown more effective . But it also reminds us of the live television that was so much a part of the 1950s , and of which so much is now lost or missing . In particular watching Nichols deepening fears get realized , and the growing uncertainty of the intelligent skeptical Harris , we are lucky to see them almost as if they were freshly performing in front of us . Wayne too is good as a nice fellow who really can't make out what is going on with his client and friend , but blunderingly keeps trying to move on . And Martel does the most with her limited appearances in the episode . The episode was based on an anecdote that Bennett Cerf put into one of his anthologies . But it may seem familiar to viewers of the film DEAD OF NIGHT , when in the first episode of the film a racing car driver is recovering in a hospital and has a recurring nightmare where he awakes at a given time , looks out the window and sees a hearse driven by Miles Mander dressed as an undertaker , who looks up at the patient and says , "" Only room for one more , Sir ! "" In the end the racer , after he leaves the hospital , almost boards a double decker bus and sees the conductor is Mander , repeating , "" Only room for one more , Sir ! "" . Wisely he does not board , and watches in horror as the bus ( in avoiding a collision ) falls off a bridge . I have seen the anecdote appear in collections of "" odd but true "" books frequently . I don't care if it is really a false story - it is a damned good one .

Text2: Confined to a single set , the master Alfred Hitchcock directs a compelling psychological drama that uniquely challenges the viewer to reflect on his own reactions to the events presented on screen . In the early going , would you have thrown the German overboard , or acted as a humanitarian ? What about later , after Willy ( Walter Slezak ) is exposed as a scheming Nazi captain deftly maneuvering the boat to his own country's supply ship ? Would you have the stomach to assist in cutting off a man's leg ? The movie doesn't allow much time to think about it , but that's how life works sometimes . The film opened to immediate critical acclaim during it's first week of release , however when a negative reviewer opted to focus on the treatment of Willy's character , it called into question whether the story was sympathizing with the Nazi cause . Fearing even further backlash , Fox studio head Darryl Zanuck withdrew the film from general release . To my mind , the issue was dealt with rather expertly in the story . Even though Willy was a cunning schemer who took control of the boat during a storm , he sealed his own fate by going too far to keep Gus ( William Bendix ) quiet . Hitchcock accepted a rather difficult task in taking on this assignment . Restricted to just one set , he employed what was until then the most extensive story boarding ever utilized for a movie . The entire movie was drawn out ahead of time , with a myriad of camera angles and weather related elements to convey something different in practically each scene . It works exceptionally well , as one is never left bored with static images or a fixation on any single character or situation . As for characters , the one cast member with any name recognition at the time was Tallulah Bankhead , who portrayed the journalist Constance Porter . Bankhead was extremely difficult for the other players to work with , and she lorded her celebrity status over all of them . Staffers on the film were intimidated by her name dropping , yet in Hitchcock , she found a kindred spirit , someone she could talk with endlessly on the set . For those who scour Hitch's films for his cameo appearances , "" Lifeboat "" presented a dilemma , but that was overcome with a little gimmickry . During this time , Hitchcock was trying to lose weight , succeeding in going from three hundred pounds down to two hundred . In the movie , Kovac ( John Hodiak ) is shown reading a newspaper , and the camera lingers on an ad for ' Reduco ' , a weight loss product and ' Obesity Slayer ' . The director's full frame profile is used for the before and after comparison , prompting numerous viewers of the time to inquire where they could buy the product , but of course it was all made up . If ever there was a film that employs symbolism , this one is a treasure trove . It was interesting to me that the first time one gets a view of the entire open sea is right after it's revealed that Mrs . Higley's ( Heather Angel ) baby is dead . That effectively places the boat's survivors in touch with their own mortality in what might be a hopeless situation . What does it mean when the lone black Joe ( Canada Lee ) doesn't participate in the gang up on Willy ? Gus changes his name from Schmidt to Smith . The prospect of life giving fresh rain is replaced by sunshine instead of a storm , but which is better ? There is something meaningful and fascinating to be taken away from this film in virtually every instance . If all that weren't enough , it was an unusual coincidence of timing that had me see this film when I did . The Cardinals captured the 2006 baseball World Series just a couple of days ago by defeating the Detroit Tigers , four games to one . In the story , William Bendix ' character Gus ruminates on the state of baseball at that time with - "" St . Louie's the team to watch this year "" !","{""output"": ""NO""}"
324,"Text1: Successful lampooning of formula-based slasher movies stars Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott , a traumatized teenager whose mother was slaughtered one year ago . Then , almost one year to the day after , her classmates are systematically ( and brutally ) murdered by a costumed lunatic who likes to taunt his victims over the phone and play slasher-movie trivia . I think the main hook of this movie is its willingness to show how ridiculous the cliches of the slasher movie are : Have Sex , You Die . Do Drugs Or Booze , You Die . Go Off On Your Own To Investigate A Strange Noise . . . You Die . Having a sense of humor ( especially a satirical one ) definitely helps this movie . It's also reasonably suspensful and well-crafted , with a troupe of attractive , Generation-Y actors as the principal characters ( is is just me , or does anybody else find Matthew Lillard's character Stu Macher REALLY annoying ? ) . Also noteworthy are two uncredited cameos by . . . hey , I'd better not give that away . Giant in-joke has director Wes Craven himself in a cameo role ( you have to see it to believe it ) .

Text2: Robert Bresson's Pickpocket has many great moments , even as it didn't quite do it for me on a first viewing as a ' masterpiece ( some have said to see it twice , perhaps I will ) . Bresson's use of the camera is often intoxicating in the most subdued of ways ; at times it does take on the prowess of literature . But my only minor nitpick with the film is that it leaves a sort of cold viewing on a viewer , with such simplicity and emotions stripped from the character ( s ) that it's hard to connect . And yet , this is really made up tenfold with the sort of style that can be likely called Bressonian ; straightforward angles , tense medium close-ups , serene editing , and little to no music . Whatever it sets up for this actor to do , it sets up well . Indeed , the actor who plays the protagonist here is actually very good , aside from the disconnection , and provides an excellent way for us to get along his side . He is a decent person , but there are certain things that get to him , which is why he feels he must steal . At times I almost had a grin as he made some successful grabs , by himself or his cohorts . Was I rooting for him , or just pleased by the pay-off of Bresson's suspense ? Maybe both ; there is definitely one truly virtuoso sequence in the film , when the pickpockets go on the train . Like A Man Escaped , the only other Bresson film I've seen , there is that sort of dissection , quietly and without really digging too deep , into what a man wants with his life , or doesn't want . While the hero has only one determination in Man Escaped , to get out , Pickpocket has a man who doesn't know what to do with himself , only coming to a genuine catharsis behind bars . I think I like Pickpocket a little more , but I may like it even more on another viewing .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

327,"Text1: Army of Darkness starts where Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) finishes with Ash ( Bruce Campbell ) finding himself stranded in the thirteenth century after he was transported back in time , there he is mistaken for an enemy warrior by Lord Arthur ( Marcus Gilbert ) & his men & taken prisoner . Back at Lord Arthur's castle Ash learns that unspeakable evils are terrorising Lord Arthur's people , in order to get back to the twentieth century & to rid the land of the evil Deadites Ash must undertake a quest to find the Necronomicon , or the Book of the Dead as Ash know's it . Ash has to go it alone as he faces trouble from the evil dead & the book itself along the way as he tries to get back home . . . Co-edited , co-written & directed by Sam Raimi this is the third film in his Evil Dead franchise , also known under the title Army of Darkness : The Medieval Dead & shot under the working title of Evil Dead 3 the actual Evil Dead title apparently wasn't eventually able to be used due to copyright & legal problems caused by the collapse of the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group who financed Evil Dead II & co-produced this while it was still in business . To be honest with a distinct change in title there's a distinct change in tone as well since Army of Darkness simply didn't feel like an Evil Dead film to me or at least what I felt an Evild Dead film should feel like . While the first two Evil Dead films were classic black comedy horror films with with lots of gore Army of Darkness tones the gore & horror down to virtually nothing & instead ups the slapstick comedy & visual gags to an almost unbearable level & as such Army of Darkness feels more like a Three Stooges ( writer & director Raimi has often stated The Three Stooges were a major influence on him ) outing featuring a few monsters . To be fair the film is quite likable & there are a few moments which might make some laugh but for me there were far more misses than hits in the joke & gags department & I really miss the horror & gore of the previous Evil Dead films . The films plot is also very poor when analyzed , Ash's quest doesn't seem that difficult & why didn't either Lord Arthur & his men or the Deadites retrieve the Necronomicon already ? If they knew where the book was & how to safely get why didn't they ? Why did they need to send Ash ? Why didn't the bad guy's grab it already ? The romance between Ash & Sheila feels pointless & why did they change the start & make it different to the end of Evil Dead II where Ash shoots that flying monster ? Confusingly Army of Darkness surely must be a contender for the film with the most alternate versions , there are theatrical cuts , TV versions , director's cuts all containing / missing / adding / removing unique material & to add to the confusion there's two different endings which seem to get used almost at random depending where you live . To be honest the differences are purely cosmetic , there's no change of story between most of the different version apart from the ending which is substantially altered . Most of the deleted / added scenes are just extension's of existing sequences or minor added scenes that don't affect the story too much . While I didn't find Army of darkness funny or particularly clever I was also disappointed with it's very overblown jovial atmosphere as opposed to the intense horror & gore of the previous Evil Dead films , to be honest there's no horror or gore here to speak of & this would surely rate as a ' PG ' these days . Made at a time before CGI computer effects most of the ambitious effects sequences are achieved through matte paintings , composites & stop-motion animation . The stop-motion animated skeletons remind heavily of Ray Harryhausen's brilliant sequence from Jason and the Argonauts ( 1963 ) also featuring skeletons . The film has a fun visual style with Raimi using all sorts of camera tricks & editing techniques . With a supposed $11 , 000 , 000 budget Army of darkness was by far the biggest budgeted Evil Dead film to date & Raimi uses the money to create an all out war film set in a medieval fantasy setting culminating in an epic battle between good & evil . The film bombed at the box-office & it's not difficult to see why to be honest . The acting is alright , Bruce Campbell has screen presence & is likable in this as he delivers the one-liners with aplomb while Bridget Fonda has a small role at the start . Army of Darkness is occasionally fun & it certainly moves along like a rocket with barely a dull moment but somehow it just didn't do it for me , I didn't find it that funny & I really missed the intense horror , monsters , slime & gore of the previous films . Wathable but very silly & not entirely satisfying . According to the IMDb another sequel titled Evil Dead IV ( 2011 ) is currently in development .

Text2: Quincy M . E . : Double Death starts as the Los Angeles county coroner's office is inundated after a fire at the Cresent Club has killed fifteen people who all need to be identified , Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) , Sam ( Robert Ito ) & Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) are rushed off their feet but get the job done under enormous pressure . Once the work is complete Quincy argues with Asten that they are understaffed & they are ill equipped to deal with such emergencies & storms off , Asten himself is about to leave when another body comes in that was initially missed & Asten decides to do the autopsy himself . The body turns out to be the owner of the club Mike Ryan & Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) is desperate to pin his murder & the fire to local gangster Solly Arkoff ( Joseph Perry ) & Asten's findings seem to pint to murder which the DA act on . However the next morning Quincy takes a look at Ryan's body & comes to a different conclusion that could ruin Asten's reputation & set Arkoff free . . . Episode 18 from season 3 this Quincy story was directed by Robert Douglas & I have to say that Double Death is one of my very favourite Quincy episodes . It has everything that makes the show so great for me , it has a good storyline with lots of mystery elements , Quincy turns detective to solve a crime using his medical & forensic skills , the regulars character's are spot on , at fifty minutes it moves along at a nice pace , the eventual outcome is in the balance right up until the end , the case provides a very personal edge for Quincy & it's hilariously funny at times . The scenes when Quincy meets the apartment manager are pure gold , the apartment manager never says anything other than ' yeah ' & it becomes a funny running gag . Sure the script makes sure Quincy ask's questions that could simply have ' yeah ' answers but it's still very funny & a true classic Quincy moment . Then there's the scene towards the end when Quincy visits a seedy strip club complete with 70's porn music , a go-go dancer on stage & a black jive speaking DJ ! Really funny stuff but an important factor is that you laugh with it rather than at it , one of the funniest episodes from Quincy's entire eight season run I would say . Then there's the subplot about Quincy having to rescue Asten's reputation in court from a rushed autopsy & while there's never any doubt that he will it gives the episode another good angle as it involves character's who any fan of the show will be familiar with . All in all Double Death is a very good , very funny & very entertaining Quincy episode which I throughly recommend . I must admit I didn't think the go-go dancers looked that nice & for a strip club they kept too many clothes on . As usual the episode is well made & shot but rather bland & forgettable , it's competent but little else . The acting is good in this one & it's always great to see Klugman on top form trying to find the truth & the scenes with him & the apartment manager ( played by Frank Campanella who appeared in five Quincy episodes as a guest star ) who only says ' yeah ' are very funny . Double Death is one of my favourite Quincy episodes , it's very funny & there's a great mystery plot as well that Quincy has to use his skills to solve . It's all here , everything that made the show so great , definitely recommend .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
328,"Text1: Rainer Werner Fassbinder's quietly powerful film is a sort-of remake of Douglas Sirk's "" All That Heaven Allows , "" a film and director greatly admired by Fassbinder , but it has a sharper edge than Sirk's film . In "" Ali : Fear Eats the Soul , "" the couple fighting a society's prejudice and resentment of their unconventional love must fight some of their own prejudices as well . In Sirk's film , the only thing imposing on the complete happiness of Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson was the busy-body ostracism of family and friends who didn't approve of the relationship between a rich society widow and her working-class gardener . In "" Ali , "" Fassbinder suggests that happiness isn't something that's gained from the approval of others , but rather is the responsibility of the individuals involved . One of the things I liked best about this film is that as the German society gets used to the unconventional romance and begins to accept our two protagonists , the couple themselves begin to struggle to maintain a grip on the happiness they thought would be their's by right . Fassbinder's unconventional couple are a frumpy German widow and a Moroccan immigrant 10-15 years younger than her . I gather from this film that Moroccans ( or Arabs in general ) were about as hated and feared in Germany at the time of this film's release as blacks were in America during the worst of the civil rights movement . So you can imagine how the couple's initial courting and subsequent marriage is handled by their neighbors , friends and family . Fassbinder himself was gay , and many suggest that the film is an allegory for the way homosexuals were persecuted . Fassbinder's private life undoubtedly informed his film , but the movie is really more universal than that . It really applies to anyone who's ever suffered the judgement of a group of people over something that didn't even affect those people , and really , who can honestly say that they've never been subjected to that ? Fassbinder directs in a low-key , unfussy style , yet he creates images and scenes that linger in the head long after the film is over . It's a lovely film , very well acted , scripted and directed . It's not exactly sad , because it argues that societies are able eventually to adapt to new things and accept things they originally rejected . But it's not exactly happy either , because it suggests that relationships don't necessarily become easier just because external obstacles are removed .

Text2: In watching Robin Williams's comedy specials from the 80's , I was struck by how much I didn't actually laugh . Considering it was his prime , a lot of the time I didn't quite ' get ' or really just take in most of the jokes he was doing , as a lot of them had him going out into the audience and just ragging on random people's items . Ironically enough he shines in this special , taking on so many topics it would make your head spin for me to list them all . But he's constantly moving here , like in his 80's specials , while still giving the audience some room to breathe here and there , without pounding over the head . He goes after plastic surgery , South American Soccer , the French , ( a bit before it started churning up ) the US and the Middle East / Iraq , and very memorably a tale of Jesus and his forgotten brother , Jerry . Even when one isn't laughing , it's still putting-a-grin kind of material he's working with . In the year last when he was really on fire ( he at least had one good film among three , Death to Smoochy , Insomnia , and One Hour Photo , the latter two in my top 10 of 2002 ) , for me he delivered his best in quite a long time , a wonderful comeback with enough sarcasm , energy , and curses to float a sinking boat .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

With director Sam Raimi , you know it's done with a lot of tongue-and-check , if not totally tongue-in-cheek . If not , it would have to be classified as one of the all - time dumbest movies ever made . If it weren't the language ( Bruce Campbell , in the lead , provides lots of profanity ) , this would be a film little kids would love with all the non-stop action and Three Stooges-like slapstick humor . The violence is so prevalent it just gets too much and the film is only 80 minutes long ! The humor helps take off some of the edge of the violence . What you have is a medieval-horror-comedy film with Campbell fighting an army of skeletons , a la Jason And The Argonauts . Campbell is best at making goofy faces . Embeth Davidtz provides the romantic interest .

330,"Text1: While I've yet to see all of what many consider to be THE document of 20th century Olympics in Riefensthal's Olympia ( it is , of course , a very long movie , and we only saw bits in a class ) , this document of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics by Kon Ichikawa is quite the spectacle on its own . Ichikawa understands something that five years later Michael Wadleigh , director of Woodstock , would understand about filming an event ( though Woodstock will always be the better , more incredibly watchable film for me ) . And it is , simply put , to make it an EVENT - in bold letters - for people who may not even really usually watch the Olympics . The way he uses his many , many , many cameras an exhaustively large crew is staggering , and just in the first half hour or so , when the countries all line up and the audience fills in as the games kick off , it's done in a very dynamic style . He alternates interestingly between big wide shots of the crowds ( like Woodstock , seeming larger than it really is with everyone packed in thousands of masses ) , the stadium itself , and then to close-ups of individuals and bodies moving . It's this side of the film , the technical one , that is most worthwhile to see in the film . If it's less than perfect , it's because , frankly , it almost does become ' too much ' to see so many games that go on in the near three-hour running time . And the narration voice that pops up now and again sounds way too much like a narrator from old newsreels , trying to add emphasis where it's not really needed . It's too immense an event with too many goals vied for victory to add on extra words . But there are highlights though , such as the 100 meter dash , done in a slow-motion that might echo some of Ichikawa's other narrative films . And the Joe Frazier boxing match , while brief , is memorable . Sometimes Tokyo Olympiad comes off almost like an avant-garde film as much as it does just straight-on documentary , and it's here that I got drawn in . Of all major events involving sports and other games and activities and trials and such , the Olympics brings together all cultures for the sake of competing for a country's honor and respect , and Ichikawa has a very good balance between showing that and adding a distinct style to the numerous events . In fact , Ichikawa has what might be the best avant-garde sports documentary ever made , at least in the past forty or so years .

Text2: ' Amelia and Michael ' is a short film that gets in , tells its story with a punch , then gets out again with minimal frippery . The opening shot is a tight close-up of Amelia's eye as she applies her mascara ; actress Natasha Powell apparently did this while looking directly into the camera , without the aid of a mirror to guide her mascara wand . Amelia and Michael are a young attractive London couple ; Michael is evidently some sort of high-powered executive , about to depart on a business trip to Milan . We ultimately learn very little about this couple and their marriage ; the film's 10-minute running time doesn't enable much development . While Michael is away in Milan , Amelia visits a young man in hospital who appears to be in a coma . Actress Powell expertly conveys Amerlia's devotion to this man , yet we learn nothing at all about their connexion . Is he related to her in some fashion ? Is he perhaps a former lover ? Or is he merely a friend ? I wanted to know more about this undeveloped subplot , and I wish that the film could have devoted more running time to this . SPOILERS COMING . It develops that Michael's business trip to ' Milan ' is actually an overnight tryst ( much closer to home ) with another woman . Again , we learn nothing about her : is she a prostitute , or are she and Michael having an ongoing affair ? Amelia is a very attractive blonde who apparently loves her husband deeply , so I was curious about Michael's reason for cheating on her . ( And the film never explains this . ) After Michael returns home , Amelia checks his passport and discovers that there's no visa for the visit to Milan . ( She made a point of checking , which implies some suspicion on Amelia's part . ) Actor Anthony Head portrays Michael as a man of intelligence , so I wonder why Michael would spin a porky that his wife could rumble so easily . The climax of this brief film is powerful . . . but less powerful than it might have been , due to an unfortunate editing decision . I've seen several films by director Daniel Cormack ; in general , he shows a strong instinct for putting his camera in exactly the right place . Here , though , his instinct fails him . As Amelia charges down a corridor towards the final confrontation , Cormack repeatedly intercuts between close-ups of Amelia rushing towards the camera ( which recedes ahead of her in a travelling shot ) and close-ups of the back of a blonde woman's head as she rushes AWAY from the camera . I couldn't tell if this woman was meant to be Amelia seen from the rear , or whether this was another woman entirely ( possibly one of Michael's totties ) trying to flee from Amelia . In the event , it turned out that both intercuts were Amelia . I can't see any reason at all for shooting this sequence from both in front of and behind the same actress ; this gimmick added nothing to the film , and it created confusion that weakened the film's climax for me . Apart from that one odd decision , ' Amelia and Michael ' is extremely well made by all parties concerned ; the cast are excellent , the authentic locations are note-perfect throughout , and the background music by Nick Loe is effective without ever being intrusive . Portions of ' Amelia and Michael ' reminded me of various films by Ingmar Bergman , and I make the comparison as a compliment . My rating for this film : , and I look forward to more films by director Dan Cormack .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
331,"Text1: Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson paired up in a chick flick some 5 years back in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , with the latter making the former fall in love with her , and then having to shrug him off as part of a social experiment , only to find herself really loving him instead . In Fool's Gold , our couple reunites , with Kate Hudson's Tess going down deja-vu avenue in wanting to divorce husband Finn , played by McConaughey because she just had enough of his lack of keeping to promises , which even a fantastic sex life couldn't help . It's no surprise that movies such as Fool's Gold continue to be made , and the formula is pretty no brainer as well . Put in some tempting opportunity for prospecting sunken treasure in the depths of the seas from some aged old ship , smack together good looking leads ( so that they can get away with everything , including a bad story ) who don't mind bearing their bodies in trunks of bikinis for the most parts of the movie , and pour in plenty of water , jokes , and goon type characters as baddies . Finn , as a hero , is almost always bumming through life , and making the wrong deals with the wrong kinds of persons . His latest expedition , while managing to gain small results , offends his financier Bigg Bunny ( Kevin Hart ) , who's after his hide for making him lose money . His soon to be ex-wife works as a stewart onboard the luxury yacht of multi-millionaire Nigel Honeycutt ( Donald Sutherland ) , who soon finds himself charmed by the couple's enthusiasm and passion for treasure hunting , and backs them in their latest quest to locate the lost treasure known as the Queen's Dowry , where 40 chests of jewellery with emeralds and rubies the size of a human fists . And the quest is not made easy when there's competition in the form of Moe Fitch ( Ray Winstone without CGI to buff him up to Beowulf proportions ) , and Big Bunny's goons with an injection of foreign talent . For some parts , this looked like National Treasure without the location jet-setting and the cryptic clues . There's a hidden treasure somewhere that our heroes have to dig deep from clues provided from the past , in knowing characters , their histories and motivations , and of course with goons constantly hot on their heels doing things the easier way without working the brains . However , Fool's Gold had loaded itself with too many characters in its ensemble , and as it expectedly turns out , everyone else besides Hudson and McConaughey are in supporting , one dimensional caricatures . You have a rapper and his posse , a pair of gay chefs , rival treasure plunders with history going way back , and a tycoon and his daughter whom he's trying to connect with . If I should choose my favourite character amongst all of them , it's gotta be that bimbotic heiress ( Alexis Dziena ) probably cloned from Paris Hilton's genes . In fact , some of her lines are so genuinely stupid , that they somehow turn out really hilarious , and the delivery by that wide-eyed ingénue , clueless face , gave those lame jokes an added boost . Standard action adventure fare with predictable outcome . Don't go into this movie expecting anything more , or you'll be making a foolish choice .

Text2: I'll have to admit that Poltergay is a lot of fun , for straight folks and gay folks alike . It's probably something that Kelvin Tong's Men in White could have been - smart , witty and with that level of cheekiness , without almost always falling flat on its jokes . If it could have been at least what Poltergay was , then it won't have to suffer the misery of a relatively poor box office , or DVDs that I think most people would stand around the shops to watch for free , rather than to purchase a copy for personal consumption . The plot for Poltergay is a no brainer . Married couple Marc ( Clovis Cornillac ) and Emma ( Julie Depardieu ) move into an old dilapidated house at a bargain price . While slowly converting it to livable conditions , it turns out that Marc begins to hear things ( extremely loud music at 0155hrs each time ) , before suddenly realizing there're 5 queer men living in his cellar . However , it seems that he's the only one who can see these fellas , and before you know it , he's branded mad , and runs into martial troubles because , well , it's a gay themed movie , so naturally , everyone around thinks that Marc is a closet gay , secretly fantasizing about men , and 5 of them no less ! What I liked about the movie is how it incorporated the gay moments into the story and the jokes quite seamlessly , and introduced perhaps in an extremely novel way , the rationale behind ghost-spotting . It certainly took the mickey out of a lot of things , and brought out some laughter in subtle , razor sharp manner . However it is not without its flaws , as the introduction was a tad too draggy , and I thought took about an hour before the pace and the comedy picks up , and suddenly , there was a big squeeze of plenty of smaller subplots into the last 30 minutes , including the resolution and finale . Essentially it boiled down to screwing up , wrecking havoc , before the ghouls decided to help Marc get back to this normal life again . And the ghouls were pretty hilarious in themselves , with their penchant for tight clothing , and their disco dancing ways to Boney M's Rasputin for instance , injecting a certain amount of retro disco energy when they get down to boogeying the night away . Their individual characters could not be any different from one another , with for instance , a closet heterosexual ( oh ! ) , a gay couple , one nursing a broken heart , and one who likes to replicate his male manhood at almost every conceivable object he can get his hands on . It didn't have to rely on crude toilet humour , nor plenty of slapstick moments to bring on the laughs . What it had was a refreshing take on the horror-comedy genre , with a twist of the queer for good measure . Like I mentioned , it's enjoyable fluff , good enough for those stressed out workdays where you need some light hearted relief to keep your sanity .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Pretending to hold auditions for a new horror movie , he entices four young actors to his mansion but then challenges them to destroy him before the break of down . If they fail , he will kill them instead and then they too are doomed to live the boring life of vampires . Writer / director Lamberto Bava is infamous for his gross horror productions ( "" Demons "" , "" A Blade in the Dark "" ) but this merely is a harmless and light-headed quickie , meant for those who really want to see every Italian horror film ever made . There's almost no bloodshed or tension in the script and vampires look comical instead of scary . Still , I enjoyed watching "" Dinner with a Vampire "" because there's not one dull moment and it was great seeing George Hilton in a leading horror role again . Fans of Italian gialli-thrillers will definitely remember his face from classic titles such as "" The Case of the Bloody Iris "" , "" The Strange Vice of Mrs . Wardh "" and "" My Dear Killer "" . The sequences in the mansion's crypt and cellars are mildly atmospheric and the music is quite cheerful . Don't watch this film in case you're allergic to awful dubbing , though ? The English voices often are so dull they give you headaches .

Text2: I'm not a big fan of Paul Schrader , but I really dug this film ! Personally , I think ' Hardcore ' is Schrader's best film , as it successfully mixes effective social drama with compelling tension . George C . Scott is truly magnificent as the hardworking , Midwesterner Jake Van Dorn who individually searches for his lost preteen daughter . At first , he cooperates with a private-detective ( a very convincing Peter Boyle ) who discovers that his offspring is now active in the hardcore porn-industry . Later , Van Dorn forms a partnership with a poor whore who brings him into contact with the right persons in the business . The first hour of this film is really good and works on many levels . Not only does Schrader mixes different social mentalities and religious convictions , he also gives a perfect portrayal of how someone is driven to complete distraction . The sequences in which Van Dorn witnesses his own flesh and blood feature in a sexfilm are truly intense and vindictive . Of course , the pornography shown isn't real ( or even explicit ) but you can easily imagine what a father's reaction would be . And please keep in mind that the film is now 25 year old and the censorship has changed a lot since then . Unfortunately , Van Dorn's private investigations aren't always credible ( Scott dresses up as a stereotypical adult film-director and organises a cast-session ) and the ending is rather abrupt and unsatisfying . Nevertheless , ' Hardcore ' is a dreadfully overlooked film and one of the most efficient thrillers of the late seventies . George C . Scott is truly brilliant and I personally think this was his best period as an actor . A year later , he starred in the unforgettable horror-chiller ' The Changeling ' and gave away an equally brilliant performance . If you appreciate good thrillers , you have to give ' Hardcore ' a chance . Highly recommended .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The target of this movie is a very specific group of Brazilians that lives in big cities and is interested on this type of information ( like me ) . Foreigners , even those who live in Rio , São Paulo , Belo Horizonte , Porto Alegre or any other big and developed city in Brazil , will not catch , for example , the wrong Portuguese spoken by most of the interviewed or the funny accent from the country in the North of Brazil .

Imagine that one presented in the documentary , who play the Hymns of the City of Rio de Janeiro and Flamengo ( the most popular soccer team in Brazil ) and the Bolero of Ravel using a blade ? Since I was a kid I have not seen one of this knife sharpener any more . The movie also shows many persons originated from the circus ( the dog trainer , the gypsy , the ' repentistas ' - very funny singers originated from North of Brazil , the soccer player with one leg , the traffic light jugglers ) and working now on the streets . You can see also many persons that works on the street repairing small objects , like pans , chairs or umbrellas . Or the street vendors , selling oranges , cookies , herbs , or painting posters . In the periphery of big cities or in the interior and country of Brazil , you probably will find this type of professions , since the income of this population is very low . It may be difficult to a foreigner understand how , for example , a man that fix umbrellas can survive making about 50 cents per repaired umbrella , but do not forget that the minimum wage paid in Brazil is about eighty ( 80 ) US Dollars per month and a great part of the population receives less than that ridiculous amount .

I was happy to see that even though the plot here is a bit difficult to imagine actually happening , the film itself isn't so heavy-handed and schmaltzy as many of the day . In fact , the film is pretty low-key and the acting is a bit easier to believe than most - - with less wild gesticulating and over-acting than usual . The film is a very simple film about a family living in a Border state that is caught up in the war .

This is a frightening picture of the pornography business 20 years ago featuring about everything you can think of in that seedy world . Unfortunately , the story centers around finding a girl from a "" religious "" family and the father , played by George C . Scott , is painted as something of a fanatic . He's portrayed as a cold and violent figure . ( Hey , Hollywood isn't going to portray a Christian father as kind and loving . ) Yet , Scott is not all that bad because he still is extremely dedicated father who went to all lengths to get his daughter back . This movie really shows the sleazy side of the entire porno business and , thankfully , it doesn't glamorize any of it . Peter Boyle is good as the detective and Season Hubley is interesting as the prostitute who gives you her ideas on life in the business . This is a fascinating film in parts but also very tough to view in a number of areas . This may sound naive , but when I saw this in 1979 , I was stunned that this type of sick-underbelly of a society existed . . . . at least to this degree . I can't imagine what's out there today . In summary , a very powerful but brutal movie to watch , especially if you have kids of your own .

Text2: What an odd story . It was a good one for the first two-thirds of the film but the last third got so sick - at least to me and what little standards I possess , it lost favor with me . I got rid of it for that reason : overall - just too sick and too strange . It gets ugly because a 12-year-old kid , whom the story is centered around , starts to lose it . He tries to kill his uncle , begins using way too much profanity , and says and does things that no 12-year-old boy would say / do . The story just gets out of hand . Everyone in this film except the boy's mother is very odd with most of them winding up in a mental institution . I often laugh at dark humor but this is way too black , way too dark .

When Mike is attacked by something that drags him underneath his bed at a boarding house ran by a mysterious old lady ( Mary Nell Santacroce ) , Josh is left wondering where his brother has vanished to . The creepy lady tells him Mike wasn't in his room so Josh sets out to find him . The town has become derelict as Josh searches for his brother when he meets a school teacher , Holly ( beautiful Jody Medford ) tending to her sick uncle's tavern . They will soon become allies in a battle against zombies whose skin is a ghastly , ghostly white with yellow goo replacing red blood in their bodies . . if the zombies touch you , a steam becomes present and the acidic grasp kills . Alcoholic Sheriff Will Stewart ( Bo Hopkins ) , who is reeling from the accidental shooting of a child when he once a big city cop , is quite bewildered at what is happening to his town . He'll have to join forces , albeit reluctantly , with Josh to stop the carnage of the zombie outbreak . Can Will convince outstand law enforcement of the horror that has overwhelmed his little town ? Can the outbreak itself be silenced or is the threat to the entire country a possibility ? Average zombie flick doesn't have much originality . The closing final twenty minutes ratchets up the suspense as poor Josh and Holly become besieged by the monsters they once knew as regular people . There's a harrowing school sequence where Holly loses a young student she is trying to protect to the toxic little monsters as they invade a restroom . The film expects us to believe Josh & Holly could escape an army of those things as the screenplay allows them too much leeway , illogically , apart from them . Take a scene in an abandoned gas station where they are absolutely surrounded , yet the toxic monsters , a crap-load of them , don't simply attack when there's absolutely nowhere to run . Time and time again , the screenplay allows Josh to escape certain doom . The plot is just too unrealistic . And , how the zombies mutate ( from drinking toxic water ) after a lengthly illness seems rather far-fetched and silly . Jennifer Warren portrays Dr . Myra Tate who is a former squeeze of Will's and the town's female doctor whose assistant changes into a mutant attacking her .

Text2: A socially inert , icy detective , Keiko Kirishima ( Hitomi ) working on her first assignment , recently , by request , sent to the streets after working at a desk , finds the task of finding the mystery behind a rash of mysterious suicides quite demanding . It seems that those who commit suicide , in such a gruesome manner with whatever sharp object is available to them , are in a state of nightmarish sleep influenced by another to enact destruction upon themselves . Seeing that these aren't ordinary investigations , Keiko and partner Wakamiya ( Masanobu Ando ) are to find a psychic of some sort who can aid them in uncovering the predator who preys on victims with a suicidal desire to end their sad , seemingly unimportant lives in a crappy world . It seems that the dead victims , under suspicious means , communicated with someone merely identifying himself as O ( . . director Shinya Tsukamoto , in another one of his many strange supporting roles ) . O , it seems , somehow hypnotically controls those on the opposite end of the phone and Keiko decides that she'll need the help of an infamous "" nightmare detective "" ( Ryuhei Matsuda ) who can enter dreams to assist those under duress by whatever is plaguing the restless sleep of victims . Keiko will voluntarily call O in a desperate attempt to stop his murderous reign , facing the horrifying consequences as he exposes her own mental / emotional problems . Despite a reluctant resistance & fear , the nightmare detective will assist Keiko in trying to find and stop O . Part police procedural , part psychological thriller , with a little Nightmare on Elm Street mixed in , leave it to director Tsukamoto to make it all come together . Like the best psychological thrillers , we get an understanding as to why the killer is committing such evil deeds , and the frailties of those whose job it is to catch them . Through the killer , the emotionally fragile detective ( . . and our nightmare detective ) faces the inner demons that haunt her . In other words , through the ordeal of this killer invading her vulnerable dream state , she must find strength with the help of her telepathic avenger , the only one who can truly stop the madman , to face the knife-wielding hunk of monstrous flesh which briskly moves at it's victims . We also see through the eyes of our nightmare detective . . the inner thoughts of others which yield ugly revelations , the dream of a catatonic he's supposed to save , how he "" travels "" into the dreams of others , and how he indeed can alter the path of the killer ( . . first stopping it momentarily from attacking Wakamiya who calls O with tragic results , and how he assists Keiko whose seemingly trapped in an enclosed room with little wiggle-room to move ) with possible harm / death to himself . We also see what happens to several victims who communicate with O and the nightmarish plane for which he operates and the grisly , bloody results . And , indeed we get a showdown between the nightmare detective and the killer as we learn what may've formed them into the men they've become . My only real complaint was the camera work which is the newly adopted steady-cam style where everything's always moving frantically . AS with most of Tsukamoto's work , this could be a bit difficult and challenging for many viewers . I think the most present theme in the film is the will to live when life seems the most empty , and the terrain explored of why we are the way we are and the certain situations from the past that have shaped us into the human beings we have become . The three main leads , the emotionally vacant Keiko , the numb & sad nightmare detective tired of a gift which has been more of a burden , and the killer whose hunger for human flesh ( . . the monster that represents him in the nightmares that entreat upon victims , "" assisting "" them in an act they supposedly desired to commit ) derives from a desire to at first die by his own hand due to a horrifying traumatic experience as a child ( . . seeing this in a flashback when the nightmare detective "" opens "" his mind , which also answers the mysterious girl's voice asking for help ) leads to the deaths of many who were to kill themselves with him in a suicide pact across the phone .

According to the festival's programme , this print had "" missing titles "" . . . however , apart from an opening title and credits , I doubt that this movie ever had titles in the first place : the story is quite simple and doesn't need explanatory text . IMDb's synopsis is accurate . I wonder if this movie inspired Charley Chase's classic "" His Wooden Wedding "" , in which newlywed Chase is tricked into believing that his wife has a wooden leg . I'm giving a great deal of slack to the time period in which this movie was made , for a premise that is nowadays quite offensive : namely , that an amputee is unsuitable for marriage . I once had a mutually fulfilling relationship with a one-legged ( RAK ) lady who had no lack of male suitors . As I was watching the young and beautiful Florence Lawrence in this brief film , I couldn't help being reminded of her tragic suicide ( by a very painful method ) .

Well , you can actually see ' em both in one gloriously junky 90 minute sitting thanks to this crackerjack handy-dandy combo hybrid of the above-cited sub-genres . An enigmatic psycho biker dude whose face is obscured by a dark visor electrocutes a sizable volume of fun-loving , hooch-sodden , hormone-crazed hedonistic collegiate chowderheads partying their sun-tanned butts off during Easter vacation in Miami Beach , Florida . The murders totally baffle the local cops , who in time-honored B-pic tradition wish to keep the whole thing hush-hush so the resort town can still milk mucho money from the addle-pated twenty-something tourists . So , it's up to the token serious , self-disciplined nice college guy ( amiable Nicholas De Toth , who makes for a refreshingly earnest and unmacho reluctant protagonist ) and a sweet barmaid gal ( winningly played by the incredibly cute ultra-honey Sarah Buxton ) to find out who the true culprit is on their own . Done with the right amount of energy and competence to qualify as a perfectly acceptable and enjoyable serving of "" screw intelligence and just give me the lowdown trashy horror exploitation flick goods "" Saturday night schlock , this engagingly drecky beaut proves to be a whole lot of top-notch dopey fun . Director Umberto Lenzi , working from a slim , yet serviceable script by Larry Kirkpatrick ( who also wrote the equally dumb , but satisfying "" Primal Rage "" for Lenzi ) , keeps the proceedings lively and eventful by tossing in a rowdy gang of hog-ridin ' hellions called the Demons ( ! ) , a bunch of thrashing ' heavy metal tunes roaring ' away on the soundtrack ( the theme song "" Don't Break My Heart "" by Kristen really smokes ) , a few wet t-shirt contests , several grisly murder set pieces ( Alessandro Rambaldi did the great , gruesome gore f / x ) , a throbbing ' rock score by Goblin's Claidio Simonetti , crude condom gags , plenty of attractive babes in skimpy bikinis , a "" Jaws "" - style "" let's keep this homicide stuff quiet ' cause it's bad for business "" cover-up conspiracy sub-plot , more idiotic horny toad college revelers than you can shake an empty beer can at , and even a little gratuitous female nudity .

Text2: Psychedelic soft-erotic exploitation movies were an inexplicably popular trend amongst European directors back in the late 60's and early 70's . This generally pointless sub genre of horror consists of movies that basically don't have any plots , but are stuffed with trendy looking women parading around naked and fetishist escapades that all healthy heterosexual males are supposed to fantasize about . Yeah , right ? I don't know about you , but I surely never dreamed of sadomasochistic rubber dolls or Nazi elimination squads . The list of these oddball movies is long and contains efforts from several acclaimed directors , like Mario Bava's "" Lisa and the Devil "" , Jess Franco's "" Succubus "" , Massimo Dallamano's "" Venus in Furs "" , Umberto Lenzi's "" Orgasmo "" and Piero Schivazappa's "" The Laughing Woman "" . "" Baba Yaga "" also fits into this category , but here the script was inspired by an eccentric comic books series courtesy of Guido Crepax . Basically this means that "" Baby Yaga "" is even weirder and more flamboyant than all the other psychedelic sex flicks mentioned here above . During a live and personal presentation of his film , at a festival in my home country Belgium , director Corrando Farina explained that he tried to translate as many comic book elements to the screen as possible , but that it certainly wasn't easy due to budgetary restriction and uncooperative producers and censorship . Still , no matter what Farina claims , nothing can divert the attention away from the fact that "" Baba Yaga "" is a dull and utterly incoherent movie . I didn't spot any artistic style elements at all and the hallucinogenic footage is just a bunch of randomly scraped together and irrelevant sleaze . Isabelle De Funès ( Louis ' yummy niece , apparently ) stars as a liberated photographer in Milan . Late one night and following only a brief encounter , she reluctantly becomes the object of obsession of the funnily named lesbian witch Baba Yaga ( Carroll Baker ) . The deranged hag turns Valentina's camera into a murder device , transfigures her best friend into an SM-doll , inflicts eerie nightmares on her and eventually lures the poor girl to an abandoned mansion with nasty sewing machines and bottomless pits . In case you're looking for significance , symbolism or possibly even an explanation , I'm afraid I have to discourage you straight away . Everything that happens in "" Baba Yaga "" happens for absolutely NO reason and the film finishes just as void as it begun . To round up with at least a couple of positive remarks , I really liked the music and both Isabella De Funès and Ely Galleani are stunningly beautiful ladies to look at .

Text2: When I first saw YOUNG FRAKENSTIEN 20 years ago I rolled around the living room in fits of hysterical laughter , something that hasn't happened very often . In fact I would probably that throughout my life this has just got to be the funniest film I have ever seen in my life so when it was broadcast on BBC 2 over the Christmas period I went out of my way to watch it Hmmm . I have to amend my opinion chaps . Not only is it no longer the funniest film I have seen in my entire life I wouldn't even consider it the funniest film from Mel Brooks ( Which will remain now and forever BLAZING SADDLES ) which is a great shame . The problem is that much of the early part of the story seems to drag along with a fairly unfunny broad performance by Gene Wilder and he's not helped by Marty Feldman as Igor , though perhaps the screenplay is to blame since both characters have a running gag of getting their names wrong - "" Fronkonsteen "" and "" Eyegore "" . Some of the other failings might be down to the fact that my views of the original Universal horror movies that YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN parody have changed over the years . When I was a teenager I used to love these movies had very fond memories but after seeing them all again over the years I found them lacking and were nowhere as good as I remembered them That said where this film is at its funniest is when they directly spoof scenes from the original movie . The scenes with Inspector Kemp , especially when he is first introduced still make laugh as does the scenes culled from THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN featuring Gene Hackman .

345,"Text1: I don't usually bother with ' epics ' and I'm especially averse to CGI but what the hell , it's Christmas , a time of year when my arm is susceptible to a gentle twist or two so off I went and found I was watching three films in one ; an hour of Depression-era New York plus voyage , a little over an hour on Skull Island and a little less than an hour back in New York . First the positives ; Jackson obviously knows how to make a little go a long way and extract multiple mileage out of a simple idea , ergo , we open on a montage of Hoovervilles , soup-kitchens etc as Al Jolson bellows ' I'm Sitting On Top Of The World ' which is not only irony but anticipates the finale with Kong atop the Empire State building and bellowing not quite so loud as super-ham Jolie . The opening is all about desperation , from the starving jobless in general to Ann Darrow ( Naomi Watts ) and her actor friends specifically and then the desperation of those like Carl Denham ( Jack Black ) and his crew who DO have jobs but are about to lose them , which segues nicely into Denham's desperation to 1 ) flee the country one jump ahead of the moguls he has conned , 2 ) find a replacement leading lady at a minute's notice , 3 ) convince the captain ( Thomas Kretschman to weigh anchor like NOW , Man and 4 ) con writer Jack Driscoll ( Adrien Brody ) into remaining on board til the ship is underway . Black's interior sweating recalls Oscar Muldoon ( a great performance by Edmond O'Brien ) in The Barefoot Contessa and there's a nice touch in the poster that Bruce Baxter ( Kyle Chandler ) , a rugged Rock Hudson type sticks on his cabin wall heralding his appearance in Rough Trader and when Baxter is seen fleeing in terror on Skull Island insiders will recognise the reference to Richard Barthelmess an actor who made his name in aviation movies whilst being terrified to fly . Watts is fully believable as the naive trouper - a contradiction in terms if ever there was one - who instinctively runs towards Kong for protection from the T-Rex or whatever . The ludicrous note is that despite several close encounters with rough terrain and even rougher predators she manages to keep her clothes intact which defies logic especially in 2005 when no one is going to object to a little non-sexual nudity . On the negative side the natives disappear without trace once they have served their purpose of capturing Ann as a sacrificial offering and all of a sudden Jackson , who has been content to give us a blow-by-blow up to now , cuts from the chloroformed Kong to several months later when he's the main attraction on Mazda Lane . Clearly it would have been embarrassing to attempt to show Kong being transported in a ship his weight alone would probably sink to say nothing of there being no suitable restraints on board - perhaps foolishly Jackson allows Denham to draw attention to the size and strength of the restraints attached to Kong in the theatre , restraints which he had little trouble throwing off so how did they get him back ? Best not to ask , suspend your disbelief and enjoy .

Text2: Gordon Douglas was something of a poor man's Michael Curtiz at Warner Brothers inasmuch as he could turn his hand to just about any genre the studio assigned him to . In the early fifties Alan Ladd had run out of exotic locations to meet Veronica Lake and William Bendix at Paramount and although his greatest performance and greatest Paramount film by far ( Shane ) was already in the can though unreleased his agent wife Sue Carroll brokered a deal that took him to Warners who , being hip to his stand-out performance in Shane , laid on another ' Western ' to welcome him aboard . As a biography of Jim Bowie it fits where it touches and concludes with no reference to the Alamo - probably a bit tricky as Bowie winds up the movie married to the daughter of a Mexican official . That aside it's a fine example of the genre with Ladd on top of his game albeit playing Bowie as a nice guy who can't seem to help killing people , mostly as a result of his involvement with super-bitch socialite Virginia Mayo . In terms of Ladd's overall career it ranks well inside the top half and will surely entertain viewers .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The story of Network still reigns true today with networks . Everybody wants high ratings and it becomes a brutal , tortured world . Peter Finch's Oscar winning role will be his most famous and one of the last . He died before getting his Academy Award . Faye Dunaway is one of the most talented actresses around and I hear she can be a bit difficult but this role is really a good role but not one of my favorites of hers . I liked her better in Bonnie and Clyde , Chinatown , and later as Joan Crawford in Mommy Dearest . I believe the Oscar was overdue .

Text2: Years before The Coen Brothers unleashed their trademark eccentric characters and even before Woody Allen got on the scene with his endless talkies , Blake Edwards gave us this subtle but weird comedy that seems to be overlooked by most audiences desensitised by films like Mud in Manhattan , Hitch and the latest Bridget Jones crap . What most of these films lack is a strong sense of character and involvement in their world . You really do feel drawn into the relationship between Holly Golightly ( Audrey Hepburn ) , a teenage runaway who ended up a high-class escort in New York and Paul ' Fred ' Varjak ( a youthful George Peppard ) a writer / gigolo who has had nothing to inspire him of late until Holly came into his life . The only time caricature comes into the film is Mickey Rooney's Japanese landlord ( and he's not Japanese ) , but he hardly features that much for it to be annoying . The film has a lot in common with There's Something About Mary , which I am sure owes most of its ideas to . Almost every man who meets Holly falls head over heels in love with her but it takes someone just like her for Holly to love back . Both Holly and Paul are struggling to make their own way in the city . Both have to sell themselves to the opposite sex in order to make ends meet . While Paul just wants to be a successful writer , Holly is desperate to marry a rich millionaire to snag some of the fortune for herself and take care of her brother once he leaves the army . Her escort girl lifestyle is taking its toll on her so much that 6am is only the end of the night for her and not morning . As a result she eats a fast food breakfast on a deserted street while longingly window-shopping at Tiffany's , a shop she'll probably never afford to buy from . However you just know that , despite not having much money , Holly and Paul will take good care of each other by the end of the movie . What gives this film a unique charm on top of the performances are the many oddball moments and quirky touches . Most of them supplied by Holly's cat , known simply as Cat . And Henry Mancini's score ( before he and Blake Edwards teamed up for the famous Pink Panther ) seems right out of a Broadway musical and plays a strong part in making the movie what it is . There's no generic piano cues or pop songs here . I haven't read the book so I cannot compare like so many other people here have , but the film certainly does stand up on it's own . No film sticks entirely to the books they are based on anyway .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The graphics , level design and gameplay make for a truly great playing experience . I never did finish the first Super Mario Bros . ( as of yet ) and I've never even played Super Mario Bros . 2 but now , after liking this so much , I will seriously have to consider it . In terms of originality you won't find anything particularly amazing about the jumping of one platform to the next and collecting power-ups but it's how it all comes together and works so well that makes SMB3 stand out from the rest of the competition . Some levels are tough , but stick at them and you'll memorise and master the tricky bits pretty quickly . However , that didn't stop me from crying out loud in sheer , hopeless frustration every now and again . The GBA version adds a save function ( a godsend for those who hate having to spend 86 hours finishing a game in one go ) , slightly tweaked levels and compatibility with the Nintendo E-Reader that offers bonus levels . Considering how good this game is it's no wonder Sonic had such tough competition from a short , fat Italian plumber . Definitely one to hunt down .

Text2: Very good thriller , in spite of Gwyneth Paltrow's involvement . I generally detest Gwyneth Paltrow in everything she's done . I can't abide her presence and it is my personal opinion that she suffers from a total lack of talent . However , Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt pull this one completely out of the wastebasket , dusts it off , and sets it back on the shelf . The story is very telling , the performances are completely professional , the set designs are inspired , and the whole production is darkly and eerily executed . You can , however , see Mr . Pitt's character from 12 Monkeys in his character in this movie , as they were filmed very close to one another . You can see some of the schizophrenic mannerisms exhibited here , which in no way draws from the character , nor does it draw from the finished product . I found it rather endearing , in fact , as I enjoyed 12 Monkeys very much . Freeman and Pitt work together quite well , after a slow and faltering acceptance of one another , to lead you down the road which takes you into the dark and noisome mind of a killer . All in all , not a bad movie . I'm very grateful that Ms . Paltrow's part was small and almost inconsequential . I've just one question , though . What is with the fascination with Christian legend , of late ? There are thousands of ancient civilizations out there which worshiped thousands of gods / goddesses .

351,"Text1: There are two types of bad films : bad films that are fun and somehow end up being good , and bad films that are no fun and only manage to be crap . Given the plot line , this bad film really should have belonged to the former group ; but somehow it doesn't manage it and ends up being a part of the latter . Quite how a film about ravenous , over-sized animals could be so boring escapes me , but somehow director Bert I . Gordon has managed to make it so . The film is based on a story by the great H . G . Wells , and while I haven't read it , I think it's safe to say that The Food of the Gods is a lot better on paper than it is on screen ! The plot focuses on a group of friends who go hunting on a Canadian island . It's not long before they are attacked by a group of wasps , but they're not just any wasps - they're giant aggressive wasps ! One of their number is killed by the wasps , so the friends go looking for help , when they come upon a barn inhabited by giant chickens ! It's not long before they put two and two together and realise that something funny is going on - shortly before they meet the most dangerous creature on the island , the rats . . . Giant animal films don't tend to be high quality , and this one does nothing to buck that trend . Most of the action is unexciting , and when you've got people battling giant animals - that really shouldn't be the case ! The special effects are decent in places , the rat attack looks decent enough considering that this is a very low quality film , but some of the effects look terrible and the gore isn't any good either . The plot is fairly basic and there isn't much explanation for anything , which is a shame as the story basically just lays out it's stall ( a load of white goo trickling down the side of the mountain ) and lets the giant creatures take it from there ; but the giants aren't enough to keep things entertaining , and the film fails for that reason . It becomes hard to care about anything shortly after the film starts , and that doesn't get any better as it moves on . Probably quite unsurprisingly , I wasn't impressed at all with The Food of the Gods , and that's a shame as this could have been quite decent if it had been handled better . I can't really recommend wasting time with this film - shiny new DVD release or not !

Text2: After hearing the numerous critical accolades heaped on this film , I thought there was no way it could live up to its hype . I was wrong . What a sensational , beautiful movie . Julian Schnabel , whose past efforts have left me cold , tells this amazing story with a nearly perfect directorial approach . It's about Jean-Dominique Bauby , former editor of Elle magazine , who suffered a rare kind of stroke that left him completely paralyzed from head to toe , but with his mental faculties completely intact . He learns to communicate by blinking an eyelid , and with the help of a translator , wrote the memoir on which this film is based one letter at a time . I haven't seen a movie this year that more perfectly matches visual style to subject matter . The first half an hour or so of the film is told strictly through Bauby's point of view - - the world appears as a series of blurry , fragmented images . This style nearly sent me out of my skin with claustrophobia , and while it can't come near to recreating what Bauby himself must have suffered , it's effective enough . But then the movie opens up as Bauby's world begins to expand , and the film becomes as much about the remarkable people around him who supported him in his recovery as it is about Bauby himself . Once Bauby's perceptions of the world become limited to what he can hear and what he can see through one eye , he realizes that he's lived his life somewhat deaf and dumb to the world around him , and so - - as the film implies - - do we all . But the film isn't preachy or over sentimental . It didn't really even have anything to say that I haven't heard before , yet it took such an original approach to the material that it all felt brand new . Mathieu Amalric delivers a marvelous performance as Bauby , and Max von Sydow will break your heart in two brief but devastating scenes as Bauby's dad .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The host of their macabre possible futures is Dr .

Charles allows the burden of such a troubled genius because of his intellect and amusing banter when it doesn't sink it's fangs too deep .

When he takes on an understudy , Lizzy ( Samantha Morton , a bit too theatrical ) to show her the proper way to exude her true talents in her performances on stage , Earl falls madly in love with her . It awakens something within , a passion for life that isn't there when he is home with his gorgeous wife , Elizabeth ( Rosamund Pike ) . When he pulls one prank too many ( a hilariously perverse play for a French man of great importance that Charles wishes to impress for money his country has a lack of consisting of dildo's and the Earl himself dressed to the nines exactly as his King in a form of mockery ) his life descends into disease and poverty . His body ravaged with pox and his face overwhelmed with horrible diseased scarring . . his nose needs a silver covering while he can barely walk , hobbling everywhere he goes . He would lie dead , a shell of what he once was , at age 33 . The film doesn't judge John Wilmot , but certainly shows who he was and the film is frank in dialogue how he spoke . He followed the wants of the flesh despite the feelings of his God-fearing mother or his dutiful wife who took and took without anything given back to her . Wilmot was kept by Charles because of his abilities , but even those become futile as he slowly washes out reality with the alcohol he consumes . Though , the film is fascinating to me because of Johnny Depp's performance . Depp is enigmatic and Rochester . . he held my interest the entire time . The film is directed by a hand-held which may drive purists batty who are used to period pieces being lensed in a slick pattern . The director here seems to what to bring an ugliness and poverty-stricken feel to Charles ' land at this point and time . . by having the camera move , even at times where the camera seems to be held by some amateur using his camcorder taping live events from the 1800's , we feel like we're actually nearby watching Rochester ruin his life as a voyeur . I always felt that is why directors of today like to binge on the hand-helds . They want to bring a personal feel to the viewer as if we are placed right within the action of that moment . I liked the use of this device in this film , not to mention the "" dirty "" cinematography so many critics fussed about . I like that the film shows the period as ugly and deformed as Rochester becomes .

353,"Text1: I don't understand all the praise . Sure , it's a pretty good movie , but it's flat , obvious , and not at all memorable . Eastwood's last film , Mystic River , was ten times better . Hilary Swank plays a boxer who persists in trying to get trainer Clint Eastwood to make her his student . He finally does accept her , especially after his friend , Morgan Freeman , who works as a janitor in his gym , convinces him of her talent . Most of the movie is a pretty straightforward boxing drama . Swank and Eastwood become each other's surrogate father and daughter , both making up for lost loved ones ( Swank's father is dead , and Eastwood's daughter refuses to talk to him ) . The final act adds a tearjerker . There is also a poorly developed subplot about a few of the regulars at Eastwood's gym . It's slow , but mostly entertaining . Swank is good , but nowhere near the level that she hit with Boys Don't Cry . It's impossible to believe that Eastwood got nominated , especially over Paul Giamatti for Sideways . His direction is fine , but he can barely speak . Plus , he's so old it looks like his skeleton is trying to escape from his body . Morgan Freeman isn't especially great in his supporting role . He can't speak clearly , either . He narrates the film , and it can often be very hard to understand him . Million Dollar Baby is worth seeing , but it certainly isn't award-worthy . .

It was in the battle of the Argonne Forest that the US Expeditionary Force suffered its greatest losses in all of WWI : 130 , 000 casualties with some 27 , 000 killed or missing . The film centers around the beloved Chaplin of the Fighting 69th Father Francis J . Duffy , Pat O'Brien , and the arrogant and at the same time yellow-bellied Pvt . Jerry Plunkett , James Cagney , who despite his quick with his fists reputation was totally gutless when it came to put up or shut up under enemy fire . Plunkett earned the disrespect of everyone in his unit with his big mouth about he'll come home after the war with a chest full of battle ribbons and combat medals . It was when Plunkett and the men of the Fighting 69th came under fire by the Germans that he froze and tired to wimp himself out of fighting by putting on a act , which wasn't that hard for him to do , of cowardice that in fact cost the lives of over a dozen of his comrades . It was Father Duffy's faith in Pluckett's ability in being a soldier that kept him from being transfered out of the unit for good as well as , which Pluckett always wanted , far behind the battle-lines . Despite Plunkett's miserable record as a combat soldier Father Duffy got his commanding officer Major "" Wild Bill "" Donovan , George Brant , to give Plunkett another chance only to have him screw up again costing the lives of another half dozen of his men . Court-martial-led and sentenced to be shot at sunrise Plunkett is given a second , or is it his third or forth , chance to redeem himself when the Germans open up on the American forces with a deadly artillery and mortar barrage . This gives Plunkett the chance to escape and make his way back home , to Brooklyn New York , during all the confusion . Making it to the local church Plunkett sees Father Duffy conducting services for the man of the Fighting 69th there and something clicks in the terribly confused Pvt . Plunkett's head . It's then with the encouragement of Father Duffy that Plunkett turns over a new leaf and heads straight to the front lines not to show how brave he is but to make up far all the damage he caused in his cowedly actions up until then . With the help of his former combat company sergeant "" Big Mike "" Wynn , Alan Hale , Plunkett holds off a determined German offensive blasting a hole through the Germans lines and at the same time saving Sgt . Wynn's , who up until then had no use for Plunkett at all , life ! Excellent men of war type of movie that shows that bravery and cowardice are motivated by one and same emotion : Fear . Pvt . Plunkett's bravado back in Brooklyn was short-circuited in the battle fields in France in that the worst that could happen to him back there , Brooklyn , was a bloody nose or a black eye . In France Plunkett not only was risking his life but the lives of his fellow soldiers in whatever , good or bad , actions he took . It took a lot of soul searching on Plunkett's part as well as Father Duffy's faith in him that brought Plunkett around and made a soldier as well as hero out of him . Something that Pvt . Plunkett never thought that he had in him until that one brief fleeting , as well as magical , moment in church that turned his entire life around .

In My opinion its just as great as the Fellowship but TTT is a much darker and violent film than the first part and has about same amount of humor . Viggo Mortensen was excellent and I really like his character . In the FOTR he showed a lot but in TTT he shows even more ! Liv Tyler was great and she looked so good . The new characters such as Eomer , Faramir were very likable . Brad Dourif was awesome as Grima Wormtongue ! Cate Blanchett really wasn't in TTT very long but she was very good . Another top notch performence ! Christopher Lee was great and the others like Orlando Bloom as Legolas and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli was good like before . Ian McKellan was good as Gandalf but since he is Gandalf the White his character seemed different than he was in first part of The Lord of the Rings . Bernard Hill as King Theodon was good as well . As for the other stuff I was really fascinated by Treebeard and the Ents . I honestly thought that they would be to cartoony and wouldn't fit in the film but they were great . The Gollum CGI character was good and very realistic . I loved the giant elephants and the Wargs . I couldn't believe it when I saw the Ringwraiths riding dragons and the Cave Trolls are great . As for the film itself its a wonderful film . The scenery , the battles , every thing was great ! The prolog was great with Gandalf and the Balrog . The Battle at Helms Deep was very epic and the three battle scenes at different places didn't hurt . Is all I can say is that TTT is a great film and its one of the best ever .

357,"Text1: The last entry in Hammer's legendary Frankenstein cycle by far isn't the best one , but it probably is the most appealing chapter to enthusiast horror buffs due to the excessive use of blood and ugly make-up effects . "" Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell "" is the direct successor of "" Frankenstein must be destroyed "" , since Jimmy Sangster's "" Horror of Frankenstein "" introduced a different lead-actor ( Ralph Bates ) and repeated the initial premise of the infamous baron . Terence Fisher's grand finale is set entirely in a mental asylum where good old Peter Cushing continues his deviant experiments undercover . He changed his name to Dr . Viktor and receives help from a gifted new-arrival who got convicted for committing the exact same sorcery-crimes ( although Frankenstein considers it science ) . In their private asylum-chambers , the doctors create new life using the brains and body parts of unfortunate patients of the asylum . Although good campy fun nonetheless , this film slightly disappoints compared to its predecessors . I feel like Fisher could have used the grim asylum setting much better and even Cushing's characters isn't as ' evil ' as it was in the other films . Simon Helder ? Frankenstein's partner in crime ? is entirely listless and Madeline Smith doesn't do much either , aside from looking really cute . The monster doesn't evoke feelings of fright and he actually looks more like a fugitive cast-member of the "" Planet of the Apes "" - series . On the other hand , you could say that this installment is one of the better since the scenery is raw and the monster is more repellent looking . There are some really nasty killings in this film and the medical experiments are extremely graphic ( a gratuitous brain-transplant , anyone ? ) . Purely talking trivia , this also is an interesting film as it was Terence Fisher's last directing achievement . This great director easily was one of the genre's most important icons , with on his repertoire most films of both the Frankenstein and Dracula franchises as well as some other milestones like "" The Devil Rides Out "" and "" The Mummy "" . His last film ( Fisher passed away in 1980 ) is great entertainment and nothing more .

Text2: Horror and Westerns generally don't form a great cinematic match , but Fernando Mendez ' "" The Living Coffin "" has a fairly good story and contains a handful of admirable ideas . The plot combines typical western bar fights and heroic cowboy characters with favorite Gothic horror subjects like the legend of the crying woman ( processed much better in another contemporary Mexican feature entitled "" The Curse of the Crying Woman ) , premature burial and local superstition . In a small town near a sinister swamp , the restless spirit of the "" crying woman "" supposedly haunts the remote mansion of an eminent family . She passed away nearly a year ago , but her cries in agony over the loss of her two children can often be heard in the swamp , and her remaining relatives ( a sister and an attractive young niece ) fear supernatural acts of vengeance . A knife in a clock protects the house , but when it gets removed the ghost emerges from the coffin . Luckily enough , the courageous cowboy Gaston and his unusually intelligent horse travel through the area , and they'll figure out whether there really are ghosts or just a fiendish conspiracy to steal the family's fortune . The sequences in the swamp as well as inside the mansion's catacombs are surprisingly atmospheric and there's a fair share of morbid scenery , like the tomb and crying lady's make-up . Unfortunately , however , there are approximately as many negative elements as there are positive ones , including the cowboy's totally redundant sidekick , whose job is provide an unnecessary comic relief as he always falls asleep and frequently gets hit on the head , and the utterly implausible capacities of Gaston's horse . The animal is actually the real hero here , because he saves his owner's life on several occasions , randomly discovers secret passageways and even defeats the enemies in a totally laughable finale .

It's a mystery whose central mystery , once revealed , isn't all that mysterious , yet the film manages to build an exciting amount of suspense anyway . It's success , I think , lies in the fact that it builds a great deal of character development and character-driven subplots into the film , so that not everything hinges on how tricky you find the ending to be . As Paul Giamatti's police inspector character begins to connect the pieces of the puzzle in the film's climactic moments , it's more fun to watch his face responding to the trick than it is to see how the trick was pulled off in the first place . Edward Norton , as usual , does a fine job as master magician Eisenheim , who meets his long-lost childhood love ( Jessica Biel ) ten years after they were parted and told they could never be together , due to class differences . From there , it's up to Eisenheim to pull off his most elaborate illusion yet , and make them "" disappear , "" as his young love asks him to do early in the film .

Strangely enough , I thought it got much less interesting when it moved to the titular island , Dry Tortuga in the Florida Keys . I don't exactly know why , but I lost interest during the latter half of the movie , despite the wonderful presence of John Carradine at his hammiest . Love that guy . The bug-eyed Negro characters are pretty annoying in this one , although I thought the character of Buck , a former slave of Mudd's who aids him in prison , was one of the more positive characters of that type I've seen . Not that the depiction isn't fairly racist , but at least he's kind of a hero .

Text2: SPOILERS Futuristic drama set in 2020 Great Britian about a totalitarian government being confronted by a dark clothed freedom fighter determined to bring it down that it ends up costing him his life . Making himself know to the British people on midnight November 5 , V , Hugo Weaving , first rescues young British national TV employee Evey , Natalie Portman , from two government security men who are about to have her arrested for being outside on the street after curfew . V takes Evey with him on a rooftop as the Old Baily building in London is blown to pieces by explosives that he planted there to the music of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture . That results in the British dictator Chancellor Adam Sutler , John Hurt , having a fit ordering his entire army of security , as well as the British military , to find who ever did it and then bring him to justice ; Which is a a trial conducted by the state without a jury . The next day V breaks into the government controlled TV studio in London and after dispatching a squad of security men goes on the air telling the Britsh people that he'll be at war with Sutler's regime with the final reckoning coming next November 5 "" Guy Fawkes Day "" . It's then when he'll destroy the British Parliament building that Fawkes attempted , but failed , to do back in 1605 . The movie "" V for Vendetta "" mirrors what's happening now in the world with terrorism the weapon of choice by the likes of Osama Bin-Ladin & Co . and has V using these same hit-and-run tactics against the British Government that he feels has betrayed and enslaved the British people . Enormously successful in his battle against the Sutler regime V nevertheless is a one man army with no one , but Evey , joining him in his fight . Which makes him a bit more then just a human being but someone with superhuman powers who can take on dozens of opponents and defeat them without as much as breaking into a sweat . We get to know V's background in a number of flashbacks that indicate that he was the subject of a government experiment that went wrong that left him scared for life . wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and Zorro-like hat V strikes us as someone out of the 18th not 21th century . We also get some idea of how a totalitarian regime like Adam Sutler's took over the government with flashbacks about a deadly biological attack on Britian that resulted in over 100 , 000 deaths . Were also given the impression that it was the Sutler Regime itself that engineered that attack , making it look like it was the work of Islamic terrorists , in order to get the British people through their representatives in the Parliament to give up their rights and make Sutler a total dictator who answers to no one and to no laws . As November 5 gets closer by the day It's not V but Chancellor Sutler and his underlings who start to panic as the mysterious masked maestro knocks off key members of his regime including the "" Voice of London "" Lewis Profhero , Roger Allen , who we later find out was the commandant of a brutal government concentration camp where V was later almost killed in a chemical explosion . Using the London tube , or subway , V has a plan to use a train-load of explosives that will go under the Parliament building at precisely midnight November 5 and blow the place straight to hell but Sutler won't be there . He's deposed by his handlers lead by the secretive behind the scenes Cheedy , Tim Pigoff-Smith , who together with his henchmen ends up confronting V in a battle that the result will be the future course of Britsh , as well as American , history . Thought-provoking film with a really surprise ending , that takes up the movies last fifteen or so minutes , that has you thinking about that famous saying about Freedom & Equality ; "" Freedom is not Free and Free men are not Equal "" . That so perfectly describes the movies sheep-like and ignorant British people in the quotes beginning statement and the courageous and principled masked avenger and freedom fighter V for Vendetta in the quotes end .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

362,"Text1: Arlington Road has the rare quality of being a thriller with no slow moments at all . Even the thorough character development does not take time away from the mind-blowing action that flows seamlessly from beginning to end . The opening scene , in which Michael Faraday ( Jeff Bridges ) comes upon a bleeding boy in the middle of Arlington Road and takes him to a nearby hospital is a brilliantly thought out piece of character development ( in regards to the rest of that boy's family ) that is not realized until a little bit later in the film , but once it is realized , it is incredible . Tim Robbins delivers one of the most satisfactory performances of his career as Oliver Lang , in a sharp but flawlessly executed turn from his recent efforts in such films as Nothing To Lose and the great Shawshank Redemption . When Lang moves into a new house , he becomes the neighbor of Michael Faraday ( Bridges ) , and they strike up a good friendship , seeming to be perfect neighbors . However , Faraday begins to notice suspicious things in Lang's house , and soon suspects that he is a terrorist . As a professor of a terrorism course himself , Faraday is clearly very determined to get to the bottom of his suspicions , especially since he lost his wife in a botched FBI excursion . Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack , as his wife , are so convincing as the lovable but questionable couple across the street that they almost attain spiv status . Although this film is recent , and noir is virtually extinct , it is almost like a film noir because of the likeable characteristics of the villains . There is also wonderful camera work that is worthy of being noted specifically . One scene that comes to mind is the scene in which Lang confronts Faraday in his backyard . The way that that scene was photographed makes such clever use of the angles and the surrounding setting that the camera work is able to tell a bit of the story by itself . This is something that is extremely useful in films , and modern films rarely take advantage of these possibilities . Arlington Road never lets up . You don't get a break throughout the entire film , and the jaw-dropping ending is comparable to the stunning and original endings of other films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club . You're not going to walk away from this film feeling all warm and fuzzy inside , you may actually feel discomfort , but you won't feel CHEATED . That's important , because they could easily have slapped on a cute little Hollywood ending and thus lost the film in the endless cavern of run-of-the-mill thrillers , but instead they ended the film in an attention-getting and completely unpredictable way . Excellent show .

Text2: SPOILER ALERT First of all , I would like to point out that I am a huge fan of Roger Ebert . His reviews are well written and enlightening about the movies that they focus on and often a lot of obscure movies that are related to the one in question , but his review of Memento is one of the most ignorant and just flat-out incorrect pieces of film criticism that I have ever read . Sure , there's a hole in the plot . If the last thing that Leonard remembers is his wife dying , then he should not technically remember that he can't form short term memories . Plot hole , yes . But who cares ? ! Anyone ? Anyone ? Me neither . Plot holes plague the Back to the Future series , one of the most entertaining trilogies ever made , left and right . In Part II , Marty McFly leaves 1985 to travel to the year 2015 to prevent his teenage son from robbing a bank and getting thrown in jail and starting that horrible chain reaction that destroys his entire family . In his review of that film , Ebert seems to have overlooked the MASSIVE plot hole that far overshadows the one that he points out in Memento ? if Marty leaves 1985 and travels to 2015 , there is no longer any Marty left in 1985 to grow into the 47-year-old Marty that he finds in 2015 . This little revelation suggests that Ebert is either judging films on varying and unstable criteria , or he has something against someone involved in the making of Memento . Regardless of what Ebert says , Memento is an absolutely brilliant film that engages the viewer and literally brings him or her into the mind of the main character . Ebert naively points out that the reverse plotline of the film has nothing to do with Leonard's condition , which is arguably the most foolish thing that he says in his review . Ebert has made what may be called the idiotic assumption that the reverse plotline represents the way that Leonard lives . I am finding it difficult to determine how he has managed to come to that conclusion without inserting plotlines of his own into the film , such as ones involving time travel or some other such science fiction nonsense . Memento is a dramatic thriller about a man with a severe psychological memory disorder , and the reverse plotline is there to put the audience in Leonard's shoes . He has no idea what happened before what he's doing right now , and neither do we . Are you hearing this , Roger ? I suggest you watch this movie again , because you missed a LOT . ( spoilers ) Another gigantic element of the plot that Ebert seems to have missed ( BOTH times he saw the film ) , is the fact that Leonard's wife was never raped , and never killed . There is a single shot near the end of the film ( I warn again , there are spoilers ahead ! ) that is not more than a few seconds long , that proves that she was never killed ( I suppose rape is still a possibility ) , and also eradicates the plot hole that Ebert pointed out , that Leonard should not be able to remember his ' condition ' if the last thing that he remembers is his wife being killed . The shot that I am talking about is one in which Leonard is laying in bed , and his wife is laying next to him with her head on his shoulder , running her fingers over the tattoo across his chest that says ' John G . raped and murdered my wife . ' Are you hearing THIS , Roger ? One viewing , contrary to what Ebert foolishly suggested in his review , is NOT enough for this film . Memento is one of the few films that not only invites repeat viewings , but requires them . Confusion is not the state to be in here , not by any stretch of the imagination . Repeat viewings will remove you from that state and put you in a state of blissful enlightenment as you realize the astonishing intricacy of this film . The poignant back story about Sammy Jankis and his wife is not only powerful and moving , but relates DIRECTLY to Loenard's condition , which is yet another thing that Ebert has amazingly managed to completely miss . In Ebert's defense ( because I do not intend this review of my own to be a knock against one of my otherwise favorite film critics ) , I can only say that maybe he latched onto some erroneous idea the first time he saw the film that clouded his cinematic vision the second time he saw it , or perhaps he was simply viewing it from the wrong perspective . I invite you all to read his review but also note that there are maybe half a dozen or so things that he says in that review that are simply wrong , and this can be easily seen just by watching this incredible film . Roger , I love your work , and I have all of your books , but in this case , it seems that YOU may be the one with the ? condition ! '","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Quincy goes to his rescue & puts him out , talking to narcotics cop Sgt .

Episode 16 from season 8 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & one has to say save for some simply hilarious & horribly dated dialogue regarding drug use On Dying High is pretty poor . Some of the dialogue here has to be heard to be believed , from slang terms & words for the taking of drugs to funny descriptions of the drugs themselves it's horribly dated , it was made for telly so the language had to be kept clean & as such all these hard drug dealers & users talk like they are in Mary Poppins or something & it just sounds silly but that's the main attraction of this episode . It's not as unintentionally funny as the classic Next Stop , Nowhere ( 1983 ) about the punk music but it comes close . There's no murder mystery here & in fact no-one ends up on Quincy's autopsy table , there's no lab work , no detective work & it's just a horribly dated moralistic episode about the dangers of drugs from alcohol to cocaine & probably just about everything between . On Dying High is also notable since it's the episode where Quincy proposes to Emily & in true Quincy fashion gets a phone call mere seconds later & has to rush off ! When all said & done there's very little in this episode to enjoy or get involved with & some hilarious dialogue just isn't enough . At the start of On Dying High J . J . does a quick comedy routine involving jokes about drugs that really isn't funny at all , he can't sing either . While in hospital after being burnt the doctor's claim that J . J . ' s vocal chords were burnt but he manages to speak normally to Quincy & anyone else who comes to see him ! I'm not being funny or anything but I would have thought that if your vocal chords had been burnt you wouldn't be able to talk since they are things which allow speech , or am I wrong ? The acting is OK but the regular cast are better than the guest's as usual . On Dying High is another poor , moralistic based Quincy episode from the generally disappointing season eight & apart from some hilariously dated dialogue there's little here to get excited about .

Text2: In 1975 five guys were driving through the desolate forests of Arizona and one of them seems to have been killed or kidnapped by a giant pulsing orange UFO . The others take off and return in a hurry to town and don't report the incident . When they finally do , everyone else in the little community of Snowflake thinks that they killed Travis Walton ( D . B . Sweeney ) and left his body up there somewhere . Even the state's criminal investigator ( James Garner ) is skeptical . One or two thorough police searches of the area turn up nothing - - not the crater that the loggers claim was created by the UFO - - but no body either . Young Travis is missing for five days and nights , dressed only in denims , in the mountains where the temperature drops into the 20s ( F ) . When he turns up , he's naked , incoherent , bewhiskered , and looks slightly used . He tells his friends who , once again , delay reporting the return of the dead Walton . Later Walton , in a flashback , informs the authorities that he spent the missing time aboard a kind of space ship ( the decor of which closely resembles that of the crashed one in "" Alien "" ) , where he was covered by a kind of giant condom by wrinkled , pinkish crew members . The results of the polygraph tests are inconclusive , one of Walton's friends having walked out in the middle of his . ( He was hiding a criminal record . ) There has been considerable dissension among the five loggers , though the reasons are vague , and the movie ends on a note of uncertainty . The chief logger ( Robert Patrick , Agent Doggonit in "" The X Files "" ) and Walton visit the site of the incident a few years later . Walton has always blamed the others for leaving him behind and scurrying off . But now the two estranged friends make up , smile , and drive away from the site in peace . It doesn't really click for some reason . Except for James Garner , who is his reliable self , full of folk wisdom and common sense , the performances aren't very good , and they need to be , because the script wanders around from here to there , sometimes passing beyond implausible into positively dubious . Must ALL the townspeople glare at Patrick and the others - - in the café ? At the town hall meeting in the church ? And the film has surprisingly little in the way of sense of place , of local color . There is no vastness in this vast wilderness . The interiors of the working-class homes look like generic working-class "" homes "" . And the script is so weak it leaves us in doubt about what's going on with the polygraph tests . The dialog , even when delivered believably , lacks sparkle and tag lines . On the other hand , a lot of effort evidently went into Walton's experiences aboard the space ship . I don't know whether "" Alien "" ( 1979 ) was such a good influence on space ships or not . Before "" Alien "" all space ships were shiny , metallic , high-tech , impeccably clean and full of right angles . Since "" Alien "" they all look like something cobbled together out of Play-Do by a demented five-year-old kid , then poked full of holes , and squirted with organic honey . And why all this stuff about the horrifying experience anyway ? Val Lewton discovered that sometimes the scariest things of all are those that you don't see . They'd have been better off throwing that money into the script and the cast and coming up with an effective psychological drama and mystery . I can see a neat little film coming out of it . As it is , we're more or less forced into going along with Travis Walton's spectacular story , unless the detailed flashback is lying , as well as the five loggers . Were Walton and the others pulling a hoax for whatever reason ? Who knows . Walton must have made some money out of it - - he wrote a detailed book about the event and he's co-writer on this movie . That doesn't mean it didn't happen , of course . There is simply too much evidence from credible people that SOMETHING is going on , something entirely non-paradigmatic , and we don't have the slightest idea what it is . It's a stretch to think that aliens are behind it , but if they are , I have a suggestion for our extra-terrestrial visitors . Next time you decide to pluck somebody up and take him for a long ride into outer space , don't choose some redneck nobodies in boots and cowboy hats , with names like Lamar Oakum and Dwight ( "" Big Bobbie "" ) Thumm .

365,"Text1: J . T . LeRoy or Laura Albert or whoever wrote the collection of stories that created Jeremiah would probably take umbrage with Screenwriter / Director Asia Argento for turning Jeremiah's life of abuse and angst into a biography of Sarah , the mother who gave birth to Jeremiah at age 14 only to relinquish him to foster homes while she lead her life as a truck stop lizard and drug addict . While Asia Argento has impressive credentials as both actress and filmmaker in Italy , her on screen performance in this self-directed film is excessively focused on her and leaves the child of the stories as a mere sidebar . Much of the story line that ran through the book has been abandoned , probably due to the fact that few child actors could be asked to enact the bizarre and distorted things that Jeremiah did . Gone is the cross-dressing , the prostitution , and much of the other behavioral defects that peppered the pages of the novel . Instead we see a child claimed from a satisfactory foster home by a mother who jumps from one abusive lover to the next , leaving Jeremiah to fend for himself by eating out of garbage cans , living in slums and being at the beck and call of Sarah's consistently disgusting paramours . When Jeremiah is raped by one of Sarah's men he is sent to live with his crazed Bible belt grandparents where he is brainwashed into a zealot along with his cousins . He eventually is ' re-rescued ' by Sarah and once again the pointless existence presses on . There is no ending as there were / are further books to come . Asia Argento creates a fairly one-dimensional portrait of Sarah , that of a wasted bit of scum obedient only to her libido and drug needs . Yes , she fled from her parent's religious suffocation , but other than that we have no insight as to her behavior . The boys who portray Jeremiah ( Jimmy Bennett , Cole and Dylan Sprouse ) are just a bit too scrubbed and proper for the role and again we see little in the way of depth of character as Argento adapted the book . There are very brief bit parts by a number of fine actors ( one wonders why they wanted to do this ) such as Kip Pardue ( as buff as you'll ever see him ! ) , Winona Ryder , Michael Pitt , Peter Fonda , Marilyn Mason , Ben Foster , Jeremy Renner , and Jeremy Sisto but their appearances are strong despite the fleeting seconds in which they inhabit the screen . The ' form follows function ' rule certainly applies here : the story is shot is choppy , rancid colored , disorienting pieces that follow the style of the storytelling . The music is , well , loud and for the most part covers the dialogue ( not always a bad thing ) . This is an ' art film ' and one that takes patience to endure , but considering the great hoopla that accompanied the discovery of the ' J . T LeRoy ' scandal , it probably merits watching . For this viewer the film should have just been called ' Sarah - a tour de force for Asia Argento ' . Incidental information : the opening of the DVD is a multi-actor plea for support for ONE . org , a group of actors speaking out against poverty . It proves to be the most inspiring part of the disc ! Grady Harp

Text2: C . R . A . Z . Y . is a miraculous little film from Quebec written with pitch perfect dialogue by Jean-Marc Vallée and François Boulay , on whose memories of his own experiences the story is based , directed with tremendous zest and sensitivity by Jean-Marc Vallée , and with a cast of fine actors that would be impossible to duplicate . Yes , it really is that fine . The title of the film may put some people off as silly , so let it be said early on that the letters C . R . A . Z . Y . represent the first names of the sons of the Beaulieu family - and the fun , hilarious and touching story starts from there ! Christmas Day is the birth of Zachary Beaulieu ( impressive Marc-André Grondin as a young man and Émile Vallée as a youth ) , the fourth son of Gervais Beaulieu ( a brilliant Michel Côté ) and his seemingly perpetually pregnant wife Laurianne Beaulieu ( Danielle Proulx , a superb actress ) , and at his birth he is immediately dropped on the floor , ' dies ' for a few seconds , and is resuscitated , a fact which later leads his mother to consult her Tupperware friend / seer about Zachary's power from God to heal other people . The children include Raymond who is a boisterous youth and later a worthless drifter / panhandler ( played by Pierre-Luc Brilliant as a young man but also played as a youth by Emmanuel Raymond and Antoine Côté-Potvin ) ; Christian ( Maxime Tremblay as a young man and Jean-Alexandre Létourneau as a youth ; Antoine ( Alex Gravel as a young man and Sébastien Blouin as a youth ; and Yvan ( Félix-Antoine Despatie and Gabriel Lalancette ) . Each brother has a particular personality , whether a bookworm , an athlete , a ne're-do-well or a dreamer and we watch the family adapt to each of the brothers ' idiosyncrasies . But it is Zachary who is the focal point as he struggles with his sexual identity from childhood on through his teenage denial years while dating a girl , to his final longing for the unreachable relationship with a man as an adult . His ' powers ' of healing he uses to great advantage for his family and he gradually becomes disenchanted with the omnipresent Catholic Church , a force that plays heavily in his fantasy life and dreams and fears . As the years pass from 1960 to 1971 we are allow to watch a family connect , fragment and ultimately survive , always bound to traditions of holiday and love . Gervais claims all of the good points of his boys as patterned after him , yet as he faces Zachary's possibly being gay he balks and it is only after a mesmerizing life changing experience Zachary undergoes that Zachary and Gervais finally find the mutual love they have both needed . Though the film is long ( running time is over two hours ) the film seems to fly past us like a comet of experience to which we all can relate . The performances are so very powerful that they sweep us away with the amount of love they exhibit : Danielle Proulx as the mother is so subtle in the little things she does for her beloved though at times wayward sons that she glows and Michel Côté steals the screen as a father searching for understanding of his crew of crazy boys . But the revelation is Marc-André Grondin's embodiment of Zachary that is nothing short of a miracle of acting . There is not a weak moment in this little masterpiece of film-making and one hopes that it will be released and widely publicized in the theaters in the USA as it deserves standing ovations !

366,"Text1: There are few fence-riders where this movie is concerned . Most fans of the genre of Horror and of the sub-genre of WereWolf movies either love this movie . . . or hate it . Let me begin by saying that I admire this movie very much . I enjoy watching it , and the two subsequent sequels . In my opinion , after the third Howling , they got stupid , hokey , campy , and just plain bad . Also , let me warn you that this movie is dated , slow , and has large blocks of uneventful moments where even the most base character development is not being utilized . But , with that having been said , the story is a good story . It is poorly executed due to the large slow spots I mentioned before , but the story was a sound and well-written one . Everything does not just magically come together . The reporting team there as moral and emotional support for ace reporter , Karen White ( Dee Wallace ) , is working very hard to put it together . Their discoveries do not come easy , but rather as a result of hard work , open-mindedness , and diligence . Not luck . The cinematography is mostly unremarkable , except for the scene in which Bill is attacked . The filmography is beautiful there , with the moonlight streaming out from behind two great trees , and the scene between is clear and lit by a beautifully brilliant silvery moonlight . Very good stuff . I also loved the use of The Wolf Man , 1941 with Lon Chaney , Jr . as a source for information in their research . This is an instance in which a movie used a real movie to quote , rather than some made-up movie . Wes Craven's use of this element was highly praised in the Scream Trilogy , and yet , here it is , twenty years earlier . This production also features a cameo by Forrest J . Ackerman , movie actor with credits in over 20 B-grade horror flicks , and a very good ( if somewhat over the top ) supporting performance by John Carradine . Naturally , most fans of the horror genre want to compare this movie to An American Werewolf in London . That is , of course , like comparing apples to submarines in that the former is a B production , with a small budget and the latter is a much larger funded project at exactly TEN times the budget . The Howling had a 17M return from a 1M investment , while AWiL had a 30 . 5M return from a 10M budget . Let's see . . . 17X the investment / 3 . 5X the investment . I'd have to say "" The Howling "" is the big winner , here , as far as profit goes . I use profit as a measuring stick , because it seems that profit is all Hollywood cares about anymore . Art and artistic expression no longer seems to be the point of film making these days . But for the sake of art , I loved both movies , this one and its competitor . The make up artistry used here was excellent , and actually worthy of the story . That , along with truly professional performances by Dee Wallace and Christopher Stone , make this an enjoyable and memorable film , which I have recently added to my DVD collection . All in all , I consider "" The Howling "" to be a benchmark film in the sub-genre of werewolf movies . It rates a hard-won from . . . the Fiend : .

Text2:  Firewall  is good old-fashioned entertainment . It's nothing more . It doesn't attempt to become the next master-thriller ; nor does it try and achieve some type of infallible status , which is interesting since so many people here on the IMDb message boards have taken it upon themselves to dissect the plot to lengthy extremes . One user claims it's a technical error that Harrison Ford's character , Jack , uses a Windows operating system instead of Unix or Linux . People , it's a movie . And for the record , it was a personal computer in his office , not the computer the bank's database was stored on . I think part of the reason so many people are picking it apart is because they're all computer geeks who feel the need to prove how unrealistic the technology is in the film . They feel offended that Hollywood would not accurately reflect their world . Well , now they will perhaps understand why WWII vets hated the movie "" Pearl Harbor "" and historians in general hate any historical epic that Hollywood puts out . As it is , I was pleasantly surprised by the film's honest presentation of modern technology . Most computer-movies over the past decade ( films such as "" The Net "" ) seemed to never show anyone using realistic operating systems , and - the thing that always bugs me the most - people in movies NEVER use a mouse ; they just use their keyboards to seemingly do everything . "" Firewall "" is different . Even the Internet browsers and screensavers in the movie are those used by average people . It lends the film a more authentic sense . The plot is silly : Jack ( Ford ) works at a bank , where he oversees the security systems . His family is taken hostage by a gang of ruthless crooks ( led by Paul Bettany ) who demand that Jack assist them in breaking past the bank's security systems to steal $100 million . A lot of it doesn't make sense . Apart from questionable technology ( Jack hooks up a scanner to an iPod so he can store database numbers on the hard drive - "" It doesn't know the different between 10 , 000 songs and 10 , 000 bank account numbers "" according to the script ) , the crooks are some of the most incapable thieves ever . They spent a vast amount of time following Jack in preparation for their heist , but know absolutely nothing about the bank - and aren't even aware that the security system has recently been changed , therefore disallowing them from breaking in the way they had hoped . Plus , there's no firewall in the movie , except for a lame metaphor at the end . However , I was entertained . It's not great film-making by any means , and with better direction and scriptwriting it could have been more plausible a thriller , but it works fairly well as it is . Ford delivers a typically reliable performance and wipes the floor with Bettany , who was a major disappointment ( what happened ? ! He should have made a fantastic villain ) .

I must say I felt some anxiety from it , I was under a lot of stress from work at the time and it replaced the work related stress with the movie's tension . The film is stressful or unpleasant to watch . I give credit to the Italian director for creating evil , for evil is unpleasant and destructive . For evil would go after a dysfunctional family and rip it apart . Rape , murder , personal torture and the vile of evils quest is to destroy man . A movie that would disrupt sleep ; however the movie is so far off the real case from city confidential on A & E . The movie isn't even close to the real life story . The story is a scam or lie . I would give the movie a 7 for showing what is evil ( ie the director ) The story with this ending lowers the mark and the acting . High mark for family fights as good acting , but seeing the Jerry Springer show regularly at the local mall and working with dysfunctional coworkers and people is unpleasant like watching dog poop for an hour .

The best scene occurs with Davies in a military jeep , with Gray ; she is still disguised as a male officer , complete with moustache and a cap .

Text2: A common question to this movie is : If Karen Silkwood and her colleagues are so worried about being contaminated by plutonium at a processing plant then why do they smoke so many cigarettes if they're worried about their health ? Duh Because they volunteered to smoke ! They're adults and as adults they should be able to choose their own paths to hell . Even in 1973 the setting of this bio-pic everyone knew the risks of smoking related diseases and it's their health so if they want to ruin their health why should they be stopped from doing so ? ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! I don't know if it's irony on the point of director Mike Nichols but there does seem to be an awful lot of cigarette consumption in this movie . Certainly if there's any one wanting to give up the weed they should give this movie a miss . But the point remains that in 1973 ciggie packets carried government health warnings and everyone knew of the dangers even though they didn't want to admit it . Was the plutonium industry quite so honest ? What I liked about this collaboration between director Nichols and screenwriters Alice Arlen and Nora Ephron is that the audience is allowed to think for themselves on the issue of conspiracies and possible state sanctioned murders . Was Karen Silkwood bumped off for knowing too much and for being a trouble maker ? Possibly states the film but much of this is left somewhat ambiguous unlike say JFK by Oliver Stone . Likewise Karen's urine sample . Was it tampered with or was the radiation levels high because Karen was contaminated by a plutonium leak ? Once again the audience is left to make up there own minds Some people have criticized SILKWOOD because it feels very much like one of those cheap TVMs that even having a well known cast can't disguise . I won't disagree too much but this is because films of the period lacked much gloss and you can probably use the opposite argument in that nowadays Hollywood movies feature too much gloss and visual superficiality . Compare SILKWOOD with THE INSIDER or ERIN BROCKOVICH and make up your own mind if one's not glossy enough or the other two are too glossy to be effective . Certainly Nichols directs a scene where Karen walks through detectors and a jump cut occurs where she is undergoing decontamination procedure . I have no idea why but this scene shocked me to the core and this scene alone makes SILKWOOD a very memorable movie","{""output"": ""YES""}"
371,"Text1: The reason why I bought this was simple . Since I was on a DVD buying spree , and had picked up Johnnie To's The Mission ( see review here ) , I thought I might as well pick up yet another of his movies which I have not watched , and so PTU presented itself because of the price , and the uber cool slip case cover . PTU , or Police Tactical Unit , is quite unlike To's movies like the Election series , or The Mission . Here , we look at cops . Ordinary cops , who like everyone else , just want to go home safe and sound after their tour of duty . The movie started off with the sounds of the bustling streets of Hong Kong , before we find ourselves inside a police truck , with everyone in sombre mood during their trip to their patrol grounds of Tsim Sha Tsui , and listening quite ominously to an announcement over the radio regarding the death of a cop . And so begins am eventful night , which is the time period where PTU takes place in . We follow quite a number of characters - Lam Suet as Lo from the Anti-Crime Division , whose firearm was lost during a scuffle with thugs , and forms the crux of the story in which the lives of everyone else in the movie revolves around , Maggie Siu as Kat , sergeant of her team of PTU cops , and Simon Yam as Mike , her counterpart leading the other team . It's a great character study piece of the three main characters , initially one who knows he's in lots of trouble for the loss , and desperately trying to recover it , in order to save face , and keep his reputation intact for an upcoming promotion , Kat's sense of doing what's right , following procedure , and Mike , who's willing to risk it all to help another of his own "" for kay "" ( slang for cop ) . Under To's direction , PTU is a brilliant visual piece . Creative use of light and shadow illuminates PTU , making it a visual spectacle , so much that you'll still enjoy the movie even if you turn off the volume . I particularly enjoyed the rather quiet moments which were plenty throughout the movie , rather than the usual wham-bang kind of action with guns ablazing . In fact , a shot is never even fired , until the end-all finale , combining all the separate threads of the story into one heck of a finale . What could probably raise eyebrows , are the unorthodox methods employed by the upholders of the law . You can't help but ponder over the methods , and how the lieutenants either turn a blind eye to , or are in full agreement with the provocative procedures meted out by their captain . Surely a talking point , if fire should be met with fire when dealing with scum . There are many subtle touches in this compact tale of less than 90 minutes , with the ubiquitous mobile phone being so important as a plot element , and that strong sense of irony in the narrative . And again in To's cops and robbers / triad movies ( though I may be wrong ) , it seemed that the cool soundtrack which is peppered throughout the film , seemed to stem from a single primary theme music , this time with some electric guitar riffs . PTU doesn't get bogged down by wasting time explaining the many whys and how comes , and prefers to zap you right into the moment . It's the sense of contemplative urgency that makes it compelling to watch , and every turn brings something unexpected . The ending is particular interesting too , especially for those who have written statements in uniformed groups - you surely know what they're doing !

Text2: People tend to use the word "" classic "" too freely . I can't help but laugh when I hear some of the movies that people call "" classics "" . The term gets thrown around so much that it often looses some of its importance and real meaning . I try to reserve "" classic "" to a select group of films that I believe have achieved a certain status and have withstood the test of time . And I have no problem putting the label "" classic "" on The Invisible Man . James Whale made a lot of great films in the 1930s . Some ( Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein , for example ) may be better known , but I've always thought of The Invisible Man as the best of the bunch . It's got everything . Terrific performances , incredible special effects , nice comedic touches , and technical brilliance are found in abundance throughout the film . - Terrific Performances : For someone who only has a few seconds of actual screen time , Claude Rains is amazing . His voice creates such a presence that at times it's easy to forget that he's not actually there . As for Una O'Connor , I've seen some people complain about Whale's use of her , but I think she was never better than in The Invisible Man . She's great whether playing the proper landlord showing a new guest to his room or as the overly hysterical woman afraid for her life . The rest of the cast , especially E . E . Clive and Gloria Stuart , is exceptional . - Incredible Special Effects : It's amazing to revisit The Invisible Man and see how well the special effects have withstood the passage of time . They were state-of-the-art in 1933 and they remain impressive today . It took some real craftsmanship to pull-off the invisibility gags seen in The Invisible Man . To me , none is more impressive than the first time we get a glimpse under the bandages while he's eating and we see no lower jaw . Impressive stuff ! - Nice Comedic Touches : Billed as a horror film , The Invisible Man actually contains more scenes of humor than horror . I've already mentioned O'Connor , but she's only a small part of the humor in the film . The police , the various frightened passersby , and even Claude Rains himself add to the fun found in The Invisible Man . I'm of the opinion that it never goes overboard , but fits nicely into the plot . - Technical Brilliance : Beyond the special effects , the film is wonderful from a technical standpoint . Lighting , cinematography , and set design are incredible and some of the best of the 30s . Everything looks perfect . In my opinion , Whale never did better . I've always been impressed by the way Whale used his camera as part of the action when many of his contemporaries seemed content with the "" plant it and shoot "" style of film-making . The only negative aspect of the film that I can possibly complain about is William Harrigan in the role of Rains ' rival , Dr . Arthur Kemp . He's just not as good as those around him . Other than that little quibble , I've got nothing to complain about . I believe it should be easy to see why I , for one , consider The Invisible Man a classic !","{""output"": ""NO""}"
372,"Text1:  Mildred Pierce  is a strange mix of women's picture and film noir . In typical noir fashion , the film begins with a murder and flashes back to the events that led up to it . It also has the standard issue noir look ; veteran director Michael Curtiz knew his way around a movie set , and gives his film a moody , shadowy look perfectly at home among the "" Maltese Falcon's "" and "" Double Indemnity's "" of the decade . But the story is pure melodrama , full of motherly suffering and gauzy swoonings . If you crossed Douglas Sirk with Raymond Chandler , you might get something like this . Joan Crawford is wonderful in the title role , and the movie clearly exists to showcase the talents of its star . Ann Blyth is nearly demonic as Mildred's spoiled-brat daughter , Veda . And Eve Arden plays the only kind of character she was ever allowed to play , that of the acerbic , wise-cracking best friend . The men in the film are nearly an afterthought , interesting seeing as this movie came out during WWII . This is yet another of those films from the same time period that offered a hypothetical warning about what would happen to the homefront if women carried on in the roles traditionally reserved for men .

Text2: Hardened WWII Marine is shipwrecked on an island in the Pacific with a nun so saintly she glows . Sure , the set-up is contrived but the actors ( Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr ) play up the screenplay's strengths and bring humor to the scenario .

Text2: The four best known novels of Samuel Clemens are "" Tom Sawyer "" , "" Huckleberry Finn "" , "" The Prince and the Pauper "" , and "" A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court "" . All four were turned into films on several occasions . His fifth best novel is "" Pudd'nhead Wilson "" , written in 1894 , which is his last novel set in the Mississippi Valey he grew up in and loved . Set in 1835 to 1856 , "" Pudd'nhead Wilson "" is ( like "" Huckleberry Finn "" ) a serious look at slavery and it's effects on all people . Twain is trying to show that it demoralized everyone , and just wrecked lives . In fact , it makes the situation facing the escaping slave Jim in "" Huckleberry Finn "" look relatively irritating but almost bearable - and Jim is separated from his wife and kids by the system . In "" Wilson "" , a slave Roxy is almost sold down river ( to the harsher plantations of the deep south ) when suspected of theft . She has had a baby , and she realizes what an uncertain future Chambers ( short for "" Valet de chambres "" ) faces . Her mistress has just died in childbirth , giving birth to Tom Driscoll . He and the light skinned Chambers looks very similar - so she switches them . She reasons that later on she will reveal the truth to the real Chambers , and he will be grateful for what she did . But her son becomes a spoiled brat , and a wastrel . Why shouldn't he be , when he lives in a system where he commands all these slaves ? He even stabs "" Chambers "" ( the real Tom ) for displeasing him at one point . Roxy tries to control him - but "" Tom "" ( the real Chambers ) is uncontrollable . When he does learn the truth he tries to shut her up by selling her downriver . As for "" Chambers "" ( the real Tom ) he becomes a downtrodden slave - he is a good person , but he lacks education , and he is frightened of his safety around the clock . Twain's point is brilliantly developed - in a slave culture nobody prospers . "" Tom "" ( the real Chambers ) is heir to his uncle , Judge Driscoll . He really frightens "" Tom "" because of the threat of disinheritance - especially as "" Tom "" is a physical coward . The threat of his fighting a duel with one of a pair of Italian twins who have moved to the area leads ( briefly ) to his being disinheritance . But "" Tom "" manages to give a sophistic excuse that his uncle accepts . The story has other interesting aspects , including the first use of "" fingerprinting "" in a novel to solve a crime . And it is loaded with the humorous aphorisms and saying of Puddn'head Wilson himself . Pudd'nhead is actually David Wilson , a lawyer who moves to the town and practices their . A comment he makes labels him a "" Pudd'nhead "" because the yokels don't realize he has a clever ironic sense of humor . He really is not a "" puddinghead "" ( a fool ) and actually rises to be town mayor as well as the person who reestablishes justice at the end of the story . This television version was part of the series of Mark Twain stories that appeared in the early 1980s and is ( so far ) the only modern version of the story on film . Ken Howard was quite good as "" Pudd'nhead "" and Steven Weber gave a good performance as "" Tom "" ( the real Chambers ) . The film is well worth catching if you can see it .

376,"Text1: I didn't quite know what to make of "" Paradise Alley "" when it first came out in 1978 , and quite truthfully , I don't quite know what to make of it today . Back in the mid 1960's I became quite a fan of professional wrestling , oxymoron as that description is . So it was the wrestling theme that prompted me to see it during it's theatrical release . Coming off the success of "" Rocky "" , it was as if Sylvester Stallone had to follow up that first hit with another self propelled film as writer , actor and director . The comparisons to "" Rocky "" , inevitable as they are , should be a cautionary one though . The former was a true diamond in the rough honored as "" Best Picture "" , while "" Paradise "" and it's characters have trouble defining themselves in post War 1946 Hell's Kitchen . It seems as if each of the Carboni Brothers undergoes a personality change during the story . Cosmo ( Stallone ) is the schemer who prompts Victor ( Lee Cannalito ) to become a wrestler by going up against and defeating the house champion Big Glory ( Frank McRae ) . Brother Lenny ( Armand Assante ) is at first protective of Victor , but with the wrestler's success in the ring , the tables turn and Cosmo begins to question Lenny's ethics and handling of the purses . Lenny becomes the stereotype of a boxing manager , deflecting questions about his integrity and how he's handling Vic's money . For me , a couple of things didn't ring true historically for the film's 1940's setting . The characters of Annie ( Anne Archer ) and Bunchie ( Joyce Ingalls ) looked just a little bit too glamorous for the story's backdrop . As for the wrestling scenes , though well done and featuring some of the mid ' 70's top mat stars , they were based quite heavily on the actual wrestling style of the seventies . You had your grappling moves defined by flips and throws , punctuated by a Ray Stevens maneuver as he catapults into a turnbuckle . However most mat action prior to the 1960's was anything but , with rare exception . Even the widely available 1960 championship bout between Buddy Rogers and Pat O'Connor featured a lot of stale and boring rest holds . Ironically , I just saw this film again on the cable Yes Network hosted by Yogi Berra in a format titled "" Yogi and a Movie "" . Between scenes , the famed Yankee great would talk about his youth and watching pro wrestlers like Lou Thesz and Strangler Lewis . Story boards between acts mentioned a lot of trivia about the film that appears on the IMDb site for this movie , which leads me to believe that it could have been a reference point for the presentation . There are a number of reasons to check out "" Paradise Alley "" , and not just to be a Stallone completist . The filming style , particularly some of the bar scenes with their red tint lends a certain uniqueness to the movie . Another is the voice of Sly Stallone singing "" Too Close to Paradise "" over the opening credits and the rooftop race against "" Rat "" ( Paul Mace ) . The one scene though that will test your patience is Victor singing to his parakeet , it's probably the one scene in film history that had me wishing for fingernails on a chalkboard .

Text2: If you call yourself a classic horror movie fan , then you've either seen "" White Zombie "" , or it better be on your must see list . The opening of the film is itself a visual and auditory treat , replete with voodoo drums and chanting , punctuating stylized graphics that spell out the title . As expected , the film is set in Haiti , smack in the middle of voodoo and zombie territory . The atmosphere is heavy with foreboding right from the start , as a stage driver carrying an engaged couple navigates his way past walking corpses and the mysterious Murder Legendre ( Bela Lugosi ) . Lugosi's signature eye stare captivates the pretty Madeleine Parker ( Madge Bellamy ) , and he lays hostage to her scarf as the stage pulls away . He'll use it later to taunt plantation owner Charles Beaumont ( Robert Frazer ) , whose been in love with Madeleine since an earlier encounter . Beaumont begs Legendre for his help in stealing Madeleine away from her fiancé Neil Parker ( John Harron ) only an hour away from their wedding . Legendre's response : "" There . . . . is . . . . a . . . . way . . . . "" , in that signature Lugosi tone . In a scene designed to induce nightmares , Legendre slowly carves a candle and twists it in a flame to mesmerize Madeleine and seemingly cause her death . The event causes Neil to drink himself into a stupor as he tries to come to grips with his fate . His lone ally is missionary Dr . Gruber ( Joseph Cawthorn ) , who after thirty years on the island is about to concede that something strange may indeed be happening here . When Neil discovers that her coffin is empty , Gruber opines that Madeleine may either have had her body stolen , or else she's not dead . For his part , the sinister Lugosi gets a lot of mileage out of the full frame closeup of his eyes , and the ritual handclasp that he uses to give inaudible commands to his victims , whether they be alive or dead . His countenance is so fearful that even his eyebrows have eyebrows . It's with rather unnerving glee that he begins to transform Beaumont himself into a zombie , after he appeals to Legendre to bring Madeleine back to life - what a revolting thought ! As the film nears it's end , Legendre's Dead Crew make their appearance for one more time to dispatch Silver , up till now the loyal butler . But finally , it's Dr . Bruner to the rescue as he gets the drop on Lugosi , who follows his minions over the cliff of his mountaintop castle . As the smile on Madeleine's face begins to return , we realize that Legendre's grip on the island is now over . "" White Zombie "" followed Bela Lugosi's signature film "" Dracula "" by only one year , with five other movies in between , a rather prolific schedule . It's got just about all you would want in a 1930's "" B "" horror flick - great sets , dark and moody atmosphere , and tension that builds from creepy to creepier to creepiest .

377,"Text1: In this day and age , it's no doubt a real shock for us to learn that Sean Connery once starred in a Disney movie . . . and even sang ! As "" Darby O'Gill and the Little People "" is a Disney movie set in Ireland , we have to admit that it basically makes a series of stereotypes about the Emerald Isle - namely all the leprechaun stuff - and can probably only appeal to little children . My favorite parts were actually the scenes of the Banshee ; Darby really could have used the Ghostbusters there . So , if we can understand what the movie's portraying , maybe we can appreciate it . But given the ever-present situation in Northern Ireland , it just seems inappropriate to happily depict that island as a bunch of jolly leprechauns . As for the wee people themselves , my two favorite representations of them were the Porky Pig cartoon "" Wearing of the Grin "" and the horror movie "" Leprechaun "" ( starring Jennifer Aniston ) . I know , you probably find it a little weird that I reviewed a Disney movie and mentioned stereotypes , the Ghostbusters , England's continued occupation of Northern Ireland , Porky Pig and Jennifer Aniston . Sorry folks , but the 21st century judges all previous history . Therefore , I judge "" DOATLP "" based on what I know about , and based on what has happened since the movie's release . Yeah , when this movie came out , who would have guessed that the young man would go on to play a hunky British agent who goes around bedding the world's hottest babes ? And what if someone extended the last name to "" O'Gilligan "" ? Now that would make some three-hour tour !

Text2: I guess that it's debatable whether or not Vincent Price was the greatest horror star ever , but "" House on Haunted Hill "" certainly suggests so . He plays Frederick Loren , who is offering five people $10 , 000 each to stay in a possibly haunted mansion overnight . Part of the deal is that no one is allowed to leave . To complicate matters , his wife Annabelle ( Carol Ohmart ) appears to have some slimy plans up her sleeve . Meanwhile , one of the guests , Watson Pritchard ( Elisha Cook , Jr ) , is adamant about telling the other guests of the evil things that happened in the mansion ( "" This is where the girl was found . Whatever got her wasn't human ! "" ) . As you might imagine , things get progressively weirder and creepier for the guests as the night drags on . 1959 may have been the annus mirabilis for both Vincent Price and William Castle , as they collaborated on this movie and also "" The Tingler "" . Some people may classify "" House on Haunted Hill "" as another one of the horror movies that dominated ' 50s cinema , but I beg to differ . This movie is Americana , far more than apple pie or baseball . It's not just that these sorts of movies were a life-saving alternative to the "" family fun "" .

378,"Text1: Director João Pedro Rodrigues and writer Paulo Rebelo ( ' O Fantasma ' ) collaborate again on this fascinating ( if a bit frustrating ) Portuguese film ODETE ( ' Two Drifters ' ) . Together they have their own brand of surrealism and exploration of fantasies that seems to be developing into a smart new look for cinema . The very controversial ' O Fantasma ' was dark and brooding , tearing open psyches like feral dogs along the slums of Portugal , whereas ' Two Drifters ' is a work in the daylight that moves the concentration from men only to men and women - but the extremes of behavior are still in sharp focus . The film opens with a very tender moment between handsome student Pedro ( João Carreira ) and his working boyfriend Rui ( Nuno Gil ) : it is their anniversary but their individual obligations prevent them from spending more than a hasty goodbye , exchanging rings , and off goes Pedro in his car only to be killed in a crash . Devastated , Rui attends to Pedro and then to the horror of sitting by his casket during the wake before the funeral . Flash into storyline two : the beautiful store skater Odete ( Ana Cristina De Oliveira ) lives with her lover Alberto ( the hunky Carloto Cotta ) but when she announces she would like to have a child , Alberto flees and Odete is left in depression over her plight . She just happens to be a neighbor of the recently dead Pedro and in her loneliness she attends Pedro's wake , follows the casket through the funeral and to the grave where she begins to obsess over the dead Pedro . She spends her time draped across his grave , fantasizes that she is pregnant by him and confronts Pedro's mother with the concept . She truly has pseudosiesis ( false imagined hysterical pregnancy ) and when it is an exposed condition she alters her appearance , cutting her hair and wearing Pedro's clothes and even convincing Pedro's mother to let her sleep in his bed . Ultimately Odete , now inhabiting the persona of Pedro , rejects Albert's return to her graces and instead enters into a bizarre arrangement with Rui . The actors are all physically beautiful people , superbly cast to fit the models of the personalities of the story , and they manage to make this rather incredible tale credible . The film is rich in symbolism and metaphors , among them the title of the English version ' Two Drifters ' - a phrase taken form the favorite fantasy song ' Moon River ' that is the theme of Pedro's and Rui's relationship . There are some distorted sexual scenes and innuendos that may be off-putting to some , but the inclusion works for the story . It is a tough little film but dazzling in its brave little way of taking chances , making us eager to see what João Pedro Rodrigues will do next ! Grady Harp

Text2: KEY WEST : CITY OF COLORS is a fine little documentary meant by its creator Talmadge to focus on the unraveling of a 1 and mile long Rainbow Flag down Dylan Street connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico . The beauty of the film is not just the documentation of this 2003 event marking the 25th anniversary of the creation of the Rainbow Flag by Gilbert Baker , it is also a celebration of the little island of Key West and the people who live there . Creator Talmadge Hayward presents a brief history of this isolated island at the far southern tip of the United States ( closer to Cuba than to Miami ! ) , showing old photographs of the sponge business , the piracy , the smuggling , and the ever present cohabitation of African Americans , Hispanics , famous artists , wealthy , poor , gay and straight citizens . He then spends a great deal of the film in interviews with many of the residents - some lifelong some newly transplanted - who explain in warm and simple terms why this oasis for acceptance is an oasis for human kind . The colors are rich , the parade of the flag unfolding from ocean to gulf is magnificent and inspiring , and the message of peaceful coexistence serves as a goal for us all .

D . starts as New York police detective Harry Griswold ( Rick Gianasi ) decides to go to a Japanese theatre but has his night ruined when a bunch of machine gun wielding thugs burst in & begin shooting up the place , the owner of the theatre manages to breathe his dying Kabukiman spirit into Harry who over the next few days experiences some strange transformations . He suddenly becomes Kabukiman a Japanese superhero who fights crime & evil , speaking of evil an ancient Japanese legend states that every 1000 years ' the evil one ' will take form on earth & well generally be evil & this is the year so Kabukiman is charged with the task of stooping him . Directed by the ' brains ' behind Troma Michael Herz & Lloyd Kaufman this is actually far better than I expected considering their general output . The script by Kaufman , Andrew Osborne & Jeffrey W . Sass is a clear homage to the superhero genre with some mildly amusing scenes that rip-off the likes of Batman , The Incredible Hulk , Spider-Man & Superman . Not everything works but at least it tries without having to resort to the stupid , childish gross out humour & violence most Troma films rely on & in fact this is surprisingly restrained & light hearted compared to a lot of Troma's output , whether this is a good or bad thing I'll let you decide but I thought it made watching it a lot easier . Everything about Sgt . Kabukiman N . Y . P . D . seems just that bit better than the usual Troma film which obviously helps , it isn't going to win any awards but as trashy entertainment that makes you smile on occasion it's not too bad . Director's Herz & Kaufman do OK , while still not up to Hollywood standards this has a greater level of technical competence than any other Troma film I can remember . As already mentioned this is surprisingly tame , apparently available in two versions of differing strength I'm not sure which one I saw but as far as gore goes there's some people shot in the head , some is attacked by a Tiger & eaten plus there's a silly blue demon monster thing at the end . This probably had a slightly bigger budget than the usual Troma & it show's , apparently this didn't get distributed in the States until 1996 some 5 years after it was initially made . Again while the acting isn't going to win any awards it's much better than in most Troma films . Sgt . Kabukiman N . Y . P . D . isn't too bad a film & one if watched in the right mood provides a few decent laughs although you have to be of a certain disposition to enjoy stuff like this . Worth a watch for those twisted souls wanting something a bit different .

Text2: Great Quincy episode . Rating 8 This comment may contain spoilers Quincy M . E . : Requiem for the Living starts late one night as Los Angeles chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his assistant Sam ( Robert Ito ) are finally able to leave the laboratory after a long day & head to Danny's for a game of poker with the boy's . However while in the parking lot Quincy & Sam are taken hostage at gunpoint by mob boss Vincent DiNardi ( John Vernon ) , escorted back into the laboratory DiNardi reveals that he has just found out he is dying from lung disease & has less than twenty four hours to live , DiNardi claims that he has been poisoned & that he wants Quincy to perform an autopsy on himself while still alive to determine the cause of the poisoning & who was responsible at which point DiNardi will order that persons death as one final act of revenge . . . Episode 20 from season 3 Requiem for the Living was the final episode of the third season of Quincy & it was a cracking last episode , directed by Rowe Wallerstein this is yet another story which proves how versatile the premise of Quincy actually was & how varied the stories could actually be & certainly during it's first five or six season were . The main gimmick of Requiem for the Living is that Quincy is ordered to perform an autopsy on a living person rather than a cadaver which is a nice twist & one that the series used a number of times as during the eight season run Quincy autopsied animals including horses & goldfish , Egyptian Mummies , murder cases , suicides & even nothing more than a few bones . I enjoy the crime based Quincy episodes much more than the moralistic ones & it's great that there's a murder mystery element here , there's the personal threat as Sam & Quincy are held hostage at gunpoint & there's even a nice little twist at the end which I for one didn't see coming , the killers motives are not exactly brilliant ( why kill someone who has just brought you an entire apartment complex ? ) but it's only a fifty minute episode , what do you want ? This one has a great pace about it , there's some nice interplay & dialogue between Quincy & DiNardi as he tries to convince Quincy that despite his line of work & who he is he is an honourable man . All in all a great episode that Quincy fans should love . As usual this episode of Quincy is not going to win any awards for style but the terrific story more than makes up for the slightly dull visuals . Set almost entirely in the laboratory , we never actually find out what happens to Chuck the security guard . He isn't shown being rescued so maybe poor old Chuck starved to death tied up as everyone forgot about him & his skeleton is lying around somewhere in the Los Angeles county coroner's office ready to be discovered & have a Quincy like pathologist poke around it trying to figure out if it was murder . . . There's some great casting here as the late prolific John Vernon plays the heavy role he is so good at although I can't decide if I liked him better in Requiem for the Living or the amazingly loopy & brilliant Killer Klown from Outer Space ( 1988 ) , Jack Klugman as Quincy is superb as usual but I come to expect no less from such a terrific actor . Requiem for the Living is an absolutely terrific classic episode of Quincy with a great plot , a solid murder mystery where the victim is still alive & some good twists which help make this one of my favourite Quincy episodes .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
380,"Text1: Out of an Alain Delon three-film marathon , this was the one I was most looking forward to but , surprisingly , ended up being the most disappointing . The fact that the Italian TV broadcast suffered from intermittent instances of bad reception had a lot to do with this , I guess , but I also found the film ( which was adapted from a novel by crime expert Jose ' Giovanni , dealing with a search for treasure lost at sea ) rather an inconsequential trifle ! Still , the proceedings are considerably bolstered by attractive locations , the delectable Joanna Shimkus ( even if her character , who hitches with stars Delon and Lino Ventura far too quickly , is killed off half-way through ) and Francois de Roubaix's delightful score . Delon ? playing a dashing , reckless flier ? is his typically inexpressive self , but Ventura is as strong as ever as his inventor / racing-car enthusiast partner ; also notable is Serge Reggiani as a nervous yet shifty hanger-on who eventually reveals the exact whereabouts of the crashed airplane in which the loot is stashed . Incidentally , the abandoned fortress in mid-ocean ( Shimkus dreams of owning it , but which is eventually purchased by Ventura after her demise with his share of the recovered fortune ) is a great setting ? which director Enrico ably employs for the film's action climax ( even if the gangsters who assault Ventura and Delon , who are also after the money , make for a bunch of anonymous villains ) .

Text2: The Browning / Lugosi ' classic ' has always been one of my favorite Universal horror films but , ever since the simultaneously-produced ' rival ' Spanish version resurfaced , the ' original ' has taken a beating by fans and historians alike - mainly because the latter features superior camera-work ! This , however , is the ONLY area where it can lay a claim to be better in when compared to the US version ( the fact that leading lady Lupita Tovar had a sexier wardrobe than Helen Chandler shouldn't even be considered , I guess ) . Still , the fact that on the DVD the opinion that the seminal US version is the inferior one seems to be shared by quite a few people hasn't done it any favors ! I remember being impressed by the Spanish version when I first watched it in 2001 , singling out for praise the performance of Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield and , of course , George Robinson's cinematography . However , coming back to it now , I felt that Rubio's hysterical rendering of the character ( which reminded me of Gene Wilder in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN [ 1974 ] of all people ! ) was nowhere nearly as nuanced as Dwight Frye's unforgettable characterization in the US version . Regarding the "" superior camera-work "" , I guess this is true for individual sequences ( Dracula's introduction , for instance ) but , frankly , I never felt that Karl Freund - a pioneer of the moving camera - had somehow been restrained by Tod Browning , who admittedly wasn't very fond of this technique . Given that of late we've also been faced by the ridiculous assumption that Browning didn't actually direct the film , he couldn't have - since he wasn't even there ! ! It may be however , that since frequent Browning collaborator Lon Chaney ( who had been slated for the title role ) died before shooting began , the director sort of lost heart in the project - coupled also with the fact that the script was rather talky , another element with which Browning felt uneasy ! Well , whatever went on behind the scenes , for me what's in front remains one of the highlights of the American horror film - from the marvelous dialogue ( especially as delivered - each in their own unique way - by Lugosi , Frye and Edward Van Sloan ) , irreproachable performances ( Frye and Van Sloan were at their best , while Lugosi only ever really came close with THE BLACK CAT [ 1934 ] and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN [ 1939 ] ) and memorable individual scenes ( the entire first act set in Transylvania , the confrontation scenes between Dracula and his nemesis Professor Van Helsing , Renfield's various ravings ) . The tame ending may appear anti-climactic to most people but I honestly was never bothered by it ! If anything , this was remedied in any number of ways in subsequent outings . . . Which brings us back to the Spanish Dracula : like I said , the film is an interesting and altogether pleasing ' alternate ' to the Lugosi version . . . but it is fatally compromised by the inadequate leading performance of Carlos Villarias , whose bulging eyes and feral snarls can't hold a candle to Lugosi's definitive screen vampire ! This version does go to places where the American doesn't ( Browning shies away from the vampire attacks , for instance ) and even features ' new ' scenes like the aftermath of the vampiric Lucy's demise - but , at 104 minutes ( a full half-hour longer than the US version , when considering that they were following the same script ! ) it's way overlong for its own good . The Browning / Lugosi version is often criticized for its sluggishness but this one actually moves at a snail's pace : take , for instance , the famous scene where Dracula is exposed by the mirror - Lugosi knocks the box down immediately , while Villarias takes forever to do so ( even if his resolution is effectively flamboyant nonetheless ) . A word about the DVD quality : disappointingly , the Spanish version features closed-captions ( for the hearing-impaired ) rather than proper subtitles . As for the US version , the print utilized for this particular transfer ( which differs from that of the original , and more satisfactory , 1999 release ) is a bit too dark for my taste and the dialogue sometimes was hard to catch due to the incessant hiss on the soundtrack ! It also reverts to the ' original ' single groan during Dracula's staking ( instead of the elongated variant available on the earlier disc ) . . . but does feature a bit of music at the end of the Opera sequence , which had been missing from the previous edition ! ! Well , this only means that it's worth keeping both copies of Dracula as neither is really definitive . . .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

But I will say that no collection is complete without this movie . It is so wretchedly bad it's funny . First of all , hardly anybody gets eaten . After Jaws gobbles up the youngest Brody son Mom goes on a holiday to get away from Amity Island and it's history . . . to the Bahamas ! Total change of scenery huh ? Jaws follows . How ? Don't ask me . And he gets there in a day when it would take any ordinary shark about a week minimum . Her elder son works as a marine biologist ( surely being attacked by sharks in the first two movies would put him off going in the ocean ) and is studying sea snails ( presumably he got fired from Sea World after Jaws 3 ) . By pure coincidence ( or contrivance ) , Jaws shows up and pokes his nose into the sea snail research . The shark looks sooooooooooooo fake . It's very obviously nothing but foam rubber with plastic teeth . And it's incredibly stupid . The shark in the first film ( and in the surprisingly good second ) seemed to be kind of smart and cunning . But now it's just a big lumbering idiot . Why on earth Michael Caine agreed to be in this is beyond me . He even couldn't get to the Oscars to accept his award for Hannah and her Sisters because he was too busy filming this turkey . And the story with him dating Mom Brody takes up a tremendous amount of the film's running time and ends up turning it into a soap opera . The worst thing tho , isn't the elder Brody son's beard or Mario Van Peebles ' Jamaican accent . It's the ending . Let me explain what happens . . . Jaws stands on his tail ! On the Water ! ! Roars like a Lion ! ! ! Is stabbed by the broken mast of a ship . . . . . . and explodes ! ! ! ! Of course ! Where on earth the idea for that ending came from is probably best kept a mystery . The fact that it recycles footage from the first film into this ending is a mockery of the original's genius . It should also be noted that this version includes the happy ( alternate ) ending in Mario Van Peebles survives being chomped across the belly by the big fish . This new DVD release by Universal improves upon the shoddy , OOP Goodtimes release . Gone is the snapper cover , now we have a sturdy keepcase . The picture is now anamorphic and although the 2 . 35 : 1 frame has some dirt on it , it's rather sharp . The Dolby 2 . 0 soundtrack is just about average though . The only extra is a trailer .

Text2: You can't move for sequels , prequels , spin-offs and remakes ( or re-imaginings ) these days . Hollywood is suffering a real dry spell when it comes to new blood as most stuff we get now is from previously released material . Some remakes can be impressive ( Dawn of the Dead , Texas Chainsaw Massacre ) and others can be downright pointless ( Alfie ! ) . Taxi is an obscure choice . The original French version was written by Luc Besson in 21 days out of pure boredom as he waited for Columbia to green light The Fifth Element . It was an okay , silly action movie that spawned 2 sequels itself . While it's a mildly popular film it's hardly the kind of thing that warrants an American remake . How many Americans ( or anyone outside of France ) cared for the original Taxi ? As ramshackle as it is , Taxi NYC still seems to hold together thanks to the energetic performances of Queen Latifa and Jimmy Fallon . They do what the can with the limp material and are capable of duping you into believing that the movie is better than it really is . What's so bad about it ? Well , the plot is non-existent and is really just a set-up for a couple of brief chase scenes featuring Latifa's suped-up Taxi . Director Tim Story tries to copy the easy-going pastel-colored design and liberated use of widescreen photography of the original as well as keeping the speed of the chases as fast as he can but the stuff in between is so dated and his direction feels like the kind of quality film-making you'd expect of Rush Hour 86 . Plus , the sexuality of the original film has been erased . In France this would have been called harmless but in America they call it pornography . It's hard to give this film a bad review as there is at least one good laugh per scene but the cheap , cruddiness of it prevents it from being anything more than a one-time only rental that won't really hold up upon repeat viewings . Trust me . The DVD is in great looking 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with good enough Dolby 5 . 1 sound . The sound design is hardly anything to write home about so don't expect to . The DVD I watched ( Region 2 ) had an extended version of the film that ran 6 minutes longer .

Instead of the normal Western-style narrative , this animated short is one long piece of art - - obviously inspired by Indian paintings of birds , people and the afterlife . All this gorgeous action unfolds slowly and is accompanied by the ethereal music of Gheorghe Zamfir - - an internationally known ( except in the US ) panpipes legend whose music I have loved for years . Combined , it's an absolutely inspiring and breathtaking piece of art . Because it was such a lovely film , it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film - - which it lost to CHARADE . I don't know exactly how I feel about this , as I've seen both . CHARADE is funny and very clever but a rather superficial film . PARADISE is more a work of art and less a film for the public at large . Personally , I am happy either way , as they both were delights - - too bad they couldn't give the award to both ! !

Text2: You'll probably never see a review of this film that doesn't make reference to Wes Craven's classic ' The Last House on the Left ' , and there's a good reason for that ; as this film has basically the exact ( and I mean EXACT ) same plot , only instead of a couple of young girls being raped , beaten and humiliated in the woods , they're raped , beaten and humiliated on board a train . Of course , I knew that this was the case before I began watching the film ; but I was honestly expecting the two to differ a lot more than they actually do . I do sometimes wonder about my mental health when I purposefully track down and enjoy films like this one and The House on the Edge of the Park ; films that are famous purely for relentless violence , but I can rest easy with this one as it really isn't all that enjoyable . The plot follows a couple of young women that decide to take a train ride in celebration of the holidays . However , their bad luck is in when it turns out that a trio of lunatics have also decided to ride the train that day ; and the meeting between the two parties is pleasurable for one side only ! The main problem with this film is the fact that the first hour is unbelievably dull and there isn't a lot going on in the way of plot or violence . The early scenes set up the movie - but they go on too long , and the film even descends into political discussion on several occasions - and I may be on my own here , but that's not what I want from an exploitation flick . What I do want from an exploitation flick is violence , and the film doesn't completely deliver on that front either . There are unpleasant scenes aplenty in the final third , but one sequence aside ; they're not all that shocking . The saving grace of Night Train Murders is director Aldo Lado's attention to detail . He makes good use of his mobile setting , and the train always seems a claustrophobic and unpleasant place to be . Ennio Morricone's score isn't one of his best , and merely goes along with the common exploitation beat . Anyone who has seen The Last House on the Left will know how it all ends , but it fails to pack a punch because the characters are so hard to care for , and Lado doesn't manage to make the audience really hate the villains . Overall , this film isn't very good ; but there are a few positives , and exploitation completists may get a kick out of it .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

This is basically a routine horror movie made mostly to cash in on the success of the first film , with not too much interest in the characters or story . Fairly scary , but the original was better . Special effects are good , performances acceptable ( although Jesse is something of a wimp - you usually don't hear any male scream as much as he does ) .

I admit upfront a bias , as , like the artist who is the focus of the piece , I have Cerebral Palsy . Although I walk with crutches and my speech is clearer than his , much of what he says and much of his experience in lfe is similar to my own and , I suspect , for many of those who are disabled as well . Although much is made of his disability , much is also made of his art as well and they didn't try to treat him as though he were a dancing bear . It's a powerful affecting film and it haunts me still and will for the rest of my days . It is difficult to be disabled and I'm not talking about physical barriers , but rather the preconceptions people in general have about the disabled .

I am purposely leaving his name out because his story is the story of so many that it does what every artist tries to do at one time or another-create an Everyman .

388,"Text1: It took me that long to finally watch Factory Girl , a story which tells of a wealthy party girl , a poor little rich kid's trials and tribulations , her parties and the friends she keeps , her influences and vices ranging from hard drinking to drug taking . No , it's not about Paris Hilton ( you can wager some money that one will be out in future ) , but probably a precursor to her , a woman called Edie Sedgwick , who lived and died hard and fast . It's not the first time where we have rich young girls choosing a totally different career path for herself , the other in recent memory being Domino Harvey , played by Keira Knightley in Domino . Sienna Miller has an uncanny facial resemblance to the real Edie Sedgwick , and hence an almost automatic choice in taking on the character . This movie brings us on a journey of her very short life , having passed away before reaching 30 years of age . We see the wrong choices she makes in life , her clueless attitude in coasting along with her drug addiction and decadent celebrity lifestyle , having been brought about Superstardom by the famous Andy Warhol ( an almost unrecognizable Guy Pearce ) through his casting her in his avant garde movies , and constant media praising . The factory in Factory Girl refers to Andy Warhol's studio , a warehouse where he lets his creativity run free . Akin to Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion if I may say , where you see plenty of leeches doing what they do best , and that's to kiss Warhol's rear . In some ways , Factory Girl examines how Warhol has a huge impact to Sedgwick's life , her being his muse , and frequently seen and photographed together . But the portrayal here makes him look very much a pompous prick who has problems with his own sexuality , though adopting a very protective attitude towards his exploited creations , nary sharing his wealth with his posse , who are probably satisfied with licking up the crumbs that get fallen off the table . But the more peculiar bit of casting and characterization , is that of Hayden Christensen's "" Musician "" , an amalgamation of boyfriends that Sedgwick has , but implicitly , and quite obviously through the make up and costumes , that Bob Dylan's the one being referred to here . While we see how the clash of egos between Warhol and Musician comes to drastically affect Sedgwick's life , the movie didn't evoke any sense of pity on Sedgwick , and more often than not , makes us feel that she deserves whatever punishment that Life is dishing out to her . The presentation styles adopted in this movie by George Hickenlooper were pretty mixed , constantly shifting visual techniques from documentary styled interviews , to the incorporation of remade avant garde movies , from colour to black and white . While the focus is supposed to be on Edie Sedgwick given the title , in reality , Andy Warhol as a character gets to share just about as much spotlight , probably because he's the more famous of the two , and Guy Pearce looks like a carbon copy of the real deal , taking a leaf out of Philip Seymour Hoffman's playing of Truman Capote , only with an increased amount of meanness . When the end credits rolled , interviews with real friends and relatives tell us a little bit more on Edie , but I felt it was too little too late , that the movie itself squandered this opportunity to tell a more compelling narration of her life . Instead , those interested in more would probably hit Wikipedia and do some reading up on Andy Warhol , and Edie Sedgwick .

Text2: Push is one of those movies that gives you the deja-vu feeling that it's a quick hack job , because from the trailer alone , images of X-men as well as Star Wars come racing through your mind , what with talk about being born with special powers akin to being a mutant wanted by government agents , as well as in execution of those abilities as fluidly like a Jedi Knight would , with mind-tricks , Force Push and a prophecy to fulfil . It takes place in today's world , where some folks get to be born with powers that The Division ( aka the Dark Side ) classifies into broad terms like Pushers , Movers , Watchers , Sniffs , Shadows , Shifters , Wipers and Bleeders . Naturally there are good and bad guys within those classes , and The Division are a select few who have government backing to operate like Nazis and conduct experiments to make them all stronger , for weaponization ( yes , the DNA of the USA is to weaponize everything ) . The good guys though are not organized and are forever on the run from The Division , until a few of them decide to band together and fight for their rights . At least that would be a tad more interesting . Instead , we get a grouping of half-past-six heroes who have idled their potential and not honed it to perfection . Chris Evans ' Nick Gant is a drifter who spends his time trying to hone his powers to win in illegal street gambling . He's a mover , and one day gets found out by Dakota Fanning's Watcher just because she sees him in her hallucinatory state from the impressionistic pictures she constantly draws on a sketch pad . A lotus prophecy ( it's set in Hong Kong you see ) tells this second-generation power couple to band together in their common quest to find Kira Hudson ( Camilla Belle ) , a one time ex-flame of Nick's , and a mysterious briefcase , where by their powers and artifacts combine , they can bring down The Division , kinda like a solo shot in the dark to blow up the Death Star . Only that the promise doesn't actually get delivered because Push decided to dwell a lot on the bickering and planning stage , while leaving the intended finale either forgotten conveniently , or set aside for a straight to DVD sequel . So what makes this interesting ? Apparently I got my kicks out of watching the characters here struggle with their Cantonese . And as an action movie , it sure does have its moments , especially with that street-fighter enhanced fistfight between Nick Gant and what could possibly be The Division's most powerful Mover / Grunt Victor ( Neil Jackson ) . Djimon Hounsou plays the meanest badass in the movie with Push powers , able to command the weakest of minds ( read : supporting characters ) to do his bidding . His Henry Carver came across as a poor man's Samuel L . Jackson , and only SLJ can do what SLJ does best - be a mofo . Camilla Belle got wasted here as a damsel in distress , exhibiting some surprise moves once in a while ( and even that had implanted doubts ) , but generally nothing more than a flower vase . Dakota Fanning isn't new to the action movie genre since she had her firm grounding learning from Tom Cruise on how to run with fear ( thanks to War of the Worlds ) . I admire the now teenager in trying to put into good use her acting chops here , but the filmmakers decided to make her Cassie Holmes suffer a bad hair day throughout . Also , this film had exposed one of her flaws - while she's a good actress and all , she cannot play intoxicated ( teenage drinking to boost powers , hooray ) . Her drunkenness was one of the most unconvincing I've seen put on screen , and she too nearly wanted to break into laughter at her inability . Filmed entirely in Hong Kong , I caught glimpse from the end credits that Johnnie To and Milkyway got credited for the production . I guess if you want to film Hong Kong in a certain style , there's only the current Hot Property to turn to for consultation . Also , DOP Peter Sova had some very obvious use of the fish-eye lens that seem to mimic that of Christopher Doyle's in Fallen Angels . Most of the Chinese characters here are pretty weak , and not to mention unintentionally hilarious as well , with their shout-down powers of Pop Boy 1 ( Chi Kwan Fung ) and 2 ( Jacky Heung ) and a far superior Watcher ( Lu Lu ) trying to gain a one up against The Division through triad-styled turf wars . The plot might seem a little muddled as it tried hard to sound intelligent , and there are some illogical moments with characters popping up and about , coupled with some really tired and uninspiring lines and unclear character motivation . Not that it was an unentertaining film , it actually is . However , it's a movie purely for escapism purposes , this might just be a quick fix to your X-men addiction , if you look too much into it that you see the glaring loopholes that is .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

390,"Text1: I liked this movie quite a bit , and seeing how lowly it is scored here I have to say , crap why couldn't I hate it instead . Granted I did buy it and I would hate to own a movie that isn't horror that I don't care for , but man I know everyone here will think less of me now . So be it , I thought this was a very fast paced ultra cool thrill ride . It has loads of action at the front of the movie and the end , the middle is filled with plot devices and more spread apart action . The movie reminded me of two other sci-fi action movies that didn't do all that well at the box office either "" Freejack "" and "" Johnny Mneumonic "" and throw in some "" Blade "" and "" Resident Evil "" and there ya go . Milla was great in this movie , well to me anyway and I loved the action and the guns and the sword fighting . The plot has a world with people who are normal and those infected with a type of vampirism . Our hero has this disease and it makes her a serious butt kicker . She is on a mission at the beginning to retrieve a mysterious package , and this expands to her protecting a mysterious boy who may have a cure for the disease or he may just kill all the vampires . Like I said lot of action ensues . . . and Milla is just to hot in this one and I love her every changing clothes , her every changing really tight clothes . Man she has a very sexy mid section . Well anyways , I would read other reviews before deciding to see this one , because I am in the minority in really enjoying this one , however I will say give it a chance . It isn't anything original or groundbreaking , but it is rather fast paced and was not boring .

Text2: This is one of my favorite horror movie anthologies . All five stories are pretty good ; some of course are better than others . This one is also a lot better than Creepshow 2 , which had only one really good story to it . The first story is an ok story involving this old man killed by his daughter . He comes back to life expecting a cake cause its father's day . Nothing to surprising happens here , but it is still pretty fun . The next one involves the story that has Stephen King as the main star . This is probably the weakest one of the five , but it is worth a chuckle or two as King does a somewhat good job of playing a slow fellow . This story involves a meteor that makes grass grow everywhere . The next story is one of the best , a revenge tale with Ted Danson and Leslie Nielson . Danson has been having an affair with Nielson's wife so Nielson takes him to the beach and buries him up to his neck in the sand . He had done the same thing with his wife and the tide apparently kills them both . . . or does it ? The next tale is rather good as well as it has Adriean Barbeau in it as this obnoxious wife . Her husband finds out about a crate that may take care of her though . And the final tale is about a doctor or something , who is a bit of a clean freak . He lives in a special apartment that is supposed to be germ free , but it apparently has a roach problem . I don't even think he is a doctor , but he seems to be wearing a doctor's clothes .

391,"Text1: In the wake of Wes Craven's phenomenally successful SCREAM there was an army of cash-in clones that emerged and , sad to say , I was one of those who went and watched a slew of them at the multiplexes . This revisit dredged up all those bad memories of disappointments . Director John Ottman ( . . who seems to be a jack-of-all-trades , but he wisely decided to compose music instead ) and writer Paul Harris Boardman set the film within the trappings of college film-making referencing movies and having characters running around sets getting killed by a masked psycho wearing all black ( . . I think that's a fencing mask he was wearing , not sure what that was for , but oh well ) . URBAN LEGENDS : FINAL CUT follows the formula of characters stalked one-by-one , all members of Amy Mayfield's ( Jennifer Morrison ) crew . There's a link , of course , and it's a irksome twist which leaves a sour taste . It's hard enough sitting through lamely executed death sequences which lack any potency whatsoever , but to endure the final climactic revelation ( . . which deals with Amy's deceased Documentarian father , yawn ) just adds an extra kick to the groin . Good news is Morrison would move on to the popular television show HOUSE , and has blossomed into a lovely woman , and good actress . She's not bad as the lead , but her character is a direct model to the established Neve Campbell final girl which would populate the resurgent post-1996 contemporary slasher for years to come . Amy is often alone and fleeing from a determined pursuer , narrowly escaping . There are red herrings in the form of Trevor Stark ( Matthew Davis , who was in EVERYTHING at this point and time ) , the twin brother of a slain talented college filmmaker , and Toby ( Anson Mount ) , a Director of Photography who so desires to win the prestigious Hitchcock award that he walks out on Amy out of contempt for her "" intruding into his genre "" . Trevor solidifies himself as the worst protector ever in a slasher as Amy can never depend on him to be there for her when she's being chased by the maniac ( . . it's obviously designed to cast doubt on Trevor ) . Amy's film-making project is to film a series of Urban Legends , a horror movie consisting of grisly vignettes but her crew are getting killed , not showing up to the set the next day . Soon she is the target until the typical ending featuring the room of suspects , a killer's identity uncovered and the scramble for a weapon . Hart Bochner ( Terror Train ) is a hip bit of casting as a film school scholar , Professor Solomon , and Loretta Devine returns from the first film as a college security guard , Reese Wilson ( . . such a welcome presence in a movie that doesn't deserve such a vibrant personality ) . Joey Lawrence even stops by as Graham , a student with a wealthy father who has connections into the industry . . this would be one of MANY clunkers for "" Joseph "" after BLOSSOM . Eva Mendes has a thankless role as a lesbian assistant to Amy , Vanessa . . far from the sultry tasty dish she'd soon become . The opening kill-scene packs a punch ( . . concerning an actress who is drugged , finding herself in a ratty apartment buried under ice , her kidney removed , attempting to escape , her stitched womb pried open by the killer before using a broken window glass to behead her ) but the subsequent murders leave much to be desired . Other recognizable faces include Anthony Anderson as a make-up effects wiz and Jessica Cauffiel as a really terrible actress , who couldn't even scream effectively . Rebecca Gayheart ( . . the psycho from the first film ) has a cameo at the end as a special wink to URBAN LEGENDS . Very similar to SCREAM 3 , and certainly not as entertaining or clever . Unfortunately , an even worse sequel ( . . how could that be possible ? ) would come much later , BLOODY MARY .

Text2: I seem to be in the minority regarding this Dracula feature which I think is satirical in many ways . Think about it . . England's finest worshipping Satan , following the leadership of Count Dracula for ultimate mad power . The idea that Dracula has moved up the corporate ladder , a powerful businessman who has his own corporation , and a criminal organization planning to threaten global catastrophe by way of a newly created Bubonic plague . Lee even speaking Hungarian ( ! ) , obviously paying homage to Lugosi , using an alias , DD Dunham to carry out his underhanded dastardly deeds . Unlike other films , Dracula only bites one female victim in this one , threatening the life of Lorrimer Van Helsing's daughter ( . . this time played by stunning Joanna Lumley ) who are together working with detectives to infiltrate a den of vampires , led by Dracula . There's a great use of a hawthorn bush ( . . from such a bush was the crown of thorns placed on Christ's head which is why such a thing can inflict harm to the Devil's disciple ) to weaken Dracula . There's a place of Satan worship where Dracula's agents and disciples use for their amoral activities with a cellar containing his "" brides . "" You have Gibson's exciting camera-work , some nicely vicious stake-in-the-heart stabbings , and , while a bit dated , it's not a kooky as the previous Gibson vehicle , actually incorporating spy elements . . Dracula is kind of like a Bond villain with Cushing infiltrating his organization . Check it out if you would like to see a different type of Hammer Dracula movie . Includes a bit of nudity as a disciple of Dracula lays upon a table naked as kind of a sacrificial lamb as English political giants grin lasciviously at the idea of attaining global power and eternal life thanks to their new master . It seems Hammer fans resist Dracula in modern London , but , like the previous film Dracula AD 1972 , the vampire rarely circulates with society , using others to assist him in his activities . I think the office meeting between Lee and Cushing hearkens wonderfully back to Horror of Dracula and the we see a fabulous dissolve sequence at the end where a murdered vampire deteriorates before our eyes , from the flesh withering into bones , finally turning the remains into dust . To be honest , unlike others , I didn't mind the film not explaining how Dracula returns . I think , like previous films have shown , someone used blood or something to resurrect him . Look , films in the past came up with far-fetched , but imaginative , ways to bring him back to life and dispatch Dracula again , so not displaying his resurrection this time perhaps saves haters from rolling their eyes in disbelief .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

393,"Text1: I have to give ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST a decidedly mixed review . Before I begin , let me point to the major flaws involved : the dialog is not as sharp as in the Clint Eastwood westerns Sergio directed ; the score is not quite as electrifying as those memorable background scores featured in the Eastwood flicks ; and there is never enough exposition in the dialog to fill the viewer in with any background information nor is there any insight into the character motivations of CHARLES BRONSON . You have to wait until the last ten minutes of the two hours and forty-six minutes running time to discover why Bronson has been trailing the villainous HENRY FONDA . Aside from these annoying defects , the convoluted storyline does manage to hold the attention from the opening shots before the credits , consisting mostly of close-ups of WOODY STRODE and JACK ELAM as they await the arrival of a transcontinental train . The story is only vaguely made comprehensible by the time CLAUDIA CARNIVALE arrives to greet her new husband and his children - - only to find that they have all been slaughtered . From then on , the tension never lets up , although it is drawn out interminably with scenes that never seem to move but have impact because of the clever editing . It's certainly a western saga and obviously cost a pretty penny to produce . The atmosphere seems authentic as to the sets and costumes and there is a distinct lack of a Hollywood touch to the gunplay and violence . But is it a great western ? I would have preferred a less enigmatic approach to the storyline - - but the strength of the film lies in the solid performances from an excellent cast . I would have liked a little more from Claudia Carnivale than a fixed stare , which she seems to substitute for an intense overall performance . However , JASON ROBARDS , JR . does an impressive job as the outlaw "" Cheyenne "" . The final shootout between Bronson and Fonda is masterfully shot and within the time it takes place we're also given a flashback that shows why Bronson was tracking down Fonda's character . But the film's pace is much too slow and not exactly enlivened by a lack of dialog . And finally , I was disappointed that Morricone's score lacked the excitement of those he did for other "" spaghetti westerns "" .

Text2: So many high quality prison melodramas have been on the screen in the last few decades that this one - - made in 1930 - - has to be reviewed in the context of its time . As such , it's a well-written , powerful study of men behind bars , none of whom observes a code of conduct likely to make them good material for rehabilitation . CHESTER MORRIS is a forger , WALLACE BEERY is a thick-necked bullying murderer and ROBERT MONTGOMERY is a comparative "" innocent "" with a drunken manslaughter charge against him . They share the same cell and are soon involved in bickering and double-crosses that make up most of the plot contrivances that lead to a prison break where all hell breaks loose . Within the conventions of crime melodramas , this one maintains passable interest today although it lacks the taut tension of more modern prison dramas . Filmed when sound in film was only two years old , there is virtually no background music at all - - a factor which dates the film's style and gives it a static quality during moments where music would have raised the drama to a higher pitch . CHESTER MORRIS , an interesting actor , is likable and energetic as the man who walks out of prison a free man after helping to contain the riot . ROBERT MONTGOMERY does a fine job as the coward who breaks under the stress of having betrayed another prisoner and LEWIS STONE does a good turn as the warden . Overall , it's better than average for this sort of thing - - well paced despite the lack of background music to emphasize the drama - - and worth watching for the performances . Beery is especially good and deserved his Best Actor nomination . Chester Morris is equally impressive in the top-billed assignment , forceful and convincing all the way in a showy role . But I have to conclude that Warner Bros . seemed to have a better handle than MGM on this sort of tough , stark material . Raoul Walsh's WHITE HEAT ( ' 49 ) with James Cagney is the best example .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He was nominated for an Oscar and BAFTA , but he did win a Golden Globe for his extraordinary performance of a man who spent all his life at home not reading , not writing , having meals made for him , and all his learning comes from television . He also has a keen interest in gardening , which is what confuses people to believe his surname is Gardiner . Basically when going out of the house , for once , Chance is injured by a car belonging to Eve Rand ( BAFTA nominated Shirley MacLaine ) , daughter of dying Benjamin Turnbull Rand ( Melvyn Douglas in his second Oscar winning role , also won a Golden Globe ) . He lives with this family and immediately has people talking about how considerate and understanding he is , but he obviously hardly has a clue what's going on . He even meets the United States President , ' Bobby ' ( Jack Warden ) in the process . Also starring Richard A . Dysart as Dr . Robert Allenby .

396,"Text1: It is no secret that Charlie Chaplin spent most of his first year in film-making churning out simple short comedies for Keystone Studios , in which he spent most of his time either kicking , punching , and throwing bricks at people or planting kisses on uncomfortable women . Laffing Gas is kind of a cross section of Chaplin's first year in film because it has all of those elements , as well as about the same ending as most of the other Keystone films , but it also shows a lot of Chaplin's most brilliant talents , the tricks that he does with his body and his cane and his hat . Also , I am not sure if it was just the copy that I watched , but part of the film plays in regular motion , rather than the slightly fast motion of most of the other short films , so you can see pretty clearly what it actually looked like when they were filming the fight scenes . Early in the film , Charlie walks into the dentist's office where he works and immediately has a fistfight with another guy , the receptionist , I guess , in the office . And this guy is tiny , by the way . Chaplin was a little guy himself , but this other guy makes Chaplin look like a giant . Anyway , they have a fight scene that is in normal speed , so it almost looks like slow-motion . The film is also one of the more violent of the Keystone films ; at one point a guy gets hit in the face with a brick and then seems to spit out some teeth , soon landing himself in the dentist's office and being worked on by Charlie , who threw the brick in the first place , with a pair of what looks like bolt-cutters . There is a brief use of laughing gas in the film , but most of it is another ten minute slapstick fight scene interspersed with some genuinely brilliant moments . Also note that one scene in the film is filmed on the sidewalk in front of a place called the Sunset Pharmacy , which I imagine was a real place somewhere on Sunset Blvd . in Los Angeles . If anyone knows anything about that , please let me know !

Text2: Many would argue that with part II the Species films had already reached a sufficiently abysmal quality level as to deserve to go straight to video . There was , however , too much money spent on the first sequel and too much interest in the series still left over from the 1st film for this to be an option , but with part III there are no theatrical shenanigans in sight . Species III is a direct to video mess from start to finish . It was hard enough to believe in Species II that they made a clone of Sil , but I suppose it can be believed since the scientists wanted to study her for weaknesses that could be used in case another outbreak of aliens occurred . So in the original film , Sil was created , escaped promptly and went looking for a mate . She was a vicious enemy throughout , and her pursuers were desperate to capture and kill her , knowing at least vaguely what she was capable of . In part II they make a clone and keep her in a huge glass cage , which is more like a living room surrounded by thick glass , and complete with everything from a treadmill to a television set . Dr . Baker , the lead scientist , even routinely went inside the cage with her and the two had civilized conversations . In part III there is a male scientist that seems to think that the new Eve , this time named Sara , is his daughter . He even tells her stories as he tucks her into a bed in his house . Part III starts where part II left off , with the fatally wounded Eve being transferred by military ambulance to be disposed of . I like that two low level guys are sent off alone with Eve's body , with not a single other vehicle along to make sure that the transport gets safely to its destination . Needless to say , all hell breaks loose in the form of two babies born from Eve's dead - then - alive - then - dead - again body , after which the movie has no idea where it's supposed to go . At least I assume they were both born in the ambulance , One of them was just kind of there . There is so little effort put into maintaining any linearity to the aliens in this film , since they grow and change so fast , that pretty soon you'll find yourself just accepting that there are a lot of aliens running around trying to mate , as well as lots of half breeds complicating matters further . Our hero may be the dumbest thing about the entire movie , and not by any fault of Robin Dunne , the actor who played him . It seems that Dean is working on a fission reactor , giving a tour of his team's progress at the beginning of the movie , only to rush out and arrive late to class , at which point he is scolded by his idiot professor as if he were in 3rd grade . His professor soon starts fantasizing about viruses , soon becoming furious that someone would be so inconsiderate to plan the destruction of the only remaining smallpox virus still in existence , which is kept contained for studying purposes . Not only does he almost get emotional about a virus , but when Dean points out some of the imperfections of viruses , his professor becomes furious with him once again , and then a student pushes past him outside of class , angrily calling him a "" specist . "" I had no idea that viruses had interest groups . It was nice that Natasha Henstridge made a notable guest appearance at the beginning of the film , although she only served to remind the viewer that no one else but her can play the alien in a Species film . The combined alien and human DNA has once again cooked up some more staggering hotties . Not only does this genetic combination consistently cook up hot blondes , but now breast implants have been added to the blonde and a brunette is thrown in for good measure . Yes , Sunny Mabrey is nice enough to bare her plastic breasts for much of her screen time . The brunette alien , who appears in the film out of nowhere , has a quick and wildly unsexy sex scene with a gas station attendant before speeding off in her $140 , 000 Ferrari , leaving a skewered carcass and the rest of the gas station employees just as clueless as us in the audience . Amelia Cooke , who plays the brunette alien , does offer a shining moment of interest well into the fourth half hour of this film and after an hour and a half of slogging through a lot of pus-filled , gooey sci-fi crap . This movie is so bad and so unforgivably long , however , that even her relatively shining performance has a hard time rising above the slop in which it is mired .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

398,"Text1: ' The Unknown Guest ' is a German comedy film . I'm tempted to make a cheap joke that the phrase ' German comedy ' is an oxymoron . . . and , indeed , much of the knockabout slapstick in this film is merely embarrassing . But in fact there is some genuine humour here in this by-the-numbers farce , supplied by the comedy skills of one beloved character actor and an unjustly obscure character actress . Harry Hardt and Anni Markart play a wealthy couple , whose urban household employs many servants . As is typical in such houses ( and not merely in Germany ) , there is a rigid status system among the servants : the lowliest among them is the chambermaid ( Lucie Englisch ) who is married to the household's chauffeur ( Hans Brausewetter ) . The chambermaid came to the city from a Bavarian village ; her husband has never met her relatives . At the top of the food chain in the servants ' quarters is the brawny battle-axe housekeeper ( Senta Söneland ) . During her employment , the maid has frequently sent letters home to her widowed father ( from this address ) but has never told him that she is employed as a maidservant . The master and mistress of the house go away on holiday , but they inform the servants that the master's rich father ( also a widower ) will be coming to visit in their absence . Naturally , he is to be given every possible hospitality and consideration . Shortly after the mistress and her husband depart , along comes a stout respectable-looking man . But he isn't the master's rich father : he's actually the father of the chambermaid . This very posh house is his daughter's address , so he assumes that she's the mistress here . And all the other servants assume that the maid's father is the expected wealthy visitor . The maidservant sees no reason to disabuse anyone of their errors : she contrives to masquerade as the mistress of the household ( to impress her father ) whilst convincing her husband and her fellow servants that her provincial father is actually the wealthy father-in-law of the household's true mistress . Naturally , there are no end of farcical complications . The heavy-set unattractive housekeeper tries to vamp the ' wealthy ' houseguest , not realising who he really is . . . and that he has no money . Senta Söneland gives a deft performance as the housekeeper , who pursues her romantic objective with the same brisk efficiency she applies to her household duties . Despite her evident talent as an actress , Söneland was a very unattractive woman who had serious health problems ; she committed suicide a few years after this movie was made . Her performance in this film reminds me of the American character actresses Minerva Urecal and Marjorie Main ( neither of whom I ever liked ) ; Söneland is similar to both of them yet more talented than either . By far , the standout performance in this film is given by the actor who plays the chambermaid's father : none other than Szöke Szakall , the Hungarian Jewish character actor who later fled Europe ( one step ahead of the Nazis ) and had a fondly-remembered career in Hollywood under the name S . Z . Sakall in films such as ' Yankee Doodle Dandy ' and ' Casablanca ' . In ' The Unknown Guest ' , Sakall demonstrates many of the little physical crotchets that would stand him in such excellent stead during his Hollywood years . He shakes his jowls , clutches his face , wipes his brow while muttering desperately . What a delightful piece of Hungarian ham ! ( Although , in deference to Sakall's religion , perhaps ' ham ' is not the best word for him . ) I wish that someone could explain something for me . Many reference books refer to S . Z . Sakall as ' Cuddles ' Sakall , claiming that he was billed by this nickname in some of his Hollywood films . I've seen several of Sakall's American films , yet I've never seen one in which this fine actor is billed as ' Cuddles ' . Can someone please either verify this rumour or end it once for all ? I'll rate ' The Unknown Guest ' , for the fine performance of Szöke Szakall and for the splendid support by Senta Söneland .

Text2: I saw ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' at the Pordenone silent-film festival in Sacile , Italy , in 2006 . The print that was screened for us had a surprise bonus : at some point in its history ( presumably during its original release , while William Howard Taft was President of the U . S . A . ) the starting leader had broken off the print , and some projectionist had replaced it by splicing in several feet of newsreel footage showing President Taft . The programmers at the Pordenone festival decided to keep this in , and I'm glad they did . I well and truly had a sense of watching this film as it was exhibited in 1911 . . . in the rough and ready days when , if a film broke , you did whatever was necessary to keep the show going ! ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' is a shortened version of James Herne's 1893 stage melodrama ' Shore Acres ' , radically abridged and revised as a star vehicle for Mary Pickford . ' Shore Acres ' was hugely popular in its day , and controversial with it . . . largely due to the fact that one character was ( gasp ! ) an atheist who spoke the earth-shaking ( in those days ) line "" He said he'd see me in Hell first . "" ( That line and the character who spoke it are absent from this version . ) Herne's play was a perennial favourite for about 20 years , but is now painfully dated . ( Buster Keaton and his father were lampooning ' Shore Acres ' in their vaudeville turn , circa 1905 . ) Several of the scenes in this melodrama do not work well on stage , notably the climax in a fishing boat in a storm at sea during a dark night : this film version benefits from being able to open up such scenes . Pickford plays Polly Berry , daughter of the old lighthouse keeper Nat Berry ( J . Farrell MacDonald , excellent as always ) . Two local youths , noble Tom Atkins ( John Harvey ) and rakehell Bert Duncan ( William E . Shay ) , are rivals for Polly's affection . When Tom earns her favour , Bert darkly vows revenge and then skulks off into the canebrakes . Later , Polly and Tom are incautious enough to be in a fishing boat at sea while a storm brews . Their only hope of safely reaching shore depends on the lighthouse's faithful beacon . Bert , in a drunken rage , climbs into the lighthouse and tries to put out the light . He and Nat Berry scuffle . ( Although this scene is heavily rewritten , it retains the climactic fistfight from the original play . ) SPOILERS COMING NOW . Although much older and less fit than the drunken Bert , cold sober Nat Berry manages to defeat him and keep the lamp lighted . Bert wanders off into the surf . Come morning , the storm has passed : Polly and Tom are safely home , while Bert's bloated corpse washes up on the rocks . By far the best thing in this creaky mellerdrammer is Mary Pickford's performance . Age 19 at the time , she is ( for once ) exactly the right age for the role she is playing . There is just a hint of Pickford's "" Little Mary "" in her portrayal of a young woman who is sexually mature yet emotionally innocent , with a touch of Grace Darling at the film's climax . Character actor J . Farrell MacDonald had a long film career , yet is now completely forgotten except by die-hard film fans : his stalwart performance is likewise an asset to this film , which otherwise tips over dangerously into the laughable territory of morality plays . As for the performances of the actors playing the rivals Tom and Bert . . . well , there's a reason why they languish in obscurity . More happily , there's a wedding scene in which I briefly spotted actor Hayward Mack and Mary's sister Lottie Pickford . IMDb's web page for ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' says that this film was shown aboard the Titanic , three nights before the fateful Night to Remember . I've never heard this rumour from any other source , and I've no idea whether or not it's true . If so , it's deeply ironic , as the climax of ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' depicts two people struggling to survive in a small craft at sea on a dark night . No icebergs , though . . . nor even iceberg lettuce . I'll rate ' The Lighthouse Keeper ' .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
399,"Text1: SPOILERS Re-made Raymond Chandler film-noir classic that just doesn't have the drama and suspense of the original Bogart / Bacall 1946 film that in some ways was even more confusing then the less effective 1978 remake . We have in this version of "" The Big Sleep "" Robert Mitchum as the not so usual down on his luck , barley keeping up with paying the rent for his shabby office , private detective Philip Marlow . Marlow drives around in a $50 , 000 . 00 car checking the time on his $5 , 000 . 00 Rollex watch and wearing clothes personally tailored and cut to size never getting dirty torn or even creased no matter how many beatings he take throughout the movie ! This time around Philip Marlow is working his trade , as a PI , in the green rolling countryside of the 1970's jolly old England not the dark dirty and gritty streets of 1940's L . A . Coming to see his latest client sick and disabled millionaire General Sternwood , James Stewart , Marlow is told that he's being blackmailed by this local bookstore owner Arthur Geiger , John Justin . Geiger has a number of nude photos of General Sternwood's wacky's younger daughter Camilla , Candy Clark , and is threatening to make them public if the General doesn't pay him 10 , 000 Pound Sterling . We , and Philip Marlow , see right away that Camilla is a bit off her rocker but what we don't realize is that General Sternwood is really interested in finding her missing husband Rusty Regan , David Seville , whom he seems to have become very found of in his stories about himself and his exploits as an Irish patriot . Besides Camilla there's also the Generals slightly nymphomaniac older daughter Charlotte , Sara Miles , who like the younger Carmilla is always making a play for the much older , and not at all interested , Philip Marlow that's keeping him from doing his job . Marlow tries to track down Geiger and finds him in his house , with a naked and goofy Carmilla , shot dead between the eyes . It's later found out that the Sternwood family chauffeur Owen Taylor , Martin Potter , killed Geiger in a fit of anger when he found out that he was photographing his secret lover Carmilla in the nude . It's later that Taylor is himself killed and , together with his car , thrown into the nearby river by an associate of Geiger Joe Brody , Edward Fox . Fox murdered Taylor in order to steal Geiger's film that Taylor had on him but at the same time not knowing that Geiger was already dead . The story leads into a number of different directions that has to do with a local British mobster Eddie Mars , Oliver Reed , and his club-footed and sadistic hit-man known as the Brown Man Lush Canino , Richard Boone , and members of London's sleazy and dangerous Red Light district that includes some of the late Arthur Geiger's gay lovers . All this shenanigans leaves some half dozen corpses behind in it's wake but the real crux of the story goes right back to the missing son-in-law of General Sternwood Rusty Regan . Philip Marlow sensed right from the beginning that General Sternwood was only interested in Rusty's disappearance not his daughter , and Rusty's wife , Carmilla being blackmailed . Wanting to know for himself as well as his client , General Sternwood , if Rusty is either alive or dead Marlow begins to realizes that only Carmilla can provide that answer . Being mentally unbalanced may very well be the result of what Carmilla knows about Rusty . Taking a chance Marlow sets Carmilla up , in a scheme that he secretly devised , in order to find out just what she not only knows about her missing husbands whereabouts but also if she had something to do with his disappearance in the first place . Marlow's scheme entrapping Carmilla and finding out about what happened to Rusty Regan sadly pays off and shocking proves what Philip Marlow suspected about Carmilla all along . Now Marlow has to somehow keep her father General Sternwood from finding it out in order not just to keep from breaking his heart but also from causing him to suffer a fatal heart-attack . Having solved the case of the missing son-in-law for General Sternwood and not even asking or accepting a tip or bonus for doing it , from a grateful Charlotte , Philip Marlow hops in his expensive car and drives as fast as he can out of Sternwood Manor . Marlow in his speedy exit breaks a number of speed limits on the way out as he tries to get his head back together after what he had to go through in solving the case .

Text2: ( There are Spoilers ) Traveling all the way from Boston to see his future wife , whom he met and fell in love with back in Beantnown , the beautiful Madeline Usher , Myrna Fahey , Philip Wintdrop , Mark Damon , is struck by how unnerving the place , The House of Usher , that Medeline lives in is . Meeting the butler Bristol , Harry Ellerbe , at the door Philip is told to get as far away from Madeline and the House of Usher if he knows what's good for him . Refusing not to leave without taking Madeline with him Philip is then confronted by her pasty faced brother , some 20 years Madelines senior , the anemic-looking and accident prone Roderick , Vincent Price . Roderick trying to be as civil as possible tells an outraged Philip that Madeine as well as himself are not long for this world together with the house that they live in "" The House of Usher "" . The film then turns out to be a struggle between Philip and Roderick over Madeline . Philip want's Madeline to leave for Boston with him and Rodrick want her to stay with him in the mansion . It takes a while for the lovesick Philip to realize what's really behind Roberick's obsession in keeping Madeline from leaving him and thus suffer , by being a lost and tortured soul in the outside world , a fate worse then death itself and it has to do with the Usher descendants , which Roderick and Madeline are the only two left . The Usher clan over the last two centuries was made up , for the most part , of scalawags pirates and murders with a few slave dealers thrown in for good measure . The crimes that the Ushers committed against mankind are now about to be avenged and there's nothing that anyone , including Philip Wintrop , can do to stop it . Spectacular final , with cartoon-like 1960 special effects , has the House of Usher go up in flames when the evil that it represents is put to the torch and plowed underground from above and beyond . Philip blinded by his love for Madeline was just too bind to see what was all around him in the evil House of Usher and it was that revelation , at the very end to the movie , that brought him back to his senses . "" House of Usher "" is the movie that really established Roger Corman as a major director of highly successful low-budget films and thus opened the door for him and actor Vincent Price to collaborated in some half dozen low budget horror classics over the next five years . The movie also revived the publics interest in the writings of 19th century American author Edgar Allen Poe . It fact most , if not all , of the films that Roger Corman did together with Vincent Price were in one way or another based on Edgar Allen Poe short stories .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
400,"Text1:  Secretary  is a deliciously off-beat dramedy about an emotionally disturbed young girl ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ) who gets a job as a you know what for an attorney with his own set of personal problems ( James Spader ) . Soon , she's doing more than typing for him , and he's helping her come out of her reclusive shell . This film on paper sounds almost exactly like "" The Piano . "" A young woman is given the choice between a conventional relationship and one that superficially might seem perverse , and opts for the perverse one . In both films , what no-one in the heroine's sphere understands is that the man she's involved with is appealing because he's the only one who seems to understand what she needs . "" Secretary "" is not as sombre as "" The Piano , "" however , though it's not as rowdy as the premise might lead you to believe . It's actually a quite substantive film and only occasionally did I think it faltered somewhat in telling its story ( particularly toward the end , when Lee embarks upon her hunger strike ) . Ironically , in offering herself up for submissive humiliation from her boss , Lee finds the strength she needs to face her own demons and forges a confidence she's never before had . Gyllenhall is spectacular , and gives one of those performances that should put her on the map as a serious actress , if anyone is paying attention . Spader is pretty good too , but he's upstaged by Gyllenhaal , who owns this movie .

Text2: I wish I had seen the original Broadway production of Camelot . As a lad the Broadway cast album was a treasured staple in our house , played over and over again by my parents . Can you imagine a cast led by Richard Burton , Julie Andrews and introducing Robert Goulet as Lancelot ? So why couldn't Warner Brothers sign the original cast from Broadway for the movie ? Robert Goulet had in fact come to Hollywood and didn't set the world on fire , but the other two were already big box office names by 1967 . Julie Andrews had won an Oscar for Mary Poppins and just did the Sound of Music . And Richard Burton was one half of the most noted show business couple of the Sixties with his wife Elizabeth Taylor . Jack Warner , usually a smart guy , said that he didn't think that anyone would believe that two guys like Arthur and Lancelot would put a kingdom at risk for the love of Mary Poppins . So Julie wasn't even asked and Vanessa Redgrave got the call . She's certainly sexy enough , but she opted for the Rex Harrison talk / sing in doing Guinevere . If you have the video or DVD of Camelot play that and then listen to Julie Andrews sing from the original cast album . My favorite song from the score is I Loved You Once In Silence and Julie Andrews is at her best singing that song . Vanessa doesn't come close . Ditto for Richard Burton and Richard Harris . Though in the case of Harris I think he was toning it down a mite for a clearly handicapped co-star in the vocal department . Harris later in his life toured extensively in various productions of Camelot as Arthur , virtually taking over the role originated by his close friend Burton . The biggest hit from the Camelot score was If Ever I Would Leave You , sung by Robert Goulet . In 1961 you couldn't get away from that song being played on the radio right in the midst of all the rock and roll . Goulet also toured in various stock companies of Camelot and like both Burton and Harris revived it on Broadway . I don't think anyone ever asked Franco Nero to tour . But Redgrave and Nero certainly created their own screen magic , they got involved with each other on the set . But folks this is a musical and musically they don't measure up . David Hemmings takes over the role of Mordred from Roddy McDowall who did it on stage . His Mordred is a clever schemer , but a coward as well . For myself the best Mordred ever portrayed on screen was in Knights of the Round Table by Stanley Baker . Baker's interpretation of Mordred is light years from Hemmings , he's a schemer , but he's definitely no coward . I love the score of Camelot and when it was filmed I only wish the singing was half as good as the Broadway show .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

403,"Text1:  It's a Bird It's a Plane It's Superman  was the unwieldy ( and comma-less ) title of a 1966 Broadway musical that ran for less than four months . The score by Charles Strouse and Lee Adams produced not a single hit song . . . although "" You've Got Possibilities "" was recorded in England by Matt Munro . ' Superman ' was such a resounding failure that , years later , when Martin Charnin approached Strouse to write the tunes for a musical comedy about Little Orphan Annie , Strouse almost refused because he'd already had one flop musical about a comic-book character ! ( ' Annie ' became the biggest hit in Strouse's songbook . ) Many bizarre ( or Bizarro ) decisions were made in the musical ' Superman ' , chiefly the decision to eliminate most of the established characters . The Broadway musical has no Perry White , no Jimmy Olsen . ( They show up briefly in this tele-version . ) Superman wastes a lot of time fighting some larcenous Chinese acrobats ( played by white actors ) who seem more like Batman's sort of villains . The main villain here is an evil scientific genius in the tradition of Lex Luthor . . . but he isn't Lex Luthor . Apparently the producers of ' Superman ' didn't want to pay DC Comics for the rights to use the Luthor character , so they named their villain "" Doctor Abner Sedgwick "" . In the Broadway production ( but not in this TV version ) , the actor playing Dr Sedgwick wore long flowing hair , just to make sure we all understood he wasn't the famously chrome-domed Lex Luthor . The lead character in the ' Superman ' musical isn't even Superman , Clark Kent , Lois Lane or anyone else in the established superhero canon : it's Max Mencken ( who ? ) , an egotistical reporter at the Daily Planet who wants to destroy Superman due to sheer envy . Mencken actually has more time onstage than Superman and Clark Kent together ! ( And more songs . ) In 1966 the big-name Broadway actor Jack Cassidy was looking for a star vehicle , so the ' Superman ' production team built up the minor role of Mencken in order to attract Cassidy and take advantage of his box-office name value . This was a fatal error : a musical about Superman ought to be ABOUT Superman . ' ABC Wide World of Entertainment ' wasn't so much a TV series as it was an irregular time slot . In the 1970s , whenever ABC-TV had a piece of programming that didn't fit any established niche , they bunged it into whatever late-night slot was available and called it ' Wide World of Entertainment ' . The most notorious example of this was the ' Monty Python ' special which ABC-TV aired at midnight : several Python episodes were drastically recut to fit the time slot , provoking a famous lawsuit from the Python comedians . The 1975 television production of "" It's a Bird It's a Plane It's Superman "" - - transmitted under ABC's ' Wide World of Entertainment ' rubric - - is a re-staging of the Broadway show , with a new cast . This is a VERY bad musical special , done on a criminally low budget . The entire production is filmed on a cramped sound stage . The musical numbers , which were bad in the first place , are staged in a very unimaginative manner . In the Broadway version , the nearest thing to a hit song was "" You've Got What I Need , Baby "" , a duet sung by Mencken and Sedgwick when they decide to team up in a plot to kill Superman . Staged on Broadway , this was a rousing up-tempo number that efficiently closed the first act . In this 1975 TV version , the song is stodged down so that Kenneth Mars and David Wayne can perform it with arthritic slowness . A ( very minor ) musical high point occurs in the song "" You've Got Possibilities "" when Loretta Swit , as the villainess , attempts to seduce mild-mannered Clark Kent , whom she doesn't realise is really Superman . When Linda Lavin performed this number in the Broadway production , there was an element of suspense when she sang the line "" underneath , there's something there "" while she started to unbutton Clark's shirt . . . nearly discovering the big Superman "" S "" underneath . This clever staging was omitted in the TV version , and nothing better is brought in to replace it . Swit's singing voice is smoky and appropriately vampy , but weak . This TV special does have one poignant moment that didn't occur in the Broadway original , when Superman meets two teenage fans named Jerry and Joe who want to write stories about him and draw pictures of him . This is a subtle reference to Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster , the real-life teenagers from Cleveland who created Superman in the 1930s and sold the character to National Periodical Publications . I wish that "" It's a Bird It's a Plane It's Superman "" had more moments like this . I'll rate this terrible show only . Pass the Kryptonite .

Text2: ' Millionaires in Prison ' is an excellent example of something that doesn't exist anymore , but which was commonplace in the days of the big Hollywood studios : the second feature . In the 1930s and ' 40s , Americans went to the movies expecting to receive a full evening's worth of entertainment : a double feature plus short subjects and a newsreel . The second feature ( which was actually first , as it was screened before the main feature ) typically had a shorter running time , lower budget and more obscure actors and director than the more prestigious main feature . . . but , at their best , the second features were always well-made and solidly entertaining in their own right . ' Millionaires in Prison ' is one of the very best examples of that tradition . The movie opens with a brisk but heavy-handed expository scene , featuring a newspaper editor named R . J . Reynolds . ( Could this be a plug for the tobacco company ? ) Reynolds is giving his reporters an assignment to do a story on four millionaire financiers who have recently been sent to prison for financial shenanigans . Interestingly , the editor tells his reporters in advance precisely how they're supposed to slant their reportage . ( This sort of thing happens all the time in the real world , but I've never seen it depicted in any other movie : in Movieland , reporters are always objective truth-seekers . ) Two of the millionaires , well-played by veteran actors Raymond Walburn and Thurston Hall , are befuddled fall guys who somehow took the rap for someone else's embezzlement . Reynolds tells his reporters ( and us ) that these lads are innocent , and he adds : ' Go easy on them , boys . ' On the other hand , the other two millionaires are outright crooks who are guilty as hell , and Reynolds gleefully tells his newshounds to pull all the stops out on them . Walburn and Hall give enjoyable performances , but the characters they're playing aren't very credible . It's difficult to believe that these two dimwits could ever have been successful financiers . They're in a fairly conventional prison ( not a Club Fed ) , doing hard time , yet they seem to think they're in some sort of country club . There's a nice complement of veteran film faces here , with Lee Tracy and Morgan Conway at their cynical best , and a welcome turn by Shemp Howard .

From there we go to alternating clips of Antonio Banderas asking the ex-bullfighter Nacho Martínez about women and he compares getting a woman to bullfighting , while we watch someone do exactly that . We are no , of course , prepared for the necrophilia twist in that encounter . We find our boy , Antonio , and he is a boy in this film , in a strict Catholic household . I would have to guess that his mother was Opus Dei . He attempts to rape his neighbor and confesses to four murders which we know he did not do . This is just Almodóvar's take on religion and repression . He revisits that subjects again in the film , so it must me a theme for him . But , then the story shifts to Nacho and Assumpta Serna , with Eva Cobo in a minor role . This is where the story gets interesting with the police trying to solve the four murders and the real murderers trying to lay it on Antonio . It gets bizarre at the end with Antonio seeing the killers in his mind and leading the police to them . But , they arrive too late as the climax of sex and death occurs simultaneous with an eclipse . How weird is that ?

Peter Sellers ( Being There , The Pink Panther ) was nominated for another Oscar for playing three roles in this film . He was just outstanding . George C . Scott ( Patton ) was over the top as Gen .

Before you know it , rain is dropping "" zombie pollutants "" into the graveyard soil , releasing the dead from their slumber to wreak havoc in the desperate search for brain consumption . A handful of characters are selected by the screenplay to combat the zombies with a child named Jesse ( Michael Kenworthy ) the protagonist who knows the two neighbor bullies that discovered - - and opened - - the container causing the catastrophic events that ensue . From the previous film , James Karen and Thom Mathews return playing different characters , who were at a mausoleum robbing loot from the dead only to consume the toxic gas changing them slowly into zombies . One of the bullies bothering Jesse , Billy ( Thor Van Lingen ) gets singled out as a possible source of conflict for our heroes later on as he too has breathed in the deadly toxic chemicals from the zombie container . Suzanne Snyder stars as Thom Mathew's girlfriend Brenda . There's an amusing homage to the first film when Mathews has a feeling of deja vu regarding their unfortunate situation . Nowhere near as gruesome as the first film in the series , this sequel follows a much more comedic tone , with Philip Bruns getting supplied the best zingers as Doc Mandel . While the make-up effects for this film are not up to the previous film's standards , they are still fine enough considering the limited budget . The film is really irresistibly silly with the director really using the dead zombies unfortunate situation of decay for lots of comedy bits . The ending is a bit of a stretch - - having our heroes using a power plant as a means to electrocute the zombies - - but the film , I felt , is entertaining enough to hold interest . It could've been much , much worse , and , at least , this has a game cast and fun-loving attitude .

Forrestor himself is infected by the radioactivity when he finds his assistant dead after someone entered his home where the man lay dying while he was out hunting a doctor nearby . In Akasava , Dr .

The soundtrack includes You Do Something To Me , Find me a Primitive Man , You've Got That Thing , and the title song all from the stage production of Fifty Million Frenchmen . This short while it lacks a lot of production values is a marvelous opportunity to see something of a photographed Broadway show of the time . In that it's like The Marx Brothers Cocoanuts or Animal Crackers . Bob Hope was not in the original Broadway cast of Fifty Million Frenchmen , but Cole Porter would provide him with a great duet with Ethel Merman in Hope's last Broadway appearance a few years later in Red , Hot , and Blue . He introduced It's Delovely with her from that show which did lead to his Hollywood contract . Now that would be great if someone preserved them on film singing It's Delovely .

Text2: Career is one no-holds barred look at the theatrical profession and what it takes to get to the top . Anthony Franciosa had that determination , but it cost him big time in his personal life . No pun intended , but this may have been Tony Franciosa's career role . He's Sam Lawson , World War II veteran with thespian ambitions . Franciosa literally starts at the bottom with a character named Maury Novak played by Dean Martin . Career has it all , the performances in fly by night stock companies for indifferent audiences , the fighting for bit roles and the bigger fight to get even noticed for your big break . It costs Franciosa two marriages and near blacklisting through his association with Martin . Career in fact is one of the first films to even mention the blacklist , albeit they do it in a very gingerly way . Had it been made 10 years later , I doubt that the script would have had a line in it for Carolyn Jones to say that the House Un American Activities Committee had some honorable intentions . Speaking of Jones , she's great in a role as an agent who has a deep affection for her client Franciosa . You kind of hope that they will get together at some point in the future . Shirley MacLaine has a great part as the good time daughter of a big theatrical producer played by Robert Middleton . At some point MacLaine gets married to both Franciosa and Martin during the film . Dino did a hit record of the title song for the film although it is only heard instrumentally during the film . His performance as Maury Novak , a sleazy friend indeed to Franciosa , further established him as a dramatic actor and more proof he didn't need Jerry Lewis to succeed .

Only a year after her luminous performance in "" Bonnie and Clyde , "" she had already begun to lose that gauzy feminine glamour ( or maybe she was just lit extremely well in that film ) and acquire that sharper , diamond-jawed and intimidating haughtiness that would make her such a great ball-buster in later films ( and which made her kind of scary as well ) , but she was still knock-out enough to make this film easy enough to sit through .

Text2: Take him or leave him , one can't deny the tremendous screen presence of James Cagney . "" The Public Enemy , "" which launched Cagney into the Hollywood big time , doesn't so much tell one cohesive story as much as it offers a series of vignettes linked by Cagney's sheer star power . Cagney is Tom Powers , childhood hoodlum who grows up to become an adult hoodlum and meets his end as part of a bloody gang war in 1920 Chicago . The film is positioned as part morality tale , part public service message . A title card at the film's opening announces that the filmmakers in no way mean to glamorize the gangster life , while one placed at the end announces a call to action on the part of the American public to bring an end to the seedy underworld portrayed in the movie . And to the film's credit , despite stylish direction by William Wellman and an intensely charismatic performance from Cagney , it sticks to its promise . The film has an invigorating energy , but it never once glamorizes Cagney or his lifestyle . There are a number of truly memorable moments in this film . Of course the famous grapefruit scene has gone down in film annals as one of them , but I was most struck by the film's shocking finale , in which the body of Cagney is dropped off at the front door of his home while his mother happily changes the sheets of his bed upstairs , thinking that "" coming home "" means that her son is coming home alive . Another dazzling segment is the one in which Cagney seeks revenge on the gang that killed his best friend . We see him staking out the pool hall where they have gathered , with a truly frightening and psychotic expression on his face . Then he walks through the rain directly toward the camera until his face fills the frame . After he enters the pool hall , we hear shots and a man screaming while the camera stays focused on the exterior of the building . Cagney then emerges , wounded and staggering through the rain . The whole segment feels much more violent than it actually is , because of the effective use of camera and sound ( which was in its infancy , but which Wellman uses superbly ) . Most of the other actors come off poorly next to Cagney , because his style of acting was so different from the conventions of the time . Donald Cook , playing Cagney's war-hero brother , overacts to the hilt , with one foot firmly planted in silent films . A couple of females are thrown in as eye candy , but absolutely no attempt is made to develop their characters . Joan Blondell is cute and sexy , but Jean Harlow is dreadful . How this ugly , clunking , horrible actress ever achieved stardom is beyond me . And as frequently happens with pre-Code cinema , I was taken aback by material that you never think of appearing in films from this time period . It makes overt fun of gays and Jews , frankly addresses sex , and , most strikingly , makes a parallel between gangsters and soldiers , claiming that both murder but for different reasons . Ten years later a comment like that would NEVER appear in a Hollywood film , and movies wouldn't be comfortable criticizing war again until the 1970s . "" The Public Enemy "" is rough around the edges . You can still feel the various artists involved trying to feel their way around the new era of motion pictures , and as a result , parts of the film are uneven . But it's a striking and remarkable movie that , despite limitations placed on it by the time period and the technology available , packs a gangster-sized punch .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: From director John Frankenheimer ( The Manchurian Candidate [ 1962 ] , Deception ) , this is a wonderful prison drama , worthy of The Shawshank Redemption , with a very admirable leading character played by an actor in his finest role . Based on the true story , prisoner Robert Stroud ( BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Burt Lancaster ) was convicted of murder twice , the second being a prison guard , he was sentenced to life in solitary confinement . One day , while wandering in the prison courtyard , he finds a sickly sparrow and decides to take care of it . He manages to cure it , and trains it to fly , after the new warden , replacing Harvey Shoemaker ( Karl Malden ) allows him to keep the bird , many other prisoners are allowed pet birds too , and as more and more of them are refused by other inmates , Stroud finds a new purpose for life by taking care of and studying these birds ( canaries ) . It is when they all start dying of a mysterious illness that he finds , with help , a new medicine to cure them , and it sparks the interest Stella Johnson ( Betty Field ) who wants to sell it to other bird owners . There is a point when a new appointed warden makes the rule to not allow animals into prison cells , but with the help of Stella , including marriage , which his mother Elizabeth ( Rear Window's Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter ) does not approve of , Stroud makes the front page of the newspaper . He has now become really renowned for his work with birds , i . e . ornithology , and has written a book about it , and he is just the slightest obsessive and eccentric in age as well . This bird hobby is cut short when Stroud is transferred to Alcatraz prison , where they allow no animals whatsoever , and he obviously can't appeal for it , so he is mainly quiet in his prison cell , only writing another book , until a riot threatens the lives of all prisoners , and only Stroud on the speaker to old warden Shoemaker can stop it . In the end , after stopping the Alcatraz riot , he is transferred again to a hospital , but appealing for freedom failed . Also starring Neville Brand as Bull Ransom , Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Telly Savalas as Feto Gomez , Edmond O'Brien as Tom Gaddis ( also narrating ) , Hugh Marlowe as Roy Comstock , Whit Bissell as Dr . Ellis , Crahan Denton as Kramer and James Westerfield as Jess Younger . Apparently Lancaster's portrayal wasn't much like the real man , but his performance was so good for me , I think he should have won the Oscar ( and Golden Globe ) instead of the overrated ( in my opinion ) performance by Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography . Burt Lancaster was number 19 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , and he was number 48 on The World's Greatest Actor , and the film was number 76 on 100 Years , 100 Cheers .

They're just two perfectly photogenic people who happen to be cast in the same less than satisfying romantic mystery - - she has the camera in love with her ( probably the director as well ) and he's still an attractive - - if older - - leading man . That's it . And neither of them can disguise the fact that they're stuck in a glamorous but lightweight Hitchcock film that has the slimmest of plots - - an innocent man is thought to be the one committing the current crimes among the rich on the Riviera - - a man with a past history as a thief . And it's played more for comedy than mystery . And that's it , in a nutshell . Hitchcock seems more concerned that GRACE KELLY is gowned in all of the latest fashions that will look good in Technicolor and that CARY GRANT will look impressive enough as her co-star to make everyone forget the age difference . He rounded up some real pros for a supporting cast , including JOHN WILLIAMS as an urbane detective and JESSIE ROYCE LANDIS as Kelly's mother ( she was Grant's mother in NORTH BY NORTHWEST ) . But it's fluff - - sumptuously mounted fluff and nothing more . Women will sigh over Grace Kelly's many costumes ( even Lana Turner would be envious ) , and men will wish they had a chance to tour the Riviera with Grace as a guide . The suspense is a mere piffle with only one really suspenseful moment on a rooftop with Grant exposing the real culprit - - and the one-liners meant to titillate are almost puerile by comparison with the witticisms in other Hitchcock films of this nature . The accent is more on comedy than thrills and the result is one of the weakest Hitchcock films from this period . Sorry . The heavy accent on glittering Hollywood glamor is not enough to sustain interest in a basically dull and obvious script , although it's easy to see why the color cinematography of lovely Riviera backgrounds brought the film an Oscar for Robert Burk . Hitchcock should have drawn a better performance from Grace Kelly instead of concentrating on her Oscar-nominated wardrobe .

412,"Text1: An interesting , ambitious , and somewhat entertaining satire of television , but one that pretty much fails for a number of reasons . It's difficult to believe almost everything that happens in it . Not one of the characters rings true . William Holden is as boring in 1976 as he was in 1955 , and his cliché relationship with Faye Dunnaway is not at all believable , and not even that interesting . Their scenes together go on forever , and Holden's character carries the trite and obvious metaphor of Dunnaway as television personified , and their relationship as soap opera far further than necessary . Dunnaway herself puts an amazing amount of energy into her performance , and she didn't not deserve the Oscar she won , if you'll excuse my double negative . But her character really is only the metaphor that Holden attributes her , so what ground can she win with that ? Beatrice Straight gives a performance that's most famous for being the shortest that ever won an Oscar , only three minutes . I didn't know who Beatrice Straight was , but it's obvious when she starts giving her big speech , so showy that she induced me to roll my eyes as many times as inches tall her Oscar is ; that must be a record , too . Robert Duvall fares the best among the major cast members , although he hasn't much of a character either . Peter Finch's performance is interesting , but his ranting gets old quick . While Howard Beale's first couple of ravings would undoubtedly raise people's interest ( the ' I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore ' scene is as great as it is famous ) , but I doubt the television show that is developed for him , which apparently airs five days a week and runs for many months before the film ends , would ever attract an audience of any kind , except maybe a small bit who have a taste for public access television , which is what it seems like . I think people , especially the kind of disenfranchised , cynical people to whom Beale's show is supposed to appeal , would be much more critical and suspicious of a man who does his show opposite a psychic and in front of stained glass window . People always refer to Network as ' prophetic , ' and then claim their proof is stuff like Jerry Springer , Hard Copy and reality television . As much as some of us may hate those kinds of television shows , only the deranged or stupid would ever believe that When Animals Attack is harmful to anybody other than those who are being attacked by animals . Does anybody really believe that anyone would ever air programs like The Ecumenical Liberation League or whatever that was ? Some of the scenes focusing on this new show which the network is developing seem to want to be comedy , although the film is too heavy-seeming to ever succeed in being comic . Anyhow , in the world of reality , in which Holden's character keeps trying to convince Dunnaway and the film's audience that the story is really happening , the network's lawyers would have stopped them immediately . I will say that the film is prescient in only one way : Ned Beatty , who appears for one scene , has the most intriguing part , where he says , among other things : "" It is the international system of currency which determines the vitality of life on this planet . That is the natural order of things today . That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today ! And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature ! And you will atone ! Am I getting through to you , Mr . Beale ? You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy . There is no America . There is no democracy . There is only IBM and ITT , and AT & T , and DuPont , Dow , Union Carbide , and Exxon . Those are the nations of the world today . "" It comes out of right field in the film - well , kind of . The almighty dollar is the driving force of the film , and , the film realizes correctly , the world . But what Network does not understand is how television works to propagate this system , or perhaps how it would . It's too busy finding its subject , television , overtly evil when it misses the ways it can be more subtly evil . Not that I think all TV is evil or anything . Personally , I watch a lot of television and enjoy it immensely . I don't think it is particularly wicked , and I actually think that there's a lot of great art to be found on television ( yes I do ! ) . However , most of the evil I do see comes from the news . I wasn't around in 1976 , so I can't say whether or not the news was as suspicious and creepy back then , but , if Network really had been prophetic , it would have at least got some of the satire right . .

Text2: Most people will not like this film . It's difficult to understand what's going on in the narrative . This isn't uncommon in Godard's work , but it's especially true of his later work . I've seen , besides New Wave , First Name : Carmen , Hail Mary , and his segment from the omnibus opera film Aria . That segment is actually one of his best works as well . Sticking with the two other features , they are both interesting and beautiful but very slow films . New Wave seems a lot like them at first , especially in its confusing narrative ( I had to read a synopsis on it to find out exactly what the plot was ) . It shares their beauty , but its even more pronounced . If I were advising someone on this film , I would tell them to disregard the narrative completely . Just watch it for its pictorial beauty . And its sound . Godard's experiments in sound have always been one of the most prominent traits of his cinema . It goes back at least to Une femme est une femme , way back in ' 62 . This film contains the most interesting experiments in sound . The music is absolutely beautiful , and , like many of his other films , it stops abruptly , pops back up when you're not expecting it , and shifts volumes randomly . The sound effects are also quite beautiful . While New Wave was perhaps dull in its narrative ( it's an examination of capitalism and consumerism ) , who cares ? This is film .

414,"Text1: ( Some Spoilers ) Very confusing movie about the last days of actor comedian John Belushi , Michael Chiklis , who after shooting himself up , with the help of his personal drug suppler Cathy Smith played by Patti D'Arbannille , with a combination cocaine heroin concoction-speed-ball-went into cardiac arrest and expired . It's then alone in the L . A County morgue that Belushi suddenly comes to life and ends up riding in a taxi cab with Angel Velasquez , Ray Sharkey , whom we find out is also like Belushi really dead , for some eight years , of a drug overdose . The rest of the movie has Belushi with both Angel's and Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward's , T . J Walsh , help review his short life , Belushi was 33 at the time of his death , and how he so royally screwed it up . The film "" Wired "" is so confusing in it going back and forth in time that you have trouble following it not knowing if the John Belushi on the screen is either the live or the dead one . We do have John doing a number of his memorable acts , on TV and in the movies , but their more or less padding giving the film , thats seems far to long , its 112 minutes of running time . The film really gets interested when it focus on Belushi's drug addiction that lead to his untimely death on the morning of March 5 , 1982 . Losing control of both his career and wife Judy , Lucinda Jenney , due to the pressures of being on top , as a Hollywood super star , John's reliance on drugs , mostly cocaine , took precedent over everything else in his life . Too strung out to work and feeling that he's soon to become poison , after a string of flops , in the box office Belushi just about gave up on himself . Belushi spent all his time , when he was supposed to be writing a script for his latest film , in his plush L . A hotel room getting himself high on the drugs that ended up killing him . Depressing movie that shows what drugs , legal as well as illegal , can do to you and those you love by letting them take control of your life . John Belushi's life as well as death is all too common in Hollywood with drugs , like cocaine , being readily available to big time actors and actresses like himself . Belushi's serious drug addiction wasn't a secret to those who knew him which makes his death even that much more tragic . Instead of trying to get him help , in drug rehabilitation , Belushi's desperate plight was put aside-by his employers - as long he brought the big bucks into the studios . It's when his career started to wane that Belushi drug dependency started to intensify and get out of control . John Belushi wasn't alone in having himself end up on a cold slab in the L . A County morgue ! He had a lot of help from those who encouraged and supply him with illegal drugs over the years . But in the end it was John and only John , by giving into his drug addiction and refusing to get help , who was more responsible then anyone else in having himself end up there . P . S It's Bob Woodward's biographical book on John Belushi's wild and stormy life , as well as his tragic but not at all unexpected death , that the movie "" Wired "" is based on .

Text2: But once again actors in their mid-to-late twenties are playing teenagers and the effect of the film is totally ruined as they behave and act so unrealistic . While most people may consider this a cool movie just because of the scares and the over-hyped ' irony ' there is actually an intelligent plot with a pretty good twist . I notice this more as I am a writer and this is one of my fave horror / thrillers . I advise you not to watch this for the pumped up scares ( to a very loud soundtrack ) but for how a typical ' who's the killer ? ' plot line can be a little better than it is believed to be . Some of the characters can be really annoying . In fact the only one that doesn't enrage me is Dewey . His idiotness makes me laugh and diverts my attention from the other characters in the very slow ' character building scenes ' . The direction and photography are very bland . Wes Craven did a much better job of a real horror film with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET . Here it just seems as if he aiming at the teen / popcorn market . You'll notice that , with these kind of movies , most of the characters ( not actors ) are teenagers and the tone of the film is mostly ' safe ' . In the Scream ' sub-genre ' there is never any REAL edge . After this movie was made , many , increasing bad , movies that were all exactly the same rolled off a conveyor belt in Hollywood . They were easy moneymakers . Craven knew this beforehand but deep , intelligent movies do not sit well with mass audiences . The blander the style of film is , the more popular it will be with the majority of audiences . The plot in this one redeems these bad qualities . I just wish for a real horror film to come out of Hollywood .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
415,"Text1: I have seen documentaries on DOCTOR WHO in the past but to be honest they're almost always disappointing at best . Not so with with 30 YEARS IN THE TARDIS which is the greatest documentary ever to have featured British telefantasy's best loved icon . What I absolutely loved about this tribute was seeing stuff I thought I'd never see like a TV advert for ice lollies featuring the Doctor or some 8mm silent film footage of William Hartnell opening an air show or the winner of a "" Build your Doctor Who monster "" or what a Dalek playsuit looks like on a young boy . This is an absolutely amazing documentary for casual fans or diehard ones like myself . The fact that 30 YEARS IN THE TARDIS was made by fellow fans really shines through . Take for example the opening of the young boy on his way home and sees a post box suddenly transform into a Dalek . I can testify that as a child this also happened to me . As a child dustbins often did the same , and bollards . Yes I know that sounds extremely sad , but in a mundane cynical cruel world of adulthood I really miss the days when I looked forward to seeing the next DOCTOR WHO episode on a Saturday teatime . Thank you to everyone involved in making this great documentary

Text2: Maybe it was the title , or the trailer ( certainly not the interview on the DVD , which is with the director as he keeps saying "" hi , kids "" into the camera like a buffoon ) , but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal , bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator . Turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good , or bad , or whatever . There's a problem - and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust , similar to this in many respects - in not having balance to the sex and violence . Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno , and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies ! And with the killing scenes , there has to be at least a little tack , and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity , in creating the creature / killer / whatever . Entrails of a Virgin has neither . It's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie , even if isn't one of the very worst ever made - it's there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their ' other ' heads . In this case , we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls , nothing too salacious , and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by "" A Murderer "" as he's credited . First off , the director Kazuo ' Gaira ' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on - we get spliced in ( or phoned in , take your pick ) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere . It looks like it's from another movie . Then once settled into the house , there's a ' wrestling ' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot ( yeah , we really need to see him ' all ' there ) , and then on to the rape and killings . First the rape , by the photographers , who promise the girls some jobs for their time . Then the Murderer , who like D'Amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial , and who for an unknown reason kills the men and / or rapes the women one by one . Now , the latter of those , taken by themselves , should be considered the highlights of the movie . This is like saying , however , that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad . An eye-gouging scene , a spike thrown like an Olympic event ( that scene , actually , is kind of cool ) , and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl , whose inconsequential name I can't remember . Even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title ! On top of this , the sex scenes , which become tedious through ' Gaira ' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway , are dubbed over by the actors ( you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough , hence the need to let them ' speak ' for themselves ) . But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one , where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror ( watch as the last girl left alive , the virgin of the picture , tries to stop the murderer from getting to her , which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him ! ) You just want it to be done with , for the ' I hate women ' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

C . where Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII ( Richard O'Sullivan ) is supreme ruler of Egypt , having "" desposed "" of his Queen sister Cleopatra ( Dame Elizabeth Taylor ) . But along comes Caesar ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Rex Harrison ) to restore some order to the kingdom of Egypt , despite being from Rome , he even sees to marrying the Queen and having a son , oh , and Ptolemy was banished . It is when Caesar is murdered that trouble starts again some years later , when his protégé Marc Antony ( Richard Burton , who married Liz the next year ) has become smitten by Cleopatra , and she can't help herself . She is angered when she finds out he is marrying Octavia ( Jean Marsh ) , sister of the ambitious Octavian - Caesar Augustus ( Golden Globe nominated Roddy McDowall ) , and he quickly changes his mind , and marries Cleopatra . There is a war with some battleships shooting at each other , a bit of banter and politics , and the film ends with Antony dying , and Cleopatra following not too long after . Also starring Pamela Brown as High Priestess , George Cole as Flavius , Hume Cronyn as Sosigenes , Cesare Danova as Apollodorus , Kenneth Haigh as Brutus , Andrew Keir as Agrippa , young Martin Landau as Rufio , Robert Stephens as Germanicus , Francesca Annis as Eiras , Grégoire Aslan as Pothinus and Martin Benson as Ramos , I have to say , some of the oddest character names I have ever heard . Apparently , back then it cost around $40 million to make , today that would be around $250 million ( that would beat Titanic's $250 million ) , it could have been because of Taylor getting sick a lot . More obvious reason would be the length of the film , four hours and eight minutes of nearly blah , sexy , blah , politics , blah , battle , blah , death , it was obvious I would doze off at some point . I much preferred the spoof film Carry On Cleo . It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design and Best Special Visual Effects , and it was nominated for Best Film Editing , Best Music for Alex North , Best Sound and Best Picture , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77 , and Richard Burton number 70 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses , Burton was number 29 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses , she was also number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and she was number 7 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Women .

Text2: Dedicated scientist Alec Holland ( Ray Wise ) is working on a revolutionary formula when sexy government agent Alice Cable ( Adrienne Barbeau ) is sent to watch over him . When arrogant megalomaniac Arcane ( Louis Jourdan ) and his bevy of henchmen step in , poor Alec is doused with his own formula , set on fire , and runs outside to plummet into the swamp . Soon , Alec is reborn as the title character ( now played by stuntman Dick Durock ) . Still in love with Barbeau , he sets out to rescue her from the bad guys ( and she needs a lot of rescuing throughout ) and takes them on . "" Swamp Thing "" , an adaptation of the cult DC comic , may very well be cheesy stuff , but it's still very likable entertainment . Key to its success is that it's got a lot of heart to go with its goofier moments . The relationship between Alec and Alice is handled very sensitively . However , that's not to say that writer / director Wes Craven ever takes the whole thing too seriously . It also has plenty of very amusing moments . ( For one thing , young Reggie Batts as Jude displays a nice aptitude for deadpan delivery of his lines . ) The monster suits - both Swamp Thing himself and the abomination that Arcane turns into - are a real hoot to look at . On-location filming in South Carolina really helps ; the local atmosphere is very potent . Craven even goes so far as to use comic book style scene transitions , including frequent "" wipes "" . Harry Manfredini supplies the music score , which sounds awfully close to his compositions for the "" Friday the 13th "" series at times . It all adds up to a good time . Both Wise and Barbeau are very sincere and very appealing . David Hess , "" Krug "" in Craven's "" The Last House on the Left "" , is a gas as Arcane's headband-wearing primary goon , as is Nicholas Worth as the bumbling Bruno . Durock does a fine job of acting under his makeup and suit . But Jourdan is definitely the most fun with his flamboyant portrayal of the villainous Arcane . "" Swamp Thing "" may not be one of the most notable pictures of Craven's career , but it shouldn't be forgotten , either . It may be lighter in tone than the horror pictures that he has given us , but that's part of its charm .

Samantha Stone ( well played by the gorgeous Brittany Daniel ) interviews nervous and scared suspected serial killer Kenneth Bianchi ( a strong and compelling performance by Clifton Collins , Jr . ) in order to determine if he's sane or crazy . Director / co-writer Chris Farber relates this engrossing story in a deliciously flashy'n'trashy style which creates a considerable amount of raw energy and crackling intensity . Farber's unapologetically seamy and nasty rub-your-nose-in-the-gutter sensibility may not be subtle , but it does give the picture a lurid vitality that's both exciting and arresting in equal measure . Moreover , there's a vivid and credible evocation of the wild anything-goes hedonism and amorality of the 70's . For example , Samantha is the total opposite of a squeaky clean goody-goody two shoes heroine ; instead she's a completely uninhibited swinger who smokes pot and participates in crazy drug'n'sex orgies . Daniel and Collins , Jr . are both excellent in the leads , with Collins , Jr . in particular a stand-out with his frightening portrayal of raging psychosis and seething misogyny . The supporting cast is likewise solid and praiseworthy : Lake Bell as Samantha's brassy District Attorney best friend Jillian Dunne , Bret Roberts as Samantha's scuzzy dope dealer boyfriend Jack , Tom Wright as the hard-nosed Detective Bryant , and Mike Haggerty as Bryant's equally gruff partner Detective Smith . Tomas Arana makes a brief , but still memorably chilling appearance as the coarse and slimy Angelo Buono .

423,"Text1: TCM has to be congratulated by the magnificent documentary about Greta Garbo it presented recently . As directed by Kevin Brownlow , the film concentrates in presenting a balanced portrait of one of the strongest personalities that graced the screen during the XX Century : Greta Garbo . The narration by Julie Christie , is excellent . "" Garbo "" presents a vivid picture of the mythical figure of Greta Garbo , from her humble origins , to the height of her fame , to the years of oblivion . One thing that comes clear in the film is that contrary to what one might think , Ms . Garbo was not a recluse , on the contrary , she filled her days roaming the streets of her adopted city , New York . The director is to be commended in that he takes us everywhere , covering the life of the actress . He even takes us where no one else has dared to go , Greta Garbo's inner sanctum , the apartment where she lived on the upper east side of Manhattan . We get glimpses of how the great Garbo lived in her elegant place overlooking the East River , where we see some of the paintings she collected . For a woman with humble origins , Ms . Garbo deserves a lot of credit for making herself the exquisite figure she became . One has to put oneself in her shoes to realize that she just wanted to live like anyone else did , shunning the limelight and being the down to earth woman she was . Some of the people interview in the film , like her several family members , the great Clarence Brown , who directed her in some of her best films , George Cukor , and Charles Busch expand on what really comes across that she was an honest human being who had her feet on the ground and had no pretensions or vanity . Her glamorous past was history and all she wanted was to stay away from all the glitter . Congratulations to Kevin Brownlow for his perceptive take on the woman and the myth .

Text2: I first saw Notre Musique at the NY film festival , and responded to it strongly because it was , after going through a slew of his more recent work of the 80s and 90s ( often hit or miss , more miss ) , a very well structured , interesting picture with a very distinct look and feel that balanced the elegiac and darkness with some light . Watching it again , I'm still fascinated most by the first segment ' Hell ' . If this was just a stand-alone short film , I would rank it among some of Godard's best work from the 60s . It's brash , it's seemingly unending , the narration actually does fit the images on screen ( which , from my perspective , is what ends up usually irking me with some of Godard's later work when he does this ) , and all of these images of civilization decaying through war and other disasters , and the machinery and technology used for all of this death and horror , really works to a great effect . Purgatory , the second segment , is often quite good , as it's a really well-balanced mix of fiction and documentary as real life writers and professors and journalists go through issues like Sarajevo , troubles in the middle east , and cinema itself as Godard humorously and sometimes somberly goes through a lecture to some students as he's part of the setting . There's even a perfectly understated , interested performance by the lead Sarah Adler . When the film then transforms into the last act , Paradise , it kind of starts to break some of the power and interest in the previous sections of the film ( I didn't really connect with much of the symbolism , as beautifully photographed as it all was ) . But what ends up really impressing me most about Notre Musique is that I really could understand most , if not all , of what many of these long stretches of dialog were about - unlike in some past , notoriously messy films by the director - and it worked without Godard's way of filming subjects and locations . Julien Hirsch's cinematography , going through the director's vision , is often so striking I'd say it's some of the best that was done in 2004 anywhere . There's still some kind of documentarian's spirit at heart , and it really does work best in the conversations that go on in the film , as lots of subject matter gets covered . This mixed with a partially fictionalized story helps to make something pretty special , if not really sensational , and in its 80 minute running time nothing overstays its welcome . If anything , the film is almost too short by a few minutes . It's a mix of history , politics , poetry , cinema , and the meanings of life and death , and not often does it come off pretentious .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Too many so-called ' romantic comedies ' come out nowadays that are just ridiculous-all they are are stupid , dumb , unrealistic teen movies . But alas , when a romantic film is done right , you get a nice surprise , which Notting Hill was . The screenplay is very humorous and pleasant , and so is the acting . While Hugh Grant is nothing great , I must say he chooses good romantic comedies to be in . I lived in England over 5 years , and picked up the British ' humor ' that is so many times overlooked , or called ' raunchy ' and while their sitcoms may be this sometimes , the main humor is not raunchy ! Notting Hill captures this humor and puts it in a blender , along with a great screenplay , cinematography , and chemistry . All in all I found Notting Hill to be a very pleasant , nice surprise , that female and male alike can enjoy . stars - - JOHN ULMER

Text2: A film like "" Jaws 2 "" proves that we can , indeed , get too much of a good thing . Action and shark over substance and character development . Somewhere along the way "" Jaws "" went from being about deep , intelligent characters in intense situations to shallow teenagers in B-monster-movie moments . "" Jaws 2 , "" or "" Jaws2 "" ( no space in between "" s "" and "" 2 "" ) , takes place four years after the horrid events in Amity , seen in the first film . Police Chief Brody ( Roy Scheider , commonly mistaken for Rob Schneider with today's audience ) is a veteran of a shark attack , of course . And like most sequels involving characters who once battled a beast of some sort and survived , Brody is now the official expert on sharks . When a boat blows up off shore , Brody suspects a shark . When a killer whale is found dead with chomp marks , Brody suspects a shark . Heck , you could blow up the state of Arkansas and Brody would probably think it's a shark . Soon Brody loses his job because the town mayor ( Murray Hamilton , reprising his role shortly in this film because he had to stop filming to attend to his sick wife ) doesn't like poor Brody , even after the events of the first film . Then Brody's seventeen-year-old son goes out on a sail boat and before you can go , "" Duh-duh-duh-duh "" JAWS is coming at him and his friends . Brody goes , tries to save them , and you can guess what the outcome is . Okay , here are some things I noticed that hindered this film : 1 . The first thing that hits you over the head here is how this film is painfully a copy in every way of the first film , only about ten times worse . There is no suspense - - they show the shark from the beginning on . In a documentary made just for the "" Jaws2 "" DVD , the director says that "" The shark has already been seen , so there's no suspense - - you might as well show it . "" Well , this is a bit true - - I hate when horror sequels wait till the end to show the creature ( "" Predator 2 "" ) even though we've seen them in the first . But the way they do it here is painfully un-suspenseful . The film really contains no sense of suspense . 2 . You'd think that everyone in the town would have learned their lesson last time : Brody was right about a shark , and he saved the day . Here we see everyone turning back to their old ways and ignoring Brody . You could give excuses for this , but the fact of the matter remains : It's just another retread of the first film , done on a much lesser scale . 3 . The shark here is shown too much - - he looks like a rubber ducky in a bathtub . Kids scream as it attacks boats and helicopters - - yes , helicopters ( that looks strange on paper ) - - and the shark comes out of the water head first to swim forward . Now , unlike the first film where the shark was never shown very well - - because of mechanical problems or not , they still didn't show it - - they show the shark many , many times here . And unlike the first when they DID show the shark , in "" Jaws2 "" they make the shark look utterly unrealistic . In the first the rubber shark swam like a shark - - this thing swims like a giant piece of rubber in an ocean . 4 . The director obviously went for action over story : Steven Spielberg masterfully crafted an instense and scary film , yet at the same time provided a very interesting character study . Here , we just see blood , guts , and big rubber sharks - - something that might look good in a B-horror-movie , but not in a "" Jaws "" film . 5 . What are the remote chances that another 25-foot Great White Shark ( capitalized for effect ) would be off the coast off the small town Amity twice ? Perhaps this will answer that question : After finding a killer whale , Brody asks a marine biologist ( filling in Richard Dreyfuss ' most-missed shoes ) , "" You don't think if one shark dies , another shark could come and "" - - he gets cut off by the marine biologist , who says , "" Sharks don't take things personally , Mr . Brody . "" Well , that's funny , according to the tagline for the forth film they do . Perhaps that is one of the confusing elements of this film . Is the shark attacking because Brody killed the other one four years ago ? Or is it just an odd coincidence ? We may never know . Steven Spielberg had the smarts to move on after the first project , as did Richard Dreyfuss , and Roy Scheider should have said "" no , "" too , because you can't flog a dead fish and expect people to jump . ( Did that make sense ? Sorry , I had a good catch-phrase in my head but it didn't come out right . ) The first film should have been a stand alone , but in the case that they should make a sequel to one of the most cherished films of all time , for heaven's sake , make it good ! So now I come back to my original question . What should my header be for this review ? And then I got it : "" This time it's kind of personal ! "" stars - John Ulmer","{""output"": ""NO""}"
425,"Text1: John Wayne's sixteenth and final picture for Lone Star Films was the only one directed by Carl L . Pierson . In the story , Wayne's character John Wyatt joins a traveling medicine show to expose a band of counterfeiters ; one suspects that the phony money men might be part of Doc Carter's ( Earl Hodgins ) bunch . Instead , it's a crew run by Curly Joe Gale ( Yakima Canutt ) , who was once the Doc's partner before Carter got busted for the counterfeit scheme . You'll get a kick out of the coach at the center of ' Carter's Greater Medicine Show ' , I can just picture similar get ups heading from town to town to ply the local rubes . Carter has a pretty but naive young daughter Linda ( Marion Burns ) , who doubles in the show as Princess Natasha . However the entire affair is pretty much a vehicle for selling ' Doc Carter's Famous Indian Remedy ' , and at ninety percent alcohol , it's pretty potent stuff . As for the real bad guys , government agent Wyatt eventually gets the drop on Curly Joe , with a posse of Mexican rurales chasing down Curly's gang in the finale . It's all wrapped up quickly in just about fifty three minutes , perhaps the shortest of all the Lone Star pictures . Having now seen all of the Lone Star's , a quick recap reveals that stunt man extraordinaire Yakima Canutt appeared on screen in twelve of the sixteen films in various roles , sometimes as John Wayne's sidekick and often as a henchman . On three occasions , as in this film , he portrayed the main villain . The others were "" Sagebrush Trail "" and "" ' Neath Arizona Skies "" . Even though he didn't appear in "" Paradise Canyon "" , George Hayes showed up in eleven Lone Star's ; back then he wasn't known as ' Gabby ' yet . Earl Dwire tied Hayes with the same number of roles , however he was one up on Hayes with an uncredited bit part as an Arizona sheriff in this one , but you'll really have to keep your eyes peeled to spot him . All of Wayne's Lone Star films were filmed between 1933 and 1935 , and are quite easily available today , most if not all in the public domain . They can be had rather inexpensively , either alone or in compilations , and they're a great way to see one of movie's greatest stars before he became a household name . Your first viewing will probably give you the same impression I had , marveling at how young and handsome Wayne appeared while learning his craft . By the time of his breakout characterization as the Ringo Kid in John Ford's "" Stagecoach "" , Wayne had appeared in a little over fifty films , starring in most , while patiently awaiting the role that would make him an overnight success .

Text2: I'm not sure that "" These Wilder Years "" is the best title that this film could have come up with ; Cagney's reputation as a movie gangster might have hinted at something a bit more daring . However the picture features a well thought out story line and engages the viewer right from the start with Steve Bradford's ( Cagney ) resolve to find the son he gave up twenty years earlier when all he had on his mind was building a business empire . He hits a brick wall in the person of Ann Dempster ( Barbara Stanwyck ) , proprietor of ' The Haven ' , and someone who will not surrender her principles or the rule of adoption law against Bradford's millions . A sub plot involving Cagney's character and a teenage unwed mother ( Betty Lou Keim ) adds an element of human tenderness to what could have been just another courtroom drama showdown . Oddly , that potential showdown was hinted at when Bradford's corporate attorney Rayburn ( Walter Pidgeon ) advised his client against the national publicity that would arise from the case because of Bradford's prominence as a steel tycoon . All the while I was expecting the kind of fanfare from "" Miracle on 34th Street "" , but guess what ? - there wasn't a reporter or even a spectator in sight . That seemed a bit of a disconnect following Rayburn's buildup , but not entirely unwelcome . I actually liked the lawyer's perspective in his handling of the case , as if he were in tune to the humanity of the opposition along with his own . Can you imagine that ? Of course the teary eyed moment comes when the viewer realizes a few moments before Bradford himself that he's about to meet his own son . Somehow you knew Miss Dempster would see to it that Bradford's persistence would have a resolution , the payoff was in the manner in which it was presented . Neither played for melodrama or hysterics , one could feel Bradford's loss when the two parted ways with a handshake . The movie is a nice counter point to Cagney's more traditional roles , particularly since the star , who's almost always on screen , doesn't dominate his scenes with his celebrity or performance . It's a somewhat offbeat role for one of cinema's greatest actors , and one that deserves a viewing for both his performance and the story it tells .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
426,"Text1:  La bandera  is one of Julien Duvivier's most famous movies , but it seems a bit dated now . People who saw a version of "" Beau Geste "" cannot help but be struck by the similarities between the two stories : the "" legion etrangere "" , as a way out when the police is hot on your heels . But whereas Beau Geste characters are noble , distinguished and chivalrous , Duvivier's hero and his mates are riffraff . The main character , played by Gabin , is a good guy who committed an unpremeditated murder . The best part of the movie , in my opinion , is the description of the fort , the barrack-rooms , the brothel . Here , the hero falls in love with a morrocan girl . There's the rub : she's played by Annabella ( who was Tyrone Power's wife ) who does not look like a North African , not at all , hence the necessity to make her up outrageously , with ugly results . Like in "" Beau Geste "" , the Arabs are the baddies , period . The courageous legionnaires always call them "" les salopards "" ( the bastards ) . Duvivier achieves a real tour de force here : we never see the enemy when they attack the little fort ! The poisoned water is a good dramatic idea and the final echoes Edith Piaf's song "" le fanion de la légion "" . However , "" la bandera "" , with its military stereotypes , does not equal Duvivier's other pre-war works "" la fin du jour "" , "" carnet de bal "" , "" la belle équipe "" or "" pépé le moko "" , the latter taking place in North Africa too .

Text2: HG Clouzot whose best works ( "" diabolique "" "" salaire de la peur "" "" le corbeau "" and "" quai des orfèvres "" ) rank among the best French works of all time , had health problems after "" la vérité "" ( 1960 ) . Thus the eight - year gap , between that latter movie and his final opus "" la prisonnière "" . Between , there was another film "" l'enfer "" , starring Romy Schneider and Samy Frey but it was never finished . Claude Chabrol would take on the screenplay about thirty years later with Emmanuelle Béart and François Cluzet with startling results . In fact Claude Chabrol is HGC's closest relative . No matter if Chabrol sprang from the nouvelle vague and Clouzot was part of their "" enemies "" : Chabrol was ( and is ) closer to Clouzot than any other new wave directors , be it Truffaut or Godard . Were "" la prisonnière "" labelled a Chabrol's film , it would not enjoy , so to speak , such a low rating . "" La prisonnière "" is HGC's only color film and it remains a disturbing intriguing work . In "" quai des orfèvres "" , a lipstick lesbian was taking photographs of models , and thus sublimated what she probably thought was a sin ( it was 1947 ! ) . In "" la prisonnière "" a young man ( Laurent Terzieff a very earnest thespian ) takes photographs of humiliated women . A young bourgeois girl ( Wiener ) married with a straight-in every senses of the term - husband ( Bernard Fresson ) discovers his secret by chance , and wants to take a walk on the wild side . She won't escaped unharmed . Like Catherine Deneuve in Bunuel's "" Belle de Jour "" she is at the mercy of her fantasies : but whereas Severine , Bunuel's heroine , lived in a fantsy world , Josée , HGC's girl , works as a TV editor and the films about which she works deal with women's sex and violence problems . Although dated , but not more than Bowman's final journey in "" 2001 "" , the psychedelic effects are used masterfully . Although by no means a "" nouvelle vaguesque "" director , HGC experiments here and the heroine's dream in the hospital is still impressive today .

427,"Text1: Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep is set in a stretch of Ocean called the Desolation Passage where marine archaeologist Nicole ( Victoria Pratt ) & her crew are searching for a couple of legendary Greek artifacts , a ceremonial Trojan war mask & a hugely valuable Opal . Unfortunately Nicole & her crew are hampered by a few unforeseen problems , first off is Maxwell Odemus ( Jack Scalia ) the son of a Greek mafia gangster who wants the two relics returned to Greece by any means necessary & there's also the small fact that a gigantic squid is guarding the precious bounty & basically kills anyone who goes near it . Can Nicole beat the odds , find the treasure & become famous or will she & her crew end up as squid food ? Directed by Tibor Takacs this is yet another by-the-numbers Nu Image produced creature feature the likes of which I'm sick of . The script by Sean Keller & Brian D . Young has all the usual clichés & plot devices these creature features do , there's the beautiful female scientist , a rugged male hero type , there's the disposable character's who are included for no other reason other than to be killed & of course there's the assortment of bad guys who want something valuable that some mutated badly CGI animated creature of some sort is either guarding or is just generally in the way of . There really isn't anything original , fresh or new about Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep at all & quite frankly it's a bit of a chore to sit through , there are already loads of these bad killer creature feature type films out there & this doesn't do the sub genre's reputation any favours . I sat there thinking I'd already this dozens of times before & I'm right , scientists look for something , get attacked by monster , hero kills monster & saves girl at the end , that's all there is too it . The character's are bland & forgettable as is the dialogue , the giant squid isn't in it nearly enough & doesn't do anything particularly special when it does make an appearance . It's all very predictable & isn't even unintentionally funny , if you really like these creature features , someone out there has to or they wouldn't keep making them , then you'll probably enjoy Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep to some extent but for those of us who are really bored of this type of film I urge you to steer well clear of it . Director Takacs was once a decent genre filmmaker with titles like The Gate ( 1987 ) & I , Madman ( 1989 ) but he seems to have gone down the creature feature route with dreck like this , Rats ( 2003 ) , Mansquito ( 2005 ) , Ice Spiders ( 2007 ) & his latest epic MegaSnake ( 2007 ) ! This made-for-TV film is quite well made , the giant squid CGI computer effects aren't as bad as I had expected although that's not to say they are good . The version I saw was titled Deadly Waters which is what it was shot under , apparently the Sci-Fi Channel's website held a competition for fans to come up with a better title & I guess Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep won which I suppose is why the word ' Kraken ' is never used in the film itself . Forget about any gore , there's a severed leg , some blood & a cool decapitation by fishing line but nothing else that graphic or worth mentioning . I'm also sorry to inform you that there is no nudity at all . The supposed budget of about $2 , 100 , 000 doesn't sound too bad actually so it's a surprise that overall the film is rather flat , bland & forgettable . The acting isn't great from nobody worth mentioning . Kraken : Tentacles of the Deep is another creature feature that is virtually indistinguishable from any other , catch it on the Sci-Fi Channel for sure but don't go wasting your money on it .

431,"Text1: This was the fourth and last in a series of "" Big Broadcast "" movies made by Paramount over a period of seven years ; they were essentially the studio's reply to MGM's run of "" Broadway Melody "" releases . I've watched two among the latter franchise ( see below and the 1940 entry ) but this is my first brush with the "" Big Broadcast "" series ; comparing the two , it seems the MGM films had much more plot than Paramount's ? but the latter , to their ultimate advantage , incorporated much more comedy . In this particular case , we get two ( ! ) W . C . Fields and , in his screen debut , Bob Hope ; the former is his typical larger-than-life and iconoclastic self ( traveling on a motorbike that can spread its wings and fly ! ) ? who manages to revive two of his favorite game routines i . e . golf and billiards ? while the latter is already the wisecracking heel ( who has four wives to his name and another in the offing ! ) emceeing the entertainment aboard one of two cruise-liners engaged in a race . The show involves several long-forgotten ( and now highly-resistible ) attractions ? ranging from a Mexican heart-throb to a female soprano ? and even a bland bit of animation ( courtesy of Leon Schlesinger from Warners ' "" Looney Tunes "" stable ) . Needless to say , there is the obligatory romance as well ? between Hope's proposed No . 5 wife Dorothy Lamour and inventor Leif Erickson , Hope's own re-affirmed affection for ex-spouse Shirley Ross ( while singing his signature tune , the Oscar-winning "" Thanks For The Memory "" ) and between Fields ' even wackier daughter Martha Raye and her companion Lynne Overman . All the various stars ( including a redundant third comic in Ben Blue ) get to do their thing , but the laughter element is clearly the most effective ? with Fields ' surreal antics ( the best of which , perhaps , is when he unwittingly blows up a gas station ) and Hope's quips mixing quite well ( though the two barely ever meet throughout ! ) . Most of the music , then , is pretty dire ( as already intimated ) , while the choreography includes an energetic number highlighting Raye and the expected splashy finale . At least , director Leisen ( who had also helmed the previous entry from 1937 ) lends the film his customary surface style .

Text2: Throughout the 1950s and 1960s , glossy soap operas were among Hollywood's most popular offerings ? before such melodramatic stuff became standard TV fare , a status which holds up to this day . These are hardly my kind of genre picture ? which , perhaps , explains why I've yet to sit through efforts even as acclaimed as PEYTON PLACE ( 1957 ) ! Incidentally , given the title's similarity to another Charlton Heston vehicle ( which actually preceded this viewing ) ? namely the Western ARROWHEAD ( 1953 ) ? it's no wonder that this isn't a reference to anything in particular , and certainly doesn't come up at all in the script ! Anyway , while the film doesn't have much of a reputation ? especially since it came at the height of Heston's epic phase ? I found it surprisingly tolerable ( apart from some impossibly corny dance routines from the locals : the narrative is set in Hawaii , to which the star would return for the aptly-named THE HAWAIIANS [ 1970 ] , which I hopefully also intend to check out in time for this ongoing Heston marathon ) . Interestingly , good ol ' Chuck is perhaps at his most unsympathetic here ? playing someone who can only be described as selfish , pig-headed and a hypocrite ! Besides , given the actor's controversial latter-day political activity ( and which seems to have received undue attention at the time of his passing ) , it's worth noting that his character in the film is persuaded to run for a place in the Senate because of his influence in the community ? but the eventual campaign is botched due to personal scandals ( having forbidden his kid sister Yvette Mimieux to marry local boy James Darren , is implicated in the latter's violent death , and himself impregnates Hawaiian France Nuyen ! ) . The cast features a number of current ' stars ' , whose allure would basically vanish by the end of the decade : apart from the afore-mentioned Mimieux , Darren ( best-remembered for the blockbuster THE GUNS OF NAVARONE [ 1961 ] , he would go on to play the bewildered protagonist in Jess Franco's erotic / cerebral masterpiece VENUS IN FURS [ 1968 ] ) and Nuyen ( she was often paired with Hollywood leading men in such Asian-set romantic dramas ) , there are George Chakiris ( as Darren's half-brother , who also gets in Heston's hair by falling for Mimieux himself ) and Elizabeth Allen ( appearing here as the glamorous sister of Heston's late wife , and naturally secretly harboring emotions for him , she would later graduate to leading lady for another Hawaiian flick ? the John Ford / John Wayne comic romp DONOVAN'S REEF [ 1963 ] ) . An important supporting role , however , is that of veteran Aline MacMahon as the typically indomitable mother figure ( of Chakiris and Darren's characters ) . If handled properly , such histrionic stuff can be reasonably entertaining ( especially given their predilection for confrontation scenes ) : this one's well enough done under the circumstances ( with Darren's untimely demise being handled in a particularly inventive manner ) but , for good measure , includes a Freudian dream sequence towards the end !

Young ) over for dinner . But the bloodsuckers ' bestial and deranged snarling subhuman pet Toby ( a marvelously crazed portrayal by Dave R . Watkins ) threatens to ruin everything with his rude and unruly behavior . Writer / director Watkins delivers a brisk and witty short horror comedy feature that offers a fine amusing line in twisted black humor , pokes inspired fun at the suburbanite obsession with always maintaining a pleasant and respectable appearance , and culminates in a neat surprise conclusion that's neither obvious nor expected . This film further benefits from the uniformly solid acting by an appealing and good-looking cast , with the pretty and alluring Biggs rating as the definite stand-out of the bunch . Melanie Mascioli's slick cinematography and Daniel Solammon's shuddery , syncopated score are both up to speed as well . A cute little tongue-in-cheek fright flick romp .

When the piglets abandon him for their mother , he executes them by hanging , and the sow shows the first distress she has shown for the whole film .

The action is set on a secluded rural farm and the film is completely devoid of dialogue . Still despite its truly repellent subject matter the action is slow , but the scenes of the farmer sodomizing his swine or eating his own excrement are sick as hell .

Look at the actors here they're far too old to be elite combat troops , they're all Victor McLaglen wannabees but without the talent .

435,"Text1: Michael Caine plays a pathetic wretch who , 40 years ago , participated in the murder of seven Jews in France . Certain rogue elements within the Catholic Church have been hiding him , shuffling him from place to place , and another organization has been sending him money from time to time . I'm a little confused about the other organization . I think it may have been founded by his fellow executioners , also war criminals , but it wasn't easy to follow . Caine is a marvelous actor , but this thoroughly dramatic role of a devout Frenchman , suffering from heart failure , tortured by guilt and constantly praying , is almost beyond him . He is forced to shoot two assassins sent after him by his fellow war criminals , and at those points the movie comes to life , so to speak . So there are two conflicting interests in pursuit of him - - the police who want to put him in jail , and the assassins who want to kill him before he is caught and makes a deal with the gendarmes . The assassins get there first . Caine is such a pitiful figure , stumbling about and asking for help when cornered , that one is reminded at times of much better films like "" Odd Man Out "" and "" M "" . We more or less know from the beginning that no Vichy war criminal is going to escape and live happily ever after , so watching Caine huffing and puffing around on rooftops and constantly asking priests for absolution is painful . And repetitive too . Halfway through I began wishing the cops would get him - - or the assassins for that matter - - or that he would expire from an acute infraction of the myoculinary - - just to get it over with . The Catholic church comes off pretty badly . The Vatican wants nothing to do with him . The monks who are his old friends are told to stop helping him . Except for his demons , no one is interested in him . His patron saint , he claims , is St . Christopher , whom I thought had been kicked out of the Pantheon years ago . If I'm right , then he's praying to a discredited saint . ( Is this supposed to be symbolism ? ) It would have been spot on if he'd chosen St . Jude , the patron saint of lost causes , whose medallion I have so aptly clipped to the visor of my Ford . At any rate , we don't see him do anything that could be construed as a reflection of his Nazi-tainted past . He's weak , old , and scared to death . ( Come to think of it , he looks a little like Max von Sydow with his gray hair . ) It's true that he threatens to kill his wife's dog if she doesn't put him up . And it's true that he offhandedly boots the dog out of the way when he gets underfoot . I hope that's not a crime worth being executed for . Caine's performance is so weary and ridden with Angst that I kind of wished he'd get away to Quebec or somewhere . He was involved in those seven murders and should pay for it . At the same time his soul has been in jail for more than 40 years . His best bet , of course , would have been to give himself up to the police , confess openly to his crimes , and spend the rest of his life in jail . It's too easy for a priest to listen to him and say "" Ego te absolvo , now go away . "" You commit a sin , you do penance for it . I don't want to get into the moral implications any further because they're pretty muddled . I'm not really sure what the film's point of view is . Is it that the Catholic church is corrupt and anti-Semitic ? Is it that repentant sinners deserve to be shot to death by criminals ? It's one of the lesser works by director Jewison , Michael Caine , and most of the other involved . The photography , of Provence , is nice . And the shrike-like woman detective is good too , all angular and sharp eyes . But it's a slow slog overall .

Text2:  Something's wrong with the entire system ,  says Wilton Sekzer , an aging Vietnam vet who lost his son on . When Sekzer first learned his son had died in the WTC , his first response was a surge in patriotism and a desire for revenge . When we invaded Iraq , Sekzer emailed the government and asked that his son's name be painted on a bomb , a wish that , surprisingly , was formally granted . A year or so later Vice President Cheney said on national television that Saddam Hussein was behind the attacks . The obvious untruth required a quick clarification from President Bush , whom Wilton saw on TV saying , "" We have no evidence that ties Saddam Hussein to . What the Vice President actually meant was . . . "" Wilton , who is no dummy , watched this aghast . He comes from the old school where the president walks on water , and "" if you can't trust the president , who CAN you trust ? "" The name of his dead son had been painted on a bomb that was dropped on a country against which there was no need for revenge . As propaganda , this is pretty well done . There isn't anything spectacularly innovative about it , although the story of the initial attacks on Baghdad by stealth bombers is interspersed through the film and builds up a sense of continuity . Both sides of the dispute are represented by talking heads and video clips . I'm unable to call them conservative or liberal , or right - or left wing , because those labels lie uneasily on the heads of the people who actively promoted the war and the rest of the civilized world . The techniques for discrediting the promoters , though , are clear and familiar . A talking head from the Project for a New American Century ( say , William Krystol ) makes a brief summary statement . And there follows a series of talking heads from the other side that dispute him point by point . ( Ho hum . ) Jarecki seems to divide the country into three parts . There's Dwight D . Eisenhower , who saw the military-industrial complex coming . There are the handful of people at the top who have governed the country from Eisenhower until now . And then there are the other 99 . 99 percent of us who are victimized by traditional propaganda techniques that shield us from what Jarecki sees as the truth . "" Glittering generalities "" is one such tactic . Why are we fighting "" them "" ( whoever they've been ) ? Because they are "" evildoers . "" Because we want to "" liberate "" them . Because we want to defend "" freedom and democracy . "" ( Interested parties can look up some other effective techniques at Disinfopedia . com , I think . ) Jarecki takes a materialist position in explaining why we seem to have been involved in so many wars lately , big and small , acting as the World's Policeman . It's because it's good for business . The film doesn't mention it but the current wave of job outsourcing is also good for business , if you're at or near the top of the ladder . Eisenhower's warning finally was repeated so often that it became desemanticized . And now there IS no military-industrial complex . The seams have disappeared and they are now one organizational entity - - a militaryindustrialcomplex . A revolving door exists between public service and the private sector . People shuffle back and forth almost at will . There's little separation between industry lobbyist and political personage . Richard Perle , one of the promoters , is right when he denies that the nation has been "" hijacked "" by a cabal of ideologues and that if we can only get rid of them , things will go back to the way they were . "" We can never go back to the way it was , "" says Perle . The building of a weapons system is as much a political process as a military one . Parts of the controversial B2 bomber are built in EVERY ONE of the 50 states , and it's the job of representatives to see that the largess keeps coming in . It's not just entirely legal , it's necessary if the official wants to be reelected . How else to account for the billions of dollars so far invested in the Raptor interceptor , a big new monstrously expensive airplane that can do everything except duplicate Donald O'Connor's dance number in "" Singin ' in the Rain "" ? Its only flaw is that it has no mission , since there are no bombers for it to intercept . Well , none of this material is particularly surprising , at least not to anyone who pays attention to the mainstream media and is open to diverse viewpoints . The chief difficulty with the film is that those who need most to see it will never do so . It doesn't have the folksy , popular appeal of Michael Moore's propaganda ( thank God ) . It has less innuendo and more thoughtful analysis . It DOES raise an interesting question though . Wilton Sekzer lost his son and enthusiastically endorsed the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent killing of tens of thousands of Iraqis , the vast majority of them innocent civilians . He wanted revenge , sure , but even if his assumptions about Hussein's guilt had been justified , why did he want to strike out at an entire nation and draw so MUCH blood ? I would ordinarily attribute this thirst for killing to the reptilian brain but I believe biological impulses can be overcome by cultural forces . Every time I'm ready to blame biology , something comes along that upsets my apple cart . After all , a few months ago , a stranger entered an Amish schoolhouse and unloosed a fusillade of bullets , killing a number of the children . He didn't know them or their families . He only chose the Amish school because it was the easiest to get into with a weapon . And what did the grieving Amish community do ? They quickly forgave the murderer . Then they invited the murderer's family to attend the kids ' funeral . Then they invited the murder's widow to join their sect !

A robbery that is somehow connected with the big top . Christopher Lee playing the hooded Russian lion tamer Gregor comes upon this suitcase of some 250 , 000 pound sterling in the deserted farm , where he keeps his wild animals caged . The cash was taken in the spectacular armored car robber on the London Bridge at the beginning of the movie . Gregor also finds the body of one of the robbers , who was killed , with a knife in his back , there too . Whoever planned the robbery had the money specifically brought there , the deserted farm house , on the circus grounds by one of his unwitting henchmen corrupt cop Mason , Victor Maddan , and then had him murdered to keep the cash all for himself . The rest of the film "" Circus of Fear "" has the unseen and unknown killer try to murder anyone who has any idea of who he is . That includes the cheating partner of the jealous and hot headed circus knife-thrower Mario ( Maurice Kaufmann ) Gina , Margaret Lee , as well as the not to on the ball and creepy person who's supposed to smuggle the stolen cash out to the country for the armored car robbery gang Manfred Hart , Klaus Kinski . With some of the stolen car robbery money being passed around the town where the circus is preforming it soon becomes evident to the Scotland Yard chief investigating this baffling case Elliott , Leo Genn , that the killer is somehow in the circus as a performer . This makes knife-thrower Mario the number one suspect . Going undercover as a news photographer Scotland Yard inspector Elliott zeros in on lion tamer Gregor and his pretty assistant Natasha , Suzy Kendall . We soon learn of the black-hooded Gregors , who's face was supposedly ripped to shreds by a wild lion , somewhat checkered past and how he may well be helping his recently escaped from prison brother Otto . Otto was convicted of killing the circus ' ring master's Carl , Heinz Drache , father . Gregor is also made to look very suspicious in the circus killings when we see that one of the circus performers Mr . Big , Skip Martin , is blackmailing the big hooded guy . This is done by Mr . Big in return for withholding information about Gregor from the police ! Just who really is this big and scary-looking guy anyway ? can he actually be the escaped killer Otto who's also a wild animal trainer like Gregor and just happens to be the father of Gregor's assistant Natasha ? Interesting twists and turns has you guessing just who the killer is and it takes a major mistake on the killers part . Or was it just his sick and arrogant attempt to gain publicity . In the end It was the killers own greed and vindictiveness in being given thankless menial and humiliating jobs by circus owner Barberini , Anthony Newlands , that made him go so insane and then take out his frustration and anger on everyone in the circus that he felt kept him from being the big star that he always envisioned himself to be . Planing the London Bridge armored car robbery and using the circus grounds to stash away the money after double-crossing and murdering both his fellow robbers Mason and Manfred the killer's subconscious desire to get attention is what eventually gave him away .

Text2: SPOILERS Probably the most influential of Mario Bava's Giallo thrillers "" Bay of Blood "" set the stage form the mid 1970's and beyond for scores of slasher movies that copied many of the scenes that Brava put into that film .

The camera slowly moves upwards from the killers shoes to where we finally she his face who turns out to be the Contess ' husband Count Donai Filippo ! Before you can catch your breath the Count is run through from behind with a blade leaving him to bleed to death as his dead wife whom he just murdered is hanging suspended over him . This all happens in the first ten minutes of the film without a single world of dialog ! The movie continues on it's gory way that when it's finally over practically everyone in it ends up brutally murdered . The plot , if you can call it one , of "" Bay of Blood "" has to do with a valuable piece of land on a bay that a number of people what to convert into a vacation resort with the owner Countess Fedenica refusing to sell it to them . This is what leads to the orgy of murder in the movie with everyone trying to get a hold of the land and not at all caring just what they have to do to get it . It's hard enough to follow the conniving and killing of those involved with the lake property but we have thrown into the mix , for what just seems to be a reason to jack-up the body count , a quartet of young people going down to the lake to have some fun . The first couple Brunhida and her boyfriend Robert separate from each other with Brunhida going skinny-dipping in the lake only to run , or bump , into the squid-eaten body of the murdered Count Filippo ! Running buff naked to the cabin where the other couple , Denise & Duke , and Robert are staying Brunhida is hacked to death by an unknown killer who pops out of nowhere . Robert is then quickly chopped in half by the off-camera psycho as he opens the cabin door expecting to see Brunhilda . Later both Denise and Duke totally oblivious to what's happening , as their both in bed doing it , get run through like a shish kebab with a spear by the same unknown killer . Everyone that were introduced to in the film get's brutally murdered in some of the most grizzly scenes even put into a movie , American or foreign , up until that time . There's scenes of strangling impaling knifing slashing and decapitating that by the time the final act of murder happens , a good old fashion shot-gun massacre , your just left too numb and dazed to even react to it ! The film "" Bay of Blood "" is so blood-splattered and off-the-wall that there's not even a mysterious killer that the audience could try to identify and figure out who he , or she , is . In that the killer finally reveals himself , due to process of elimination , since almost everyone who were murdered in the film had earlier ended up murdering somebody else making the point of the film being a whodunit totally moot . You really have to have both a strong , as well as empty , stomach to be able to sit through and watch "" Bay of Blood "" . The movie that more then any other horror film opened up the door to the wave of horror / slashers and Giallo horror / thrillers like "" Deep Red "" and "" Tenabre "" in Italy and "" Halloween "" and "" Friday the 13th "" .

They hire on as hands for pretty rancher Jenny Morgan ( Jennifer Holt ) , while Eddie tries to find out more about the outlaw that looks just like him . One tip for viewers , good guy Eddie - white shirt ; bad guy Tioga - black shirt . One wouldn't consider Dean to be one of the more physical cowboys , he seems slighter of build than most . That doesn't prevent him from having some of the wilder fist fights you'll see in a Western . Nothing in the vicinity is safe ; in this one a brawl in a bunkhouse takes out a wood stove , table and a bunk . Be attentive during a bar room battle when Dean , as Tioga , takes on town boss Joe Marino ( Dennis Moore ) ; one of Marino's henchmen hits him on the left side of the head with a bottle , but you'll see him grab the right side of his head as he goes down . It looks like Roscoe's Soapy character is a goner in this one , he gets shot off his horse by one of Marino's henchies , but it turns out he's only winged in the arm . One of Soapy's better lines in the film - "" Well I'll be the uncle of a prairie dog ! "" Dean's horse Flash is co-billed with Eddie at the start of the film , but did you know that he actually appeared with four different horses in his films ? Depending on the movie , you'll see him riding either War Paint , White Cloud , Copper or Flash . Eddie didn't want any of his horses upstaging him . Fans of Dean's singing voice won't be disappointed here , he does three original tunes written for the movie . "" Driftin ' River "" opens the film , followed later by "" Way Back in Oklahoma "" . After saving the day in the story , Soapy suggests that maybe Eddie and Jenny ought to hitch up , but his response in song says otherwise - "" Ain't No Gal Got a Brand on Me "" . For trivia buffs , Eddie Dean's real name was Edgar Dean Glosup .

Text2: The absurdist nature of the film doesn't hide the basic premise of the story - conformity to a herd mentality is to be resisted at all times if one is determined to remain an individual . The rampage of the rhinoceros ( es ) / rhinocerii ( ? ? ) may serve to distract the disengaged viewer , but if you're paying attention , you'll get it pretty clearly . Even Stanley ( Gene Wilder ) , seemingly immune to rhinocerization , in a way falls victim to his own brand of conformity - getting drunk on weekends to escape the fact that he ' can't get used to life ' . My question would be - where did Zero Mostel get the energy to pull off that rhinoceros transformation ? That was a pretty challenging and inspired piece of work . Can you just picture him over at the Bronx Zoo rhino pit evaluating the huge animal's every movement and idiosyncrasy ? They were all incorporated into that magnificent characterization that had to go on for a significant portion of the story . It seemed that even Wilder was entranced by the performance . As for Karen Black , I wonder whose idea it was for her to wear that front slit skirt to distract the audience ? Herd mentality at work , right ? It worked on me , along with those long , leggy shots in every imaginable contorted position . It's too bad she became a rhinoceros too , she had such promise . I had never heard of this movie before until spying the title on one of the cable channels today . The story description hooked me right off , leading me to schedule my day so I could catch it .

Text2: It is not as philosophical as DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY or as amusing as MIDNIGHT or EASY LIVING or as well done as an historical film KITTY , but THE MATING SEASON represents the last time that Mitchell Leisin got a good film with at least one first rate performance in it - that of the fourth lead , Thelma Ritter . Her role is that of the mother of John Lund . Lund is a junior executive in a mid-western firm owned by Larry Keating , and has owed all of his success as a result of his mother's sacrifices to get him a good education ( in New York University , of all places ) . Ritter did it alone ( Lund's father died of alcoholism years earlier ) . But to do it has taken a toll - her hamburger joint is foreclosed on at the start of the film , and she is not really happy about telling her son about this , especially as he has just met and married Gene Tierney , who is a more glamorous , and socially more classy type than Lund is used to . Still she comes to the apartment of Lund and Tierney . The latter is expecting people answering her advertisement for a cook and house keeper . Before Ritter can straighten out her misconception , Tierney hires Ritter for the job . She starts right in , and since that night there is a major party for Keating and the executives of Lund's firm ( including Keating's son , James Lorimer , as a particularly obnoxious snob ) , Tierney puts her to work immediately . The party is doing well until a double disaster occurs : Lorimer causes Keating to get covered by some food , and Lund discovers who is doing the first rate cooking they have been partaking in . Keeping quiet , but with a growing sense of fear of discovery , Lund watches for an opportunity to speak to Ritter . Meanwhile she helps to quickly clean up Keating , and to point out that he should wear a lighter type of suit for his appearance . It is the start of Keating taking a serious interest in Ritter . Despite what Lund wants , he never has any chance to straighten the error out . This is especially true when Tierney's obnoxious mother ( Miriam Hopkins ) shows up . To Hopkins a servant is useful but not to be heard ( except if speaking in the most respectful tones ) . Hopkins does not care much for Lund for his background , despite his attempts to earn a living to support her daughter ( whom he loves ) . And when she overhears and sees certain behavior at night , she is sure that her son-in-law is a sexual weirdo . The film is an interesting study in social climbing and snobbery . Lund wants to ascend to high executive position based on his abilities , and finds Lorimer gleefully standing in his way ( for personal reasons - he liked Tierney too ) . His hesitancy is partly due to circumstances , but also it is embarrassing to him to admit his mother was a professional cook . Hopkins is a scatterbrained twit , who has met some interesting people ( including Benito Mussolini ) and been asked to write her memoirs . The worst snob is Cora Witherspoon , as the wife of a businessman from Maryland who is interested in dealing with Keating's firm . She looks down upon people for laughing too loud ! In the end the ones who are least snobby are Keating ( who cant ' stand his son as a result ) , Ritter , and Tierney . Ritter has the best lines in the film , delivered in that wonderful understated , realistic way that was all her own . Hopkins , in comparison , is all flamboyance and pose , but makes the most of her histrionics . Tierney has two great moments telling off two characters for their character flaws , and Keating's dry wit nicely augments the roles of the others . Only Lund seems too stiff at times - about this time some of the naturalistic abilities he showed in TOO EACH HIS OWN and MISS TATLOCK'S MILLIONS and A FOREIGN AFFAIR began to fossilize into a personal stuffiness . But he too rises at the conclusion in a final confrontation to prove he is not a total snob . It was the best ensemble acting of the final Leisin films , even having a whiff of recognition from an earlier one ( some of "" Mona Lisa "" , first played in CAPTAIN CAREY , U . S . A . is played towards the end ) . Leisin had , reportedly , problems controlling Miriam Hopkins in the filming . Maybe , but the final result was still pretty good for all the trouble .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

When people get a taste of tainted blood they immediately become vampires . These vampires have huge fangs , piercing eyes ( neat makeup job ) , move FAST and tell plenty of bad jokes ( we got "" Nightmare on Elm Street "" to thank for that ) . The movie is by no means great . It was direct to video and it shows . The film is very grainy with bad sound too . Also they throw in a lesbian couple for no reason other than to show gratuitous female nudity . ( I'd LOVE to see a gay male couple in one of these films ) . The film does have a mix or black and white characters - - but they're all stereotypes . The family is heavily dysfunctional and all the black guys and woman are in gangs , swear constantly and always travel with guns . Still this film works . It IS scary and has tons of blood and gore ( I can't see how this got by with an R rating ) . There's also a very eerie atmosphere with plenty of shock cuts to keep you off balance .

Text2: India - the 1890's - the North-West Frontier . Precocious young Priscilla arrives with her widowed mother to live with the grandfather they've never met , a stern old Army Colonel . Gaining the nickname of Private WEE WILLIE WINKIE , the little girl quickly charms nearly everyone around her , including a tough Scots Sergeant . But it is her influence with the local bandit chief that portends the greatest impact on all their lives . This was arguably Shirley Temple's finest film . It is certainly her most lavish . Fox & director John Ford fashioned a mini-epic with great atmosphere and much to please family viewers . The detailed sets & huge cast of extras do the picture proud . Shirley is wonderful , as usual , in her own unique way , but this time she has a couple of co-stars that can hold their own with her . Victor McLaglen is every inch the embodiment of a bluff British sergeant - and well he should , given his real-life background as a boxing champion and Provost Marshal of Baghdad . Gruff & tender by turns , he gives an unforgettable performance . As Shirley's grandfather , marvelous old Sir C . Aubrey Smith gives another sterling portrayal as the archetype of the colonial officer class - crusty & domineering . The rest of the cast is equally enjoyable : Cesar Romero as the chieftain ; June Lang & Michael Whalen as Shirley's mother and her new lieutenant friend ( fortunately their romance is unobtrusive ) ; Willie Fung as the giggling , treacherous house boy ; and Constance Collier as the waspish wife of a brigade officer .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
441,"Text1: This was an amusing episode of the series ARE YOU BEING SERVED ? that concentrated on the possibility of promotion in Grace Brothers Department Store , the class system , sexism , and reading palms . Mr . Rumbold ( Nicholas Smith ) has heard that there will be an opening in the Board Room , and Rumbold may be up for that promotion . He tells this in confidence to Captain Peacock ( Frank Thornton ) , who will probably be named to Rumbold's middle management position as floor head . Peacock's position as floor walker will be up too , and soon both Mr . Grainger ( Arthur Borough ) and Mrs . Slocombe ( Mollie Sugden ) are vying for that position , only both are crestfallen to discover that Peacock does not favor either of them : Grainger is too old , and Slocum is a woman ( two points of view that are irritating to the two candidates ) . Peacock is also approached by Mr . Humphreys ( John Inman ) for the post . In the meantime Mr . Humphrey mentions at lunchtime that he can read palms and is pretty accurate . Peacock lets him read his palm , and he sees him climbing a ladder , but also sees him at Mrs . Slocum's feet . Later he reads Rumbold's palm and does find that his career will be effected by a "" t "" . Subsequently , these predictions do come true , though not in the way anyone can guess . The episode has some nice touches . For example , everyone in the store knows the reason why a member of the Board is leaving - it has to do with a three bottle a day problem . Also , the conclusion shows that trusting in fortune telling may be fine , but one should always remember there are many ways to foretell the future , and that the predictions one gets from any medium can be quite murky at best .

Text2: The Premature Burial is certainly a lesser entry in Roger Corman's "" Poe "" cycle , but even a lesser entry for this great series can be considered something of a minor horror classic , and that is exactly what The Premature Burial is . It is unfortunate , however , that the winning team of Roger Corman , Edgar Allen Poe and Vincent Price had to be split up , with the great actor sitting this one out . I'm sure that Price wasn't very pleased about it either , as this is about as ' Poe ' as you can get without actually being the man himself . It's well documented that Poe's favourite subject is that of being buried alive , and that is very much the central theme that runs through this movie , as our central character is obsessed with his fear of being buried alive , because of his father's catatonia , to the extent that he has built himself a tomb for him to be placed in when he finally dies . Aside from this central theme , Corman has dotted other Poe trademarks around the story , such as the theme of betrayal and even a cat trapped inside the walls of a building ! While the film lacks the great Vincent Price , his replacement , Ray Milland , doesn't do a bad job at all in the lead . Milland had already proved himself as an actor in films such as Billy Wilder's ' Lost Weekend ' , and he shows here why he's one of the A-cast . What he lacks , though , is Price's authority and commandment of the screen . Throughout the film , I couldn't help but wonder how the film would have been with Price in the lead instead of Milland . . . and while thinking that , I couldn't help but think it would have been better . My favourite aspect of this movie has got to be the stylishly foreboding atmosphere that Corman creates around his central story . The graveyard surrounding the house that the characters live in is lovingly decked out with masses of smoke , and the result , while slightly over the top , makes for a great treat for the eyes ! Typically for a Corman movie , this one has it's problems in the plot department . At times , the film slows down completely and while Corman never allows it to get boring , some sequences ; such as Milland's dream sequence , just go on too long . However , while this isn't as good as the likes of The Masque of the Red Death and The Fall of the House of Usher ; it's still a more than worthy entry in the series and comes with high recommendations !","{""output"": ""NO""}"

"" Cute "" probably would be the most apt description of this 1980's product , a harmless , effects and design driven "" Star Wars "" variation with a most likable cast .

Text2: Highly original 1980's cult classic has Emilio Estevez in one of his best early roles : new wave punk Otto , taken under the wing of veteran car repossessor Bud ( a truly excellent Harry Dean Stanton ) . Otto soon learns to love the life of a repo man . Meanwhile , a ' 64 Chevy Malibu with a nasty secret in the trunk is causing all sorts of trouble for all sorts of people . After a while , it ceases to make much sense , but if you're like me , you'll be so amused by what's going on you probably won't mind so much . It has a constant off-the-wall sensibility , combining a science-fiction plot involving extraterrestrial corpses with more earthbound , satirical and black comedy elements . The cast gives it extra value ; Sy Richardson , Susan Barnes , Fox Harris , Olivia Barash , Tom Finnegan , Richard Foronjy , and Vonetta McGee contribute substantially in supporting roles , with the inimitable Tracey Walter scoring strongly as the yardman Miller , whose philosophical ramblings are one of the highlights of the picture . The film moves at a very nice pace ( it certainly isn't at any time ever boring ) , and features a real cutting-edge soundtrack that is fun to listen to ( Iggy Pop composed the "" Repo Man "" theme ) .

Text2: You'll have to agree about one aspect of this movie ? these British scriptwriters sure knew how to think up appealing titles ! Look at this : blood + beast + terror ? Separately , these three words already make every horror lover slaver . Together , they form the title to a seemly indispensable horror film . Sadly , this is a very wrong perception . The Blood Beast Terror is not a vital British horror picture . Especially not compared to so many other titles from that era . Although the plot of this film features a few promising and creative aspects ( the still unknown universe of insects ! ) , it develops itself very slow and tediously . The twists near the end don't really offer any surprises or innovative elements . Certainly not if you're familiar with the more famous Hammer monster movies like ' The Reptile ' . Peter Cushing stars as a cop investigating murders that are seemly committed by a giant death's head moth . Dr . Mallinger ( Robert Flamyng ) and the stunningly beautiful female resident in his mansion are behaving suspiciously , so Cushing goes undercover in rural Britain . His cute daughter and a bug-worshiping nerd accompany him . There's absolutely no tension to detect in this film . Maybe that's partially due to the far-fetched plot , but I rather blame the tame directing-skills of Vernon Sewell and the truly limited depth of this film . The characters in ' Blood Beast Terror ' are weak and uninteresting , while the make-up effects are downright ludicrous . The transformation-sequences that turn wench into moth are really , really cheap ! And yes , I do keep in mind that the film is over 35 years old now . Even then , the special effects look stupid , mind you ! In the same year of 1968 , the production company ( Tigon Productions ) released ' The Witchfinder General ' starring Vincent Price . That film is at least a dozen times better and one of the most atmospheric movies I ever saw .

There are enough elements here that are too familiar to make the film itself more than ordinary . There's the fish-out-of-water concept , the mismatched-partners concept , the culture clash concept , and so on . It's true that the two protagonists are not terribly likable , but at least they do manage to get some laughs , and Schwarzenegger and Belushi do have an adequate amount of odd-couple chemistry . It's all entertaining enough ; director Walter Hill has been an action expert for about three decades now and at least he creates some competently staged fights and chase scenes . The supporting cast includes Peter Boyle , Belushi's gruff boss who isn't quite the stereotypical angry , yelling boss common to action films .

However , the psychologically unstable Brick ( Keith ) decides to do the heist for real and forces his buddy Al to go along with it . Brick saved Al's life in Korea , and Al doesn't feel he can refuse him , even though the plan now involves Kay . Though the end of the film had some excitement , the rest of it drags . The acting is adequate . Though the guys had served in Korea and entered college late , as far as I know , the Korean war lasted three years and not ten . With the exception of 29-year-old Mathews , the rest of the actors are in the 33-35 year-old range . Madison's career started out promisingly , but he became best known as Wild Bill Hickok on television and eventually made many Italian westerns ; physical ailments kept him from working often past 1975 - his last credit is 8 years before his death in 1996 . The other actors worked mainly in television except for the handsome Kerwin Mathews , who found career success in another type of film genre before his retirement circa 1978 .

How could anyone in his right mind could justify this silly film ? Contrary to all the praise all major film critics have bestowed on Heaven , it's completely hard to understand what they saw in it . Did we view the same film ? The whole plot is so far-fetched that even the great cinematography and look of the finished product can't save it . How could this woman , Phillippa , have been so stupid in trying to take revenge in her own hands , without regard of the consequences ? The whole idea that she's helped to get away with a crime is beyond comprehension . Cate Blanchett is a great actress , no doubt , but sometimes the roles she takes are bizarre , to say the least . This woman she portrays here is one of the worst characters she has played because she's an idiot who can't differentiate between good and evil . If she was going to take care of a nasty piece of business why not take care of that person directly , not involving innocent people , or leaving it go the wrong way , as it was the case ? The carabinieri of Giovanni Ribisi is another hard to digest character . His Italian , ( he's of Italian descent , isn't he ? ) is atrocious . He and Blanchett make the oddest couple in recent memory in a film . His participation on the story is far fetched beyond words . You can't believe the Italian law enforcement to be this inane and inefficient . Why did they cast this light weight actor in a role that was begging for a Stefano Accorsi or another of the current crop of young , talented actors from Italy ?

The underlying message is that if you're cool as Pillippa and Fillippo you can get away with murder and go directly to heaven .

The result result in funny situations where the Spaniards ' more affable character prove to be a winning card for them . Loneliness proves to be hard for the men as their spouses are so far . Martin has an involvement with the kind Hannah . Pilar , who has decided on her own to go to Switzerland to join her husband , has spent a year's worth of remittances from Martin in the apartment that she supposedly has bought , but in reality she was duped from an unscrupulous building agent . When Pilar arrives , she senses how her husband has been having an affair , but nothing much comes out of it when they find an apartment of their own . Their life takes a nice rhythm in their new adopted country . Years go by , and after Martin's father's death , they decide to go back home , a sad mistake for the whole family . Carlos Iglesias , who wrote , directed , and starred in this film , is someone new to us . His nostalgic look at what appears to be a biographic picture , has some great moments that reflect a bygone Spain , a poor country during the years where the action takes place . The film is a hymn to those men that went to make a living , living family and friends behind . It's clear Mr . Iglesias knows what he is talking about and what comes out in the film is a loving tribute to those men who sacrificed it all in order to help their impoverished families . The director , who plays Martin , has some good moments in the film , especially the beginning of his life in the new country . Javier Gutierrez is also quite appealing as Marcos . Nieves DeMedina , is seen as Pilar , in a touching performance . Isabel Blanco , who plays Hannah , was a surprise . "" Un franco , 14 pesetas "" proves the point that for some emigrants that try to go back home find it almost impossible to adapt themselves to a pace and an atmosphere in the old country that seems alien to them now , as it's the case with Martin's son who can't adapt himself to the Spanish ways . These people have invested a lot of their lives in a new culture and adapted with a lot of effort , so going back is not exactly easy for most of them . Leaving comforts for an uncertain life back home is not something most of these families would even consider .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
453,"Text1: You have to feel sorry for anybody who tries to write the screenplay for a submarine movie . How is it possible to avoid all the established clichés ? The shattered chronometer , the bursting pipe , the ritual commands , the toy submarine nosing through the murk , the wounded skipper lying on the deck and ordering the boat down , the periscope slicing the sea , the tin can approaching at high speed , the pinging sonar gear , the tense sweaty faces , the walloped camera as the depth charge explodes , the conflict between the CO and the Exec , the playful bantering of the crew , a down-the-throat shot . Added to that are the problems that any Navy movie has . The men have no chance at individual heroism and practically none of being dramatically wounded . ( Unless one of them gets appendicitis or has a torpedo fall on him , which happens from time to time . ) Basically , the crew are there for comic purposes , so the burden of the drama must fall on the officers . The question can never be about who is going to rush out with his tommy gun and save the rest of the patrol , so it can only be about whose judgment is correct , the skipper or one of his officers . ( Sometimes a romantic conflict on the beach is thrown in , but that's rather arbitrary , kind of like the appendicitis patient . ) This one isn't too bad , as sub movies go , but it arrives late in the post-war genre . Nobody in it is weak . The enemy is dehumanized , the dialogue trite and exhausted , the action scenes shot on the cheap , and the story is twisted , hard to follow , and sometimes pointless . ( Example , midway through the movie a great deal is made of Captain Reagan's having brought back an accurate chart of the Japanese mine fields , but when the subs are sent out en masse it turns out the mines have been moved around so the chart is now irrelevant . ) The performers do as well as they can under the circumstances , although Nancy Reagan is definitely in the wrong part here . The right parts would have been those taken by the elderly Bette Davis . The cast has a lot of familiar faces , but none of them memorable because of their having given good performances elsewhere , only memorable because we've seen them so often before . The director should be spanked . A man is knocked about during a depth charge attack and is taken to sick bay . After he's been treated and bandaged up , there are still trickles of blood down his chin and the side of his face . Once winces at such sloppiness . And there is another painfully staged scene , when Reagan and Davis are saying good-bye . Davis's face is in the foreground . She stares unblinkingly just to the left of the camera's lens while Reagan stands behind and speaks to her over her shoulder . This particular part of cinematic grammar must antedate cinema itself . Should you see it ? Well - - why not . It's a historical curiosity if nothing else .

Text2: On a tour of America , Charles Dickens met Edgar Allan Poe . It couldn't have been much of a conversation . One writer was maybe the most effective speller of psychological nightmares who ever lived , and the other was an advocate of the poor and a fighter against social inequity . The psychologist and the sociologist . I never read Dickens ' novel which , if this movie is at all faithful , follows Davie Copperfield from his infancy through his young manhood . There are romantic mismatches and tragedies and a bit of comedy along the way . ( But the film , out of necessity , omits the most famous line from the novel . If I remember it correctly , it's , "" If that is the law , sir , then the law is a ass . "" ) That line comes from Mr . Bumble . But maybe the most memorable character is Mr . Micawber , on whom a few comments may be lavished . First of all , what a great name , especially for a clown . Micawber is haunted by debt and is constantly on the run from his creditors while trying to support a large family . W . C . Field , dressed in formal clothes several sizes too small for him , is perfect in the part . "" Godfrey Daniels ! "" , he exclaims in one of his other films . Is that very far removed from , "" Shades of Nicodemus ! "" in this film ? When we are introduced to Micawber we see him returning home . He spots his doorway clogged with creditors and makes an abrupt about face , sneaking around until he is able to climb through a window into his flat . His family crowd around him and applaud his entry . "" I have avoided the scurrilous machinations of our enemies ! "" he announces . "" In short - - I have arrived . "" The line doth roll trippingly from his tongue . His casting as Micawber was stroke of genius on somebody's part , but then all the casting is fine . The actors , the characters , and the names all suit one another . Edna May Oliver as Aunt Bitsy , sensible and no nonsense , and with that strangest of long prim faces . Basil Rathbone as Mr . Murdstone ( pronounced "" Murd-stun "" ) , the cold-hearted sadistic stepfather . Mr . Dick looks right but is more daft than amusing . Uriah Heap ( great name ! ) , the fawning and evil hypocrite , played by Roland Young . Perhaps only the people who play Davie himself , at whatever age , are a bit bland . The story contrasts two personality types that William James called the tough minded and the tender minded . Mr . Murdstone represents the tough minded - - discipline , authoritarianism , punishment . ( How his eyes gleam as he swats his palm with the switch that is about to be applied to Davie's bottom . ) Peggotty represents the opposite , the always nurturing , always loving maid who , in the end , is as helpless to change things as Mr . Murdstone . The real heroin is Aunt Bitsy , who is tough on the outside and tender on the inside , like a breaded veal cutlet . A lot of subplots crop up . Maureen O'Sullivan , Tarzan's succulent and uninhibited mate of a few years earlier , is a dotty but loving wife who dies at a convenient time . ( There are a couple of other deaths , all tragic because the deceased were fundamentally good people . ) The clever and aristocratic Steerforth breaks up a happy engagement and runs away with a young working girl and ruins her . Those subplots are part of what is maybe an unavoidable problem . They're squeezed into the plot so that the movie must rush along and spell things out like a Classic Comic version of Dickens ' novel . Even the music supports the hasty narrative . The score is what used to be called "" mickey mouse "" music because it resembles that of a cartoon . If somebody drinks out of a mug , the score matches the tempo of his Adam's apple - - glug glug glug . A shot of a cute little doggie is accompanied by a dozen sobbing violins . I can't imagine how this problem could be overcome , giving the main plot and each subplot its due attention . Maybe it can't be done . The best compromise between the demands of the two-hour movie and the prolix Dickens ' novel may be Lean's "" Great Expectations , "" although I always enjoy "" A Christmas Carol "" too . The problem is a real one . Just look at the whole title of this novel . "" The Personal History , Adventures , Experience , and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger . "" And is this the same novel that opens with the line - - "" Chapter One . I am born . "" ? I mean , you can see the difficulty . That being said , the movie does run its course cleanly and Cukor the director doesn't linger over any scenes to the point of pain . It's a bit too much like a soap opera in some respects but I was caught up in it this time and rather enjoyed it .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Pierce Brosnan , Geoffrey Rush , Jamie Lee Curtis , Brendan Gleeson and Catherine McCormick are all actors I find interesting so I enjoyed watching them and this film , in general . My only objection was the normal Liberal bias , here making George Bush , the British and the Americans look pushy and obnoxious in their dealings to control the locks .

456,"Text1: I think I liked Child's Play 2 more than most people , given the reviews that I've read and the movie's low voter rating on the IMDb . A cute kid's doll is once again the unlikely home of Charles Lee Ray , notorious serial killer , again feeding off of the surrealism created by seeing a kid's doll screw it's face into expressions of the purest rage and spouting all manner of profanities . By now , Ray is becoming more and more desperate to get out of the body of the doll , because as we were informed in the first film , if he spends too much time in that body he'll gradually become more and more human until one day he'll be stuck in it forever . Needless to say , Ray's a lot more interested in starting life over as a 6-year-old ( and who wouldn't ? ) rather than spending the rest of his life as a plastic doll . Although , given that he becomes more human the longer he is in that body , how human will he eventually become ? Will he ever reach full human-hood ? My guess is that he'll gradually approach being a real human being in a sort of half life , where he gets closer and closer and closer but never actually gets there , kind of like computer generated actors . There is currently much talk about how close computers can ever get to animating convincingly real people into the movies , and the leading theory seems to be something akin to my theory of Chucky turning human . He'll always get closer but he'll never get all the way there . At any rate , Andy's mother has landed in a mental institution and Andy has been taken in by a foster family with appropriate mental vacuity to be a horror movie surrogate family . When Andy becomes frightened and runs through the house , his foster father grabs him and says , ' Rule # 1 , no running in the house ! ' OK , ' dad , ' but not even when I open a closet and find myself confronted by the doll that landed my mom in the nuthouse and almost cost me my life and my very soul ? My God , man , what the hell is this guy doing with a Good Guys doll in the house in the first place ? It's difficult enough trying to figure out why it's even there WITHOUT having to watch this mental giant grab Andy by the arm and ask him what on earth is the matter . There are some funny moments in the film , such as when Chucky smashes the head of the innocent Good Guys doll , buries it , and takes its place in the house , and my favorite , when Chucky is later addressed by a doting adult , Chucky responds by saying in his cute doll voice , ' Hi ! I'm ? . Tommy ! ' The stockholders in the Play Pal corporation are distressed over the suffering that the company has endured due to the negative publicity of the events of the first movie provide the premise for the movie's rather impressive finale . In order to generate a more positive image for the company and the doll , they have decided to reintroduce it into the market . The original Chucky doll was collected by the company and examined by toy-makers , who decided that there really was nothing truly wrong with it , it was not really a demon-possessed toy , so they decided to melt it down and remake it . Why they didn't just throw it away I'm not really sure , but who cares . Waste not , want not , I guess . At any rate , Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body ( too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another ) , and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul . I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something , but you'll remember in the first movie , the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll . Jarrett Friend , writing for HorrorWatch , made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation , but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls , since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie . This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality ; my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big . Nevertheless , even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story , Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels , kind of like Psycho II , which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence . I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2 , but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting , if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape . There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film , not including , however , the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost , making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so . A bit trite , but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film , which is the final scene , one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie . Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene . I do , however , think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got . I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits . What do you think the IMDb is for ?

Text2: Prolific director Jess Franco made a lot of crap during his career , but in his filmography there are several hidden gems - and Faceless is definitely one of them ! True to Franco's style , the film is trashy and sleazy throughout , but it's the eighties atmosphere that sets this film apart from the majority of Franco's opus , as Faceless takes in trashy eighties pop and themes of vanity , which ensure that the film is always obviously a product of the eighties . The story has been used many times before - mostly in films made in the sixties ; films such as Eyes Without a Face , Circus of Horrors and Franco's own The Awful Dr Orloff ( which gets a nod in this film ) , but never before has this sort of been given as much blood , gore and nudity as it gets in Faceless . The film begins with the disappearance of a model named Barbara Hallen . Her father hires a private detective to find her , and while on her trail in Paris ; the detective eventually makes his way to a private clinic where strange experiments have been going on . The not so good doctor has a woman whose face he wants to fix - and he's using skin from young women to do it ! The film's biggest plus point has to go to the scenes of gore ! Sequences that see things such as a needle in the eye , a drill through the skull , a chainsaw decapitation and numerous surgery sequences are well done , and bound to delight gore fans . The cast is also a standout element of the film , as Franco recasts Howard Vernon in the role of Dr Orloff , and we've also got performances from the likes of Telly Savalas , Anton Diffring and Jean Rollin's beautiful frequent collaborator , Brigitte Lahaie . The story isn't massively strong , but it's not bad either as Franco strings a few different threads together and that , along with the gore and skin going on throughout , tends to ensure that the film is always interesting . The music that Franco has chosen is good in that it suits the style and feel of the film , but Franco uses the central song a bit too often , and it starts to grate after a while . Overall , Faceless might not do much for fans of serious films , or for those that dislike Jess Franco in general ; but Faceless is one of the better films that the director has worked on , and comes recommended to the right sort of people .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
457,"Text1:  Dr . Giggles  is an engaging , tongue-in-cheek slasher that derives great dark humor out of unauthorized surgery . Evan Rendell ( Larry Drake ) , yearning to be a doctor just like his old man , escapes from a mental hospital and sets up his macabre clinic in the old family home in Moorehigh . As he performs his lethal operations on the citizens , he learns that unhappy teen Jennifer ( Holly Marie Combs of ' Charmed ' fame ) has a heart ailment and is determined to provide her with a new heart . Thankfully , there are plenty of unwilling donors available . This is a fun 90's era slasher . It's a slick , glossy film with impressive cinematography ( by Robert Draper ) and efficient pacing that doesn't let up until the end . The cast is way above average for this sort of thing : Cliff De Young plays Jennifer's loving father , Michelle Johnson the younger woman he has taken up with since his wife's death , Richard Bradford the veteran cop with a disturbing secret to tell , Keith Diamond his understandably perturbed younger partner , Nancy Fish the grumpy middle-aged neighbor , and the late Glenn Quinn as Jennifer's unfaithful but still basically decent boyfriend . They're all fine , but Drake offers a delightful star performance as the unhinged doc . His dialog largely consists of popular one - liners associated with doctors and the medical profession , and they're used to great effect . The film has some rather stylish touches . The moving camera and the angles are well done , with two standout sequences coming to mind . The first is a suspense sequence in a carnival funhouse , where co-writer / director Manny Coto makes good use of the multiple mirrors . The second is a memorable sequence involving a young Rendell and his mother's dead body . The film has no shortage of victims for Rendell to claim , so slasher fans can take pleasure in a high body count . KNB does a typically solid job in the makeup effects department . One of the brightest , funniest moments comes when Rendell passes by a young boy playing his video game with glassy-eyed obsession , and does no more than mutter , "" Terminal "" . "" Dr . Giggles "" offers a generous dose of silly , agreeable slasher fun for an amusing 95 minutes that pretty much fly by .

As in "" The Daffy Doc "" two years earlier , an excessively eager physician tries to operate on Porky ( in the earlier one , it was doctor wannabe Daffy Duck ) . Having seen many of Porky's cartoons from his debut until the US entered WWII , one can see that the studio usually cast Porky in rather sedate , pedestrian roles : fireman , pilgrim , bullfighter . Therefore , this one was pretty much representative of the era . "" You Ought to Be In Pictures "" may have been the one exception . Porky's roles got really cool once Chuck Jones started directing him regularly after WWII , frequently casting him as a foil to Daffy's craziness . Anyway , this one isn't bad .

In the middle of this the highly professional cinematography of Benjamin Kline is occasionally jarringly beautiful and dramatic , particularly when he moves the camera to preserve composition .

460,"Text1: Wargames is one of those young adult films that manages to span just about all ages of movie fans with its sense of adventure mixed with a chilling sense of reality . Kind of like The Goonies , it is a movie that finds a young kid in an extraordinary situation , except that rather than the Indiana Jones type adventure that the Goonies go on , David ( a young Matthew Broderick ) has inadvertently come frighteningly close to starting a massive nuclear war between the United States and Russia . We meet David early in the film after a tense missile launch training sequence ( in which the men on hand do not realize that they are only participating in a training drill ) . David is a typical high school boy , bored to death by school but fascinated to no end by computers , even the now-prehistoric dinosaur that he had operating at home . One of the things that I liked about this movie , in fact , was that it made my computer look so high tech ! Obviously , any movie that deals with computers is going to be outdated in a few years , and Wargames is certainly no exception . Consider , for example , the fact that David's girlfriend was so fascinated by the concept of a speaker that she picked it up and looked at it from all angles , completely amazed . You can see this in any number of movies , such as the similarly ancient computers in Weird Science and , probably the most amusing , the massive , brick-sized cellular telephone that Wesley Snipes used in true gangster style in New Jack City . Technology is an amusing thing , especially when it's taken so seriously in the movies and then is so completely obsolete a decade or so later . Wargames , however , despite being jam-packed with outdated machinery and computer technology , is no less potent as a military thriller , because the technology is not the point of the film . Instead , the movie tells the story of how David goes searching for video games on the 1983 version of the Internet , only to accidentally stumble upon a top-secret military database , WOPR ( endearingly referred to as ' Whopper ' ) that runs hypothetical sequences of what World War III would look like , including how the Russians would react to American reactions to their actions , and so forth . The process by which this machine can do this is one of the few things that's left relatively unclear in the movie , which is probably a good thing , because it sounds suspiciously like something that a computer even today would have a hard time doing . Imagine the staggering amount of information that would have to be entered into a computer for it to achieve that level of intelligence . At any rate , wanting nothing but some new video games and to impress a girl , David searches for video games on what appears to be the web's only search engine ( and , indeed , it's only feature at all ) , and stumbles onto such titles as Backgammon , Chess , Guerrilla Warfare and , of course , Global Thermonuclear War . Naturally , being a high school kid , he's fascinated and wants to play the biggest baddest one . Probably the most hair-raising scene in the film is when David's mother calls him downstairs and congratulates him on passing his classes ( which he had changed by hacking into the school's computer system ) , by which he is thrilled until he turns to look at the TV , where the news is reporting the war that has been set in motion because of his tinkering on the computer . Wargames requires a substantial suspension of disbelief because of such things like the United States military's inability to tell whether or not those blips coming from Russia on their screens are real weapons of mass destruction of if they're just a computer game , but the fact that the world is tottering so lightly on the edge of Global Thermonuclear War , even if only because of the very presence of these types of weapons , is the frightening concept that the movie tries to get across . It focuses on the possibility that something like that could have happened , and it rings chillingly true to this day , no matter how much more advanced our technology is . Sure , it's not likely that the governments of the United States and of Russia or any other countries are likely to launch weapons that will kill millions of people simply based on a few lights that have lighted up on their switchboard , but the weapons are there , and someone paid a lot of money for them . Wargames is an enormously entertaining thriller that poses a question about humanity , with the answer from WOPR that , like Tic Tac Toe , there is no winning move in war . We see it playing through World War III on the military intelligence screens near the end of the film ( during which it evidently has a field day messing with the lighting in the room ) showing missiles coming from every direction and destroying everything on the map . ' This is a strange game , ' it says . ' The only winning move is not to play . How about a nice game of chess ? '

A liquor store cashier ( Cheadle again ) mistakenly rings up $10 when a young girl really only paid with $1 , she doesn't say anything and walks out of the store wide-eyed , and bingo , he disgustedly pays back the difference out of his pocket , and no prize for her . This part of the story is never explained very well , and this guy pops up in some strange places without any explanation . The rest of the movie was actually pretty good . When Campbell gets a look at what he could have had , his initial fear and dislike is eventually eroded away as he begins to like what life is like when he has someone who he loves and who loves him . The most entertaining part of the movie comes from watching him , first of all , doing what he does as the arrogant rich business executive , and most of all , watching him try to get used to the fact that his entire life has been changed , albeit temporarily , literally overnight . Nicholas Cage's charm really comes through in some great scenes as he adapts to the middle class life , as opposed to the upper upper class life , such as when he's going through his poor self's closet to find a jacket ( ' Oh , this is just sub-par . ' ) . That's some funny stuff . As far as the romance goes , yeah it's pretty prevalent , especially in the second half of the film , but for the most part it's not too exaggerated , and when you see what goes on between Campbell and his wife , Kate ( Leoni ) it's not too hard to see why he began to have conflictions about going back to his old life , full of money and empty sex . Don't be put off just because Nicholas Cage is in The Family Man and he always gets a little awkward in romantic roles , because this is definitely one of his better ones .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: As Fellini's "" 8 "" was a reflection of his own torment as a director , "" The 400 Blows "" was Francois Truffaut's exorcism of personal demons . Antoine Doinel is allegedly Truffaut's own projection of himself at an early age , and this movie was a very important project for the director as an adult . Jean-Pierre Léaud plays Antoine remarkably well , as a thoughtful but rebellious Parisian student who skips school and goes to the movies with his friends . His mother ( Claire Maurier ) shows no interest in the boy , nor does his father . He retreats home every day sullenly and sits on his bed , daydreaming . Beautifully filmed and still poignant after all these years , Truffaut's masterpiece is a moving and engaging study of youth that continues to retain its significance today . Definitely worth seeing , perhaps even worth buying if you're a film buff . The Criterion Collection DVD is excellent and provides a very insightful glimpse into both the movie and Truffaut .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
462,"Text1: Completely UNlike expected , I didn't like this creatively titled movie as much as I thought I would . "" The Night Evelyn Came out of the Gave "" features all the basic ingredients that make Italian horror fanatics ' mouths water , and it is in fact pretty good , yet it doesn't leave you with that fantastic feeling of total amazement like so many other gialli / Gothic films do . What went wrong mainly ? Well , one too many tedious sequences , for starters , but primarily it's the fact that justice apparently must NOT be done ! There's more than one murderer in this story and they honestly don't all get the punishment they deserve . The rest of the film is varying from good to great ! Director Emilio Miraglia offers a largely compelling giallo-plot , but with the atmosphere & set pieces of a typical Gothic horror production ! This means we're following a convoluted and demented crime conspiracy but set in an ancient ominous castle and featuring eerie family vaults , whips and gigantic cobwebs . Two years later , in 1973 , the great Antonio Margheriti also proved with "" Seven Deaths in a Cat's Eye "" that these two fabulous horror sub genre's can be blend perfectly . And he did it even slightly better , as that particular film didn't suffer from so many holes in the plot . The wealthy Lord Cunningham has the strange habit of luring red-headed beauties to his castle , suffering from a vision of another redhead running naked through a meadow , and subsequently killing the gals barbarically with a whip . This ritual describes his therapy for getting over his wife's death , since she passed away shortly after him ( falsy ? ) accusing her of adultery . When the Lord finally takes everyone's advise and re-marries with a stunning beauty , all kinds of mysterious events occur , indicating that the first wife returned from the dead with a vengeance . Hence the not-so-subtle title ! The story is always interesting but the pacing is a little slow and not one character is likable . However , that makes the murders all the more enjoyable ! They're not particularly gory , but certainly ingenious ! The killing of the wheel-chaired lady is notably brutal ! The music and quantity of nudity & euro-sleaze are also tip top , so there are more than enough elements left to reward this film with a positive rating .

Text2: What arguments do you use to recommend "" The Baby "" to any fan of peculiar cult & horror cinema who's convinced that she / he has already seen everything before ? Well , let's try this : "" The Baby "" is horrific without reverting to gory massacres or nauseating make-up effects , it's extremely disturbing even though the premise is far-fetched and totally implausible and ? last but definitely not least ? there's an unpredictable twist at the end that you simply have to see in order to believe it ! This is one of the most original low-budget exploitation movies of the 70's , and it's truly remarkable how writer / director Ted Post managed to make such a fascinating film out of such a demented basic premise ! "" The Baby "" starts out as the portrait of a dysfunctional family , but it gradually transforms into an atypical and thematic horror film with an uncanny atmosphere and frighteningly insane characters . Ann Gentry , a professional social worker in her mid-30's , takes an interest in the odd family situation of the Wadsworths . The mother lives alone with her two adult daughters and ? Baby ! Baby is a fully-grown 21-year-old male , but his mother and sisters treat him as an infant and claim that he's mentally unable to function as a mature human being . Ann is convinced that the crazy women deliberately prevent Baby from developing normally , presumably because they don't want him to grow like the careless and obnoxious men who abandoned them in the past . She quickly reverts to unorthodox methods in her attempts to rescue Baby and risks losing both her job and her life . Especially considering the cinematic era "" The Baby "" was made , and also the low-budget production values , the basic concept of the film easily could have resulted in a trashy and ultimately perverted B-movie . Imagine ; a grown man in a diaper surrounded by overly protective and deranged women ! In the hands of certain other directors , say , Doris Wishman or Russ Meyer , "" The Baby "" unquestionably would have been a non-stop series of sleazy images and shocking sex-rites , but Ted Post approaches the unusual subject matter very professionally and tasteful . There are only two controversially uncomfortable sequences , one involving a teenage babysitter and the other one being the fabulous climax . Ted Post maintains an ominous atmosphere , the Wadsworth women are downright creepy characters and the whole thing is just delightfully man-unfriendly ! Fans of graphic bloodshed and gore may be a bit disappointed , but the horrific themes of the film are definitely unique enough to compensate . Literally ALL the acting performances are splendid , but David Mooney deserves extra praise for his credible and undoubtedly complex depiction of Baby . It may not be Citizen Kane , but I guarantee that The Baby will be one of the most unforgettable and curiously engaging films you'll ever see .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The killer who's father Charles Manning was Clark's assistant and good friend in the British colony of Kimberly in Africa , where Clark was the district governor , was murdered by Clark who stole over 6 million in pound sterling worth of uncut diamonds that his father had . What the killer doesn't seem to know is that Clark is really his father , which was brought out at the end of the movie . But there seems to be some disconnect here with the killer when it's revealed that he came upon a batch of love letters by Clark to his mother Bettie Manning that he found hidden in the castle ! the guy couldn't put two and two together ? Early in the movie we see that Clark is having the stolen diamonds cut by his creepy butler Anthony , Dieter Eppier , who used to be an expert diamond cutter until he was sent up the river for five years for stealing diamonds from his employer . Clark is secretly sending the diamonds hidden in cigar tubes to the owner of the "" Old Scavenger Inn "" in London Mr . Travish , Hands Nielson , who's fencing the hot diamonds by paying Clark in cash for them . What both Clark and Travish as well as Clark's lawyer Mr . Tromby , Richard Haussler , doesn't know is that the killer has someone working at the "" Old Scavenger Inn "" , his wife , who's tipping him off about the transactions . At one point in the movie he ambushes Clark's delivery man with the diamonds who happens to be his gardener Sebastian , Albert Bessler , killing him and taking the stones . What the cagey Clark is doing is getting rid of the diamonds so that the killer can't get his hands on them and giving the money that he gets from Travish to his niece Claridge Dorsett , Karin Dor , as stated in his will on or after her 21th birthday . The masked killer is determined to get the diamonds or the money that Clark gets for fencing them before she does even if it kills her . Interesting German 1963 import that has you guessing to who the killer is until he's dredged out of the swamp outside Blackmoor Castle at the end of the movie and his identity reveled . "" Strangler of Blackmoor Castle "" is a bit too violent for movies released back then in those days in the early 1960's with a number of shocking and bloody decapitations that are really gruesome even watching the movie now . The film does have some comic relief in it with the lord of the castle Lord Blackmoor , Hans Reiser , spending all his time listening and recording on his portable tape recorder bird love calls in the woods .

Text2: SPOILERS Let me invite you for a stroll down "" Graveyard Lane "" so starts the movie as were introduced to R . J . Dobson the custodian of the Raven Hill Cemetery . Dobson tells the audience about the secrets of the cemetery by saying : Each marker , tombstone , withholds many stories some filled with happiness some filled with sorrow . I wonder what they would do if they had the chance to re-live their lives again ! What would you do ? All of a sudden Dobson stops his monologue and starts calling for his cat Pumha . Walking through the graveyard after accidentally stepping on the cats tail he finds the kitty at the headstone of Lewis B . Moffitt a medical student who died at the age of 22 in 1955 , and so the story begins . Lewis B . Moffitt wanted to become a doctor for all the wrong reasons . As a young boy he developed a fear of the dark when his grandpa died and was left to lay in state in his parents living-room . Terrified of the dark his mother told him that if he turned on the lights his grandpa would get out of his coffin and whack him . As Lewis grew up he wanted to become a doctor to overcome his fear of dead bodies like the fear he had of his grandpa when he was laying in state . What he liked to do most at the medical collage was to participate in dissecting of human bodies . Most of the students who were in the gallery watching these dissecting would get sick and leave the room but not Lewis he was fearless . A body that was dissected just before there was to be an initiation into the collage fraternity had a gold ring on it . At the initiation the next night Lewis was told that he had to go into the Raven Hill Cemetery Mausoleum where they keep the recently interred and bring the gold ring back to be accepted into the fraternity . Going into the cemetery that night Lewis finally makes it into the mausoleum and finds the body with the gold ring that he was looking for . As Lewis was about to get the gold ring off the finger of the body he hears a shriek of what turned out to be the custodians cat Pumha and as he turned in surprise the dead mans hand fell and grabbed Lewis . All of a sudden the fear that Lewis suppressed all these years since he was a little boy of the dark and dead bodies came back to him like a bolt of lighting and he fell to the ground dead , dead of fright . So ended the story of Lewis B . Moffitt the young man who tried to show that he can take the fear of being around dead bodies by ending up dead because of one . By the way on Moffitt's headstone was carved out the epithet "" I FEARED NOT "" . Far better then you would expect from the down right awful rating the movie has from the IMDb voters . "" Ring of Terror "" plays like one of those 1950's mystery / suspense shows like "" Inner-sanctum "" and "" Strange stories "" and is much better then most "" Twilight Zone "" episodes that I've seen . "" Ring of Terror "" did have an interesting story that didn't need any special effects and the acting was surprisingly good especially George Mather who played Lewis B . Moffitt .

"" El dia de la Bestia "" was made in Spain , or the new great home of horror these days . Spanish directors proved themselves a lot lately and I think this guy , Alex De La Iglesia , deserves some extra credit . This guy obviously is a big lover of horror and the whole cult atmosphere around it .

To avoid this horrible event that would mean the end of the world , he has to face Satan himself . So , he travels to Madrid and commits a lot of sins , which is pretty funny to watch .

It wouldn't do much if I named all the actors of this movie because their names don't ring a bell . But , I can say they're all very good actors and they clearly did their best work in this film . Like I said before , this film contains a lot of humor but it never spoofs the genre . There's always a lot of respect present and I think that's a great achievement . Also , I would have thought there was a lot more gore in this film . To my surprise , the gory scenes are very limited and overall short . Gorehounds be advised because the cover and the title may make you think it's one big blood fest . Good film , nice change , great fun . . . highly recommended if you need a break from all the typical nowadays slasher-films .

Text2: The first thing that impressed me about this - I saw it earlier today on TV - was how well it stands up after exactly 50 years . Whichever way you look at it 1947 was something of a bumper year for Gadg ; he directed both Arthur Miller's All My Sons and Tennessee Williams ' A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway and as if that weren't enough he shot Sea Of Grass , Gentlemen's Agreement and Boomerang all in one year . One could b forgiven for thinking that Gadg had something of a Repertory company going ; Arthur Kennedy , cast as the innocent suspect John Waldron here , was playing Chris Keller in All My Sons and would play Biff Loman two years later in Death Of A Salesman , also directed by Gadg , whilst the original Willy Loman Lee J . Cobb ( who had acted with Gadg in the Group Theatre on Broadway ) was cast here as the Chief of Detectives and Karl Malden , the original Mitch in Streetcar ( a role he would repeat and again under Gadgs ' direction in the film version ) played a detective . This semi-documentary benefits from strong performances right across the board and even Jane Wyatt in the somewhat thankless role of devoted wife brings lustre to the part . From lead actor Dana Andrews through those already mentioned to Ed Begley as a corrupt businessman the cast turn in some fine ensemble acting and this is one I'd definitely buy on DVD .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
467,"Text1:  Magic Town  is a film about something that we nowadays take as normal but which was a novelty in 1947 . It was about the new "" science "" of public opinion polling . This was only understood poorly and not only by the public but by those who actually mattered : the politicians who would grow to need them . In 1936 the Literary Digest , a popular magazine of the day , had conducted a poll of it's membership on who would win the Presidency . It concluded that Governor Alfred Landon of Kansas , a capable man , would beat incumbent President Franklin Roosevelt . Unfortunately the readership of the Digest were upper class , and basically Republican ( as Landon was ) . In November 1936 FDR won one of the biggest landslides in political history , with three quarters of the popular vote and all the electoral votes except for those of Maine and Vermont . Literary Digest went out of business shortly afterwords . In the decade since Roper and Gallup had been improving polling techniques , but the full system was still uncertain . In the 1948 election there would be another polling snafu , with most of the polls awarding the election to Governor Thomas Dewey of New York , as opposed to incumbent President Harry Truman . Harry won a remarkable come-from-behind over Tom , and enjoyed showing off a headline from the Republican "" Chicago Tribune "" saying that Tom won . In the midst of all this there was a classic sociology study entitled "" Middletown "" . Set in the typical mid-American town ( it was in the Midwest ) the authors ( a husband and wife team ) showed how it's citizens opinions mirrored what mid-America believed . Ten years later the same authors published a follow up study of the town , and it turned there was little change in the opinion differentials between the town and the country . It is with the "" Middletown "" study that the background of this film was based . Jimmy Stewart and his assistants ( including Ned Sparks and Donald Meek - in his last role ) are pollsters , and Stewart has a theory he has been working on that would save pollsters millions . He believes there is a perfect community in the middle of America that can be used for polling it's citizens . He has been studying the problem for several years , and he has found a town where the percentages of the opinions of the citizens perfectly mirror those of the American people as a whole . Stewart goes to the town and sets up there with the intention of using the citizens as his poling guinea pigs , but ( as the movie progresses ) he gets involved with Jane Wyman and the others in the town . When Wyman discovers Stewart's plans she reveals them , and the town goes crazy . Their sudden unofficial power goes to their heads , and instead of giving the sensible polling answers to questions they give outlandish ones . This causes the crash of their reputation , and the crisis of the film . It is a first rate film and has some nice touches ( including Gabriel Heater intoning on the radio ) . As an early story regarding the polling industry it is unique , and the film is well acted and directed ( by William Wellman ) . Perhaps not a Capra movie , but it is a nice one all the same .

Text2: Herb Freed ( Graduation Day ; Beyond Evil ) directs this psychological melodrama ( . . with elements of a slasher ) regarding the effects on a small town , and especially troubled Ingrid ( May Britt ) , as a sexual predator stalks vulnerable women at night with a pair of scissors after raping them . Ingrid is haunted by memories from childhood regarding finding her mother dead in a bathtub and possible sexual abuse at the hands of "" reliable "" Uncle Carl ( Cameron Mitchell , whose role is minor until the enigmatic ending where he supposedly returns to Ingrid's home where memories of his own resurface after being away for a while ) . It seems that Ingrid is being stalked by the town stud , Frankie ( William Gray Espy ) , who even rapes her in her own bedroom , holding scissors to her throat . Ingrid is a deeply devout Catholic who is suffering hallucinations thanks to her past ( . . blood is a constant ) and seems incredibly uncomfortable around men . Husky voiced , alcoholic sheriff ( Aldo Ray ) is truly puzzled about the attacks plaguing his once quiet , sleepy little town , and is quite concerned for his citizens , innocent women who might venture out at night alone . Trying to sober up , the sheriff will attempt to find the killer , keeping his deputies on alert , watching the country roads and neighborhood streets at night , hoping to catch him in the act . Meanwhile , Ingrid battles with her conscience and religious convictions after being raped . The film also subtly hints at the idea that her mysterious Uncle Carl might be the one responsible for the attacks . Also , a mannerly , soft-spoken stranger from Baltimore , Bill Spry ( Robert Hippard ) enters town hoping to date Ingrid , who seems little interested in making relations with any man . Director Freed and collaborative writer Anne Marisse craft a very tricky tale here which takes it's time building the attacks around Ingrid's story . The attacks themselves really are the Macguffen as the film centers around Ingrid , and serve to actually heighten her trauma . Through the surrounding attacks in town , Ingrid , slightly stable on a slender thread , goes off the deep end with the scissor-murders influencing her hostile fantasies . The film seems to have three endings . The police cornering the sexual sadist in a saw mill . Ingrid's confrontation with Frankie as a bound Carl tries to free himself . And , Ingrid's fate and the reactions from the sheriff and Carl relating the truth to the viewer . Freed doesn't hurry himself and the film takes it's time developing so it might can become tedious for some viewers ( . . such as choir practice and a bar conversation between Spry and a local gal-pal of Ingrid's who is a potential victim ) . I think one might also find the last thirty minutes tiresome due to the complexities of Ingrid and what is real and imagined . I found it worthwhile and thought Britt's performance was a stunner . The score from Pino Donaggio really adds quality to the tragedy ever so present throughout the film . Freed does an exceptional job incorporating Ingrid's memories within her life at the present , with Donaggio's somber music adding the right touch at reflecting her deteriorating mental state .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: Who Can Kill a Child starts off with a drawn out sequence depicting real life horror against children . There's quite a difference between real life and cinematic horror , and had Chicho Ibáñez-Serrador's film been cheap and nasty along the same lines as a great number of other European horror films , it would have been safe to say that the movie is in bad taste . However , not only is the introduction sequence needed ; Ibáñez-Serrador makes a point out of it that he harks back at to at several points during the movie . It has to be said that the point of the film is a little muddled and doesn't always come across ; but then again , this film could have been without point and the atmosphere and core idea alone would have ensured the film its status as a cult classic . The plot follows a holidaying couple who decide to take a boat from mainland Spain to a small island just off the coast . They soon realise that something is wrong as , other than the kids that greeted them ; the island is eerily deserted , and things worsen when it transpires that the kids are the cause of the lack of adults . . . The major standout of this film is the style . Director Chicho Ibáñez-Serrador creates a creepy atmosphere by way of the deserted streets within the clean , white location in which the film takes place . The tension then builds , and the happiness of the couple turns into despair as their situations worsens with each minute of running time . Lewis Fiander and Prunella Ransome take the lead roles , and deliver performances that are concurrent with the film . Fiander reminded me a lot of Donald Sutherland in Don't Look Now , as he continually loses control over his situation . In contrast , Ransome gives it her all as his opposite number , and the pair share a believable chemistry on screen . The director's use of the camera is superb . Ibáñez-Serrador continually develops a strong foreboding atmosphere and in doing so creates a series of memorable sequences ; the one that sees the camera caress a corpse hidden behind a store shelf towards the beginning being a particular highlight . The fact that the villains of the film are innocent looking children ensures that the film is always going to be shocking ; but the director handles the plot well , as Who Can Kill a Child never descends into comic book horror , and the use of blood is suitably restrained . Overall ; this is a movie you don't see very often - an original and truly harrowing horror picture and one that shouldn't be missed by Eurohorror fans !","{""output"": ""NO""}"
470,"Text1: Says my TV guide , "" In World War II Holland , a woman of the Jewish resistance falls in love with the German officer she was sent to seduce . "" That makes it sound like another sappy love story . We visualize the scene in which the luscious babe holds a trembling pistol against the head of her sleeping Nazi lover , her face a mask of anguish . "" Do I love him too much to kill him "" ? Actually , it's much more than that , a bitter and adult story of intrigue and betrayal among the Dutch resistance during the German occupation . Paul Verhoeven directed not only this highly European film but a number of American action movies as well , and he learned his commercial lessons in Hollywood , but he hasn't imported them to his native Holland . This isn't "" Robocop "" or a Schwarzenegger Schlagfest by any means . Lots of nudity , yes , but mostly non-erotic - - and male as well as female . Sharon Stone may open her knees and cross her legs while half a dozen men goggle and lick their lips . Here , Clarice Van Houten bleaches her pubic hair on screen and nothing is made of it except that she is Jewish , has black hair , and is trying to make herself blond all over so as not to be found out . What horror . And it doesn't follow the usual trajectory , with a climactic shoot out at the end . Most of the good guys die before the end , except the ones who most deserve it . The German officer with whom Clarice falls in love ( Jobst Schnibbe ) is a fundamentally decent guy who , seeing the war's end , tries to prevent more bloodshed by arranging a truce with the Resistance . These kinds of stories generally call for him to die a heroic , self-sacrificing death , maybe in order to save the girl's life . But it doesn't happen . He dies alright , but only because he's caught , mistaken for a Nazi , and the Canadians who liberate the city permit a cooperative but still fascistic German to carry out the death sentence that has been imposed on Schnibbe . It's not a heroic death . Schnibbe is simply stood up against a stone wall and shot . If there's a problem with the film , it may be that Verhoeven has learned a little too much from Hollywood . The end of the war , and the liberation of Amsterdam by the British and Canadians , is followed by a lengthy story of mistaken intentions and Allied gloating that lead not just to Schnibbe's death but to the incarceration and humiliation of Clarice by a drunken Dutch rabble . I mean - - they dump a cauldron of human excrement on her , and the scene is drawn out until long after we've grasped the point . And there's a great deal of gun play . It seems to go on and on , while automatic weapons tear bodies apart . But this is no more a dumb action movie than it is a simple-minded love story . If it has its commercial elements , it at least is ambitious enough to reach for an audience of grown-ups who can understand the complexity of motives and of human nature . Every once in a while , during a pause in the narrative , I thought of Anne Frank and her family and friends , most of whom lived in Holland and died before the end of the war - - and of Audrey Hepburn too , who managed to live through it .

Columbo also as a side-kick in this movie the yuppie and by-the-book Sgt . Frederic Wilson , Bob Dishy . Sgt . Wilson in fact gives Columbo a taste of his own medicine with him acting like a nagging and obnoxious nudnick . Sgt . Wilson gets so under his partner and boss , Lt . Columbo , skin that he at one point in the movie Columbo seems to have just got up and left in disgust leaving Sgt . Wilson to do all the work in solving the murder case all by himself . Planing a fake kidnapping and ransom world famous botanist Jarvis Goodland , Ray Milland , has his good for nothing nephew Tony , Bradford Dillman , pretend that he's in danger of getting murdered by his kidnappers . Tony's wife Cathy , Sandra Smith , is told that if she doesn't come up with the $300 , 000 . 00 that his supposed kidnapper demands he'll end up dead . In fact both Jarvis & Tony staged this whole extravaganza and plan to split the money and leave Cathy , who's anything but a loving and caring wife , out in the cold and $300 , 000 . 00 lighter . With Jarvis getting the cash from Tony himself , disguised with a nylon sock over his head , both Lt . Columbo and Sgt . Wilson watch from a distance . Jarvis instead of going back to the two hidden policemen instead makes off to Jarvis ' secret hideout in the country where Tony is . As Tony is about to take off with his share of he loot he's shot and killed by his ungrateful uncle , and partner in crime , Jarvis Goodland . Lt . Columbo is certain that the kidnapping was staged and that one of the persons involved double-crossed the other , tony , to get the cash . Still Columbo has no evidence to prove it and that's where his partner Sgt . Wilson comes in . With his modern police methods Sgt . Wilson comes up with the missing puzzle that in the end would implicate the killer , Jarvis , in Tony's murder . Jarvis in the meantime is tying to frame Tony's widow in the murder of her husband by planting the murder weapon , a . 32 pistol , in her bedroom dresser . Jarvis , a real elitist jerk , who's just dripping with contempt at the annoying Lt . Columbo every time he has to talk to him feels that he got away with not only the perfect murder but with the $300 , 000 . 00 in ransom money . It comes as a big surprise when Jarvis finds Lt . Columbo in his greenhouse at 3 : 00AM in the morning with the evidence . The evidence that in the end would put Jarvis on ice and behind bars for the rest of his life . The gun that Jarvis used to murder Tony , as well as stage his kidnapping , was used a year earlier in Jarvis shooting at an intruder who broke into his greenhouse ! That bullet that Columbo found buried in the dirt of the greenhouse match the two bullets and gun that was used in Tony's kidnapping and murder . The murder weapon belonged to not Cathy , whom Jarvis was trying to frame , but to Jarvis himself ! There's also in the movie the handsome hunky and powerfully built William Smith playing the thankless and almost invisible role of Nick Cathy Goodland's secret and illicit lover . Smith would later in his career become somewhat of a cult movie legend in movies like "" The Invasion of the Bee Girls "" and "" The Ultimate Warrior "" . There's also that very underrated and timely end of the world movie that Smith stared in , the unforgettable to anyone who ever saw the movie "" Twilight's Last Gleaming "" .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The only real characterization that's developed is Mabel's who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except , of course , when she's frightened . It's easy to see why she became a star . It's largely because of her that I'd recommended seeing this at least once and why I'm giving this a 4 .

474,"Text1: What a big step-down QoS is . If you are expecting the Godfather Part II or a film equal to The Dark Knight you are in for a huge disappointment . Despite being the highest budgeted Bond film ever ( just where all the money went is beyond me ) , QoS is half-hearted and extremely simple . Of all the Bond films in history I've never seen one as straight-forward as this . As a direct sequel to Casino Royale the film drops pretty much ALL plot and focuses on action . What little story there is , almost the same story from A View to a Kill ( which was actually a carbon copy of Goldfinger ) , is nothing more than a weak excuse to string together a bunch of action scenes that feel more like alternate Jason Bourne fights rather than a Bond film . There's no mystery , no puzzle-solving and nothing resembling dangerous espionage . The 105-minute running time cripples QoS . Don't get me wrong , I hate films that are padded with dead weight , but QoS just feels too light and too hurried . Daniel Craig handles the action well , but is thoroughly un-engaging when it comes to the emotional scenes . I don't like his interpretation of Bond and I am sick to death of all these ' tragic action heroes ' that are so damn common these days . I'm also sick of guns as an extension of manhood , which QoS has a lot of . The British press made a big hoo-hah over Gemma Arterton being cast as a Bond Girl ( a term that I really don't like ) , but I swear she's in it for about five minutes and has about ten lines of dialogue before she meets a strange end in an obscure Goldfinger reference . On the plus side , David Arnold delivers his best Bond score to date , it's just a shame it didn't have a better movie to provide the images to his sounds . Bond should call it a day . He's been in the movies for close to 50 years and , in my opinion , he's had too many restarts , too many women and too many missions . Bond is a dinosaur and completely out of place in the modern world . Despite attempts at making him relevant and contemporary , I feel that his time is up and that he should step aside for a new hero . Just not a ' tragic ' one .

Text2: I missed out on this film during its cinema release as I figured it to be yet another sex-comedy with gross-out gags . While the film does contain a little of this it is way more character based and the humor comes from more absurd situations than disgusting . Never judge book by its cover eh . Andy Stitzer ( Steve Carrell ) is a 40-year-old virgin . His life is made up of working in the returns department of an electronics store , collecting toys of movie characters and watching reality TV with his OAP neighbors . The touch of a woman is foreign to him and he is yet to educated in their mysterious ways . Though he does have the bonus of not having to put up with their moaning , tantrums and bitching ' because they can ' ! When his secret is wrenched out of him his work buddies make it their mission to help him pop his cherry and think of a zillion , wacky , hair-brained schemes . But Andy is interested in Trish ( Catherine Keener ) the woman from the store across the road . Only he's really intimidated and arranges a weird no-sex policy with her that originally makes her relax at not having to live up to expectations but eventually makes her want to explode . Can he keep his secret from her too and perform the dirty deed with apparent expertise of your average porn stud ? I'm so cynical of all these ' extended cuts ' that are appearing on DVD at the moment . Most are completely unnecessary and give us only a couple more minutes of pointlessness , but The 40 Year Old Virgin gives us a staggering 17 extra minutes and bulks up the films running time to an incredible 133 minutes . For such a thin premise , the film gets an impressive amount of mileage and you never really feels like it's dragging along . With decent characters and story that just breezes along , without being superficial , the best long movies seem like very short ones . 40YOV is definitely one of those . And I promise you this is not a ' rom-com ' or a ' sex-com ' . Despite some crude humor here and there this is more of a light-hearted ' drama-com ' . Carrell also proves he a far more talented actor and comedian than Will Ferrel or Adam ' Pissbag ' Sandler . Three stars are for the movie but it gets an extra bonus half-star for including a wonderfully , wonderfully top-heavy actress as Trish's daughter .

475,"Text1: The TV guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES as thus : "" An experiment on a severed arm goes awry "" so right away I thought this was going to be about an arm that's got a mind of its own as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or THE HAND or someone getting an arm transplant as in BODY PARTS . Both premises are tried and tested , or to be more accurate tired and tested so I was curious as to how the producers would approach the story . I actually thought they were making an arthouse movie like PI down to the use of B & W photography at the start of the film but the makers seemed to have tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splatter comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD . I've very little to say on this except that I disliked THE EVIL DEAD movies and I disliked SEVERED TIES and it seems really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world is crying out for condoms

Text2: IT'LL BE ALRIGHT ON THE NIGHT was heavily hyped in the weeks leading up to its broadcast by ITV in 1977 . This was common in Britain at the time because we only had three channels in those days : BBC 1 , BBC 2 and ITV and no one ever watched BBC 2 so ITV and BBC 1 were at war in order to get ratings The show itself is a collection of out takes from movies and TV shows presented by the painfully unfunny Denis Norden , the type of character who thinks he's funny when in fact he's not . Example ? "" With a title like It'll be alright on the night you may think this has something to do with a wedding . . . "" I can't think how he described a cock - up . But anyway the clips themselves were outrageous since some of them contained nudity like a singer / dancer struggling in vain to stop her swimsuit from slipping down to reveal her breasts , and the clip from an American news report that has a man cheekily stripping off in the background and waving ( Behave yourself ) with his hand towards the camera . This risque show was the main topic of conversation at school on the Monday morning due to the nudity , but being an innocent soul my favourite clip was the broadcaster announcing a trailer for 70s female prison drama WITHIN THESE WALLS which cut to a bunch of puppets singing and dancing which had me laughing out loud . Unfortunately ITV decided to kill the golden goose by making more editions of IT'LL BE ALRIGHT ON THE NIGHT every couple of years where the supply of genuinely funny clips soon became exausted . Worse than that by the mid 1990s both ITV and BBC schedules started producing a ridiculous amount of out take shows like TV NIGHTMARES , LAUGHTER FILE and AUNTIES BLOOMERS where a very small percentage of clips are either funny or original and has you wishing the first IT'LL BE ALRIGHT ON THE NIGHT had stayed as a one off","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: War movies are very different . Usually , these differences depend on the film-makers ' experience with war or knowledge of it . Occasionally , the time it was made and society's view towards it has its say in the matter too . This film was made by Oliver Stone , so naturally it's based on his experiences in the Vietnam war . Personally , I don't think there is a better war movie than All Quiet on the Western Front from 1979 , simply because it's beautiful , concise and effective without simply showing lots of stuff blowing up or killing off characters we can relate to . Despite that , this film is still worth watching , simply due to how well-directed and intense it is . The plot is quite good , and follows a single platoon through a period in ' 67 , during the Vietnam war . The pacing is good , though I felt that the film started somewhat slow only to later kick up to a very fast pace for a while . There didn't seem to be enough character development . I never picked up on all the names . Maybe there are too many major characters . That's something I often find in Stone's films , making them quite hard to sit through , and requiring more than one viewing to take it all in ( which shouldn't be necessary . . . he's not Kubrick , after all ) . The acting is great . The casting is great , not one character seems miscast . The special effects are great . The characters are credible , interesting and well-written . The direction and editing is talented and effective . The film has a few memorable scenes , and the dialog contains a good bit of quotable lines . Not much else to say about the film . . . it's quite graphic and very direct , so you should only watch it if you're completely certain that you can take it . Oh , and John C .

I mean he's a great comedic actor , but him as the Grinch ? It just didn't make any sense to me . His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments . Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable . The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed . They actually just destroyed the story , period . All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly .

But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas . How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top .

The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done , not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas ! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry .

478,"Text1: Julian Schnabel , well accepted as one of the important visual artists of our time , continues to impress with his small but elite group of films , proving that paintings and cinema are closely related as a means to reach the psyche . In ' Le Scaphandre et le papillon ' ( ' The Diving Bell and the Butterfly ' ) he has transformed the memoir of Jean-Dominique Bauby ( with the sensitive screen adaptation by Ronald Harwood ) into an experience for the mind and the heart . It is an extraordinary blend of visual effects , poetry , exquisite acting , and the perseverance of the human mind to communicate with the world when all seeming variations of communication are stripped away . Jean-Dominique ( Jean-Do ) Bauby ( Mathieu Amalric ) was the editor of the French magazine ' Elle ' , living with the beautiful Céline Desmoulins ( Emmanuelle Seigner ) and their three children , when during a ride with his son he has a massive stroke that leaves him completely paralyzed ( the ' locked-in syndrome ' ) . When he awakens from his coma he is able to hear and to see but he cannot speak or move , except for his eyes . From this point we , the audience , experience the world as through the eyes of Jean-Do , share his frustrations of being unable to speak , and in his ultimately having to communicate through the fine skills of his speech therapist Henriette Durand ( Marie-Josée Croze ) by blinking his eye once or twice for yes or no as each letter of the alphabet is spoken - an arduous task for both patient and visitor . He decides he wants to write his memoirs and Claude ( Anne Consigny ) is assigned to take his ' dictation ' . The only faculties Jean-Do retains are his memory and his fantasies , and it is through the acting out of these that we discover the victim's private and secret life as well as his relationships to colleagues and lovers and family . He imagines the hospital where he is confined in the time of Nijinsky ( Nicolas Le Riche ) and Empress Eugénie ( Emma de Caunes ) and filters the realities of his life through the interactions with his comrades Laurent ( Isaach De Bankolé ) and others as well as vivid memories of his relationship with his father Papinou Bauby ( Max von Sydow ) . With the patient assistance of the health providers , friends and family he is able to complete his memoir , the story of a man locked in a diving bell longing for the freedom of a butterfly , released form its cocoon . . Getting used to the film technique Schnabel uses takes patience , but for those who are willing to accept the pace of the film , rich with fantasy and historical sequences , the impact is not only compelling but breathtaking . This telling of a true story is a fine work from all concerned and for this viewer it is one of the best films of recent years . Grady Harp

Text2: FAR NORTH is a bleak , disturbing story about isolation , relationships and revenge . Director Asif Kapadia adapted this minimal dialogue screenplay with Tim Miller based on the story ' True North ' by Sara Maitland , and even with the strong trio of actors , have managed to maintain the main character as the vast , natural , incomprehensibly difficult ice seas of the northern cap of the globe . The film is as majestically beautiful as the story is terrifying . Saiva ( Michelle Yeoh ) was pronounced evil by a shaman who witnessed her birth : any person who comes near her will fall to harm . Cast out from her tribe , Saiva has survived into adulthood accompanied by the young girl Anja ( Michelle Krusiec ) she has raised , living a simple existence in tents , dependent on any available food , and always in hiding from a strange pursuing army of soldiers : flashbacks show how Saiva had been physically abused by this strange band of wandering men . When danger approaches , the two women simply move on . Saiva finds an injured and starving soldier Yoki ( Sean Bean ) who is likewise escaping from the marauding band , and brings him into her tent , nursing him to health , exchanging signs of friendship to a stranger that seems so natural yet so foreign to guarded Saiva . As Yoki recovers , Anja's curiosity about love and men is heightened and soon Anja and Yoki are planning to strike out on their own . When Saiva witnesses the passion between the two people in her life , she reacts as a threatened animal and the horrors that follow echo across the frozen ice of her isolated life . Michelle Yeoh is astonishingly fine in this difficult role and Krusiec and Bean provide solid ensemble support . Praise must go to Asif Kapadia for his tense direction of this thriller , but kudos are also in order for the extraordinary cinematography by Roman Osin and the appropriately eerie musical score by Dario Marianelli . Much of what happens in this film is shocking to the viewer's senses , but it so in keeping with the animal responses in nature that it says much about our concept of ' civilization ' . FAR NORTH is a remarkable achievement . Highly recommended . Grady Harp","{""output"": ""YES""}"

What makes this film even better was on the constant off-screen bickering between Streisand and Walter Matthau , who portrays the curmudgeon Horace Vandergelder . Matthau is Vandergelder in every way . Thanks to the crisp dialogue in the film , he delivers his line faithfully . He is a sourpuss in every way of his life and he never lets the audience forget that with his sharp biting responses . Had Streisand been older , she would have been even more ideal for the part .

Text2: Billy Wilder's memorable dramatic film , "" Sunset Boulevard , "" was made in 1950 . The lead role of Norma Desmond , a washed-up actress , had first been offered to actresses Pola Negri and Norma Shearer before landing in the capable hands of Gloria Swanson . This film heralded the return to the screen by Miss Swanson after many years . It was well worth the wait . Swanson , as Desmond , evokes fear and emotion-complex but yet believable to the audience . A has been actress , who dreams of a comeback , she is mystified by the appearance of William Holden , an apparent gigolo , who made a wrong turn with his car and entered the Desmond world . Norma is needy and emotionally ill . Her butler , played by the excellent Erich Von Stroheim , admits to Holden , that he had been married to Desmond years before . Though the marriage had faltered , he remained to tend to her needs . He even sends her cards with the names of her adoring public-in reality long since gone .

Bonnie Franklin played red head divorcée and mother of two teenage daughters who moves from Loganport , Indiana to the big city of Indianapolis .

Nan Fabray who played Ann's mother . I loved Richard Masur as Ann's first boyfriend after her divorce . I thought he should have stayed on but it wouldn't work if Ann remarried so soon after the divorce papers were inked . I remember Shelley Fabares on the show as one of her co-workers as well as Mary Louise Wilson as a cocktail waitress neighbor . It was one of the few shows that I could recall was set in Indianapolis . I thought the show was well-written most of the time and the acting was worthy of the Emmys it received . They don't make shows like this . I remember the apartment layout most of all . Despite Phillips ' substance problems , Valerie was truly a star in the making .

Text2: A sharply turned romantic comedy as Peter Coke attempts to sabotage an old-fashioned brewery and woo Nova Pilbeam at the same time . Part of the charm of this movie for me is that I see here one of the forebears of the Ealing comedies of the 1950s - - Ronald Neame worked on this , as well as S . C . Balcon , one of the producers of the prototype of the Ealing community of eccentrics , WENT THE DAY WELL ? But is an actually an Ealing comedy ? Well , yes , it's from Ealing , and it's a comedy . But there is more to being an Ealing Comedy than being a comedy and being from Ealing Studios . Will Hays last few movies were not Ealing comedies , even if they were produced by Ealing . So what makes an Ealing Comedy ? Many things , but I will focus on one or two points . In many ways , the Ealing comedies were intensely nostalgic for an England that existed only in the artists ' minds , from the boys'-series-mad gangs of HUE AND CRY to the sentimental murderers of THE LADY KILLERS to Guinness ' betrayed but still still unbowed scientist of THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT . The eccentrics find their support in the other eccentrics , here in the workers of the brewery , who include Will Hays ' supporting comics . Undoubtedly I am reading too much into this : blame , if you will , a taste for academic analysis . But this is a fine romantic comedy and if you have a chance to see it , don't miss it .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Christopher Lambert's first line in this film ( ' Let her go . ' ) is delivered in this way , and it's actually pretty effective . He sounds intimidating , and he even makes you glad that you are not one of the people that he is talking to . Unfortunately , he never stops talking like this , and it makes the rest of the movie ridiculous . This is exactly the same way that Wesley Snipes ruined Blade . Besides the awful special effects and the groan inducing performances delivered by everyone involved , Beowulf even sinks to the level of semi erotica , with several misplaced ' almost'-nude scenes that just should not have been in this movie . This is just your basic good vs . evil mediocre adventure film that leaves a bad taste . Very disappointing .

ROOM OF BLOOD SCENE : My original version : Jimmy walks in to see the head nurse dead and he slips in a pool of her blood and hits his head hard . Later he walks in the car where Laurie is hiding but he suddenly dies . Read more about this in the alternate ending . My edited version : Jimmy never went in the room but the same exact scene was used when Michael Myers got blown up as it showed Jimmy getting caught by the explosion and hits his head . HEAD STAFF SCENE : My original version : the head nurse and the doctor are shown dead . My edited version : the head nurse and the doctor are never shown dead and is never told as you wonder what happened to them . ALTERNATE ENDING : My edited version : When Laurie gets into the ambulance a figure covered up with a sheet is on the other bed and the figure is jimmy and Laurie cries and say "" we made it "" several times and he smiles at her .

Text2: I saw this silent British comedy at Cinefest 2006 in Liverpool , New York . There was some murmuring in the ( mostly American ) audience when somebody spotted the name of this movie's production company in the credits : Swastika Films . Don't worry , folks . In 1919 , Germany's National Socialist movement hadn't got started yet , and the swastika had not yet been co-opted by Nazis . In fact , the British government had set up a national health-insurance and savings scheme , and they needed a simple and distinctive image to put on the depositors ' passbooks . . . so they chose the swastika . During this same period , Rudyard Kipling's publisher was issuing Kipling's novels with a suavastika ( an anti-clockwise swastika ) on the covers . For audiences in British cinemas in 1919 , the swastika had only favourable associations . ' Bamboozled ' stars Fred Rains as an Alley Sloper-ish character who takes his girlfriend Gladys to the park in hopes of a quick snog , but they can never get a bench alone together . A young spiv named Priceless Percy offers a solution involving a mechanical woman . What happens is completely implausible but reasonably funny . Fred Rains was a long-time stage actor who bore a marked resemblance to his son , none other than Claude Rains . At the time when ' Bamboozled ' was made , Claude Rains had already begun a stage career of his own , but would soon settle down as a dramatics teacher ( John Gielgud being one of his students ) before trying his luck in Hollywood . The slapstick acting demonstrated by Fred Rains here in ' Bamboozled ' is a far cry from his son Claude's subtle demeanour , but Claude had the benefit of sound films to display his magnificent voice . I'll rate ' Bamboozled ' , mostly for its historic value .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: This is a bad movie that purports to be an educational film designed to warn America about the menace of teenagers running amok thanks to uninvolved parents . However , like almost all the so-called "" educational "" films of the 30s and 40s , it was really a shabby little film designed to be snuck past the censors of the Hays Office . In 1934 , the major studios all agreed to abide by the dictates of a stronger Production Code - - eliminating sex , nudity , cursing and "" inappropriate "" plots in films ( these had actually been relatively common in films in the early 30s ) . However , in an effort to sneak in smut , small studios created films to shock adults when they learn about terrible social ills , though they were REALLY intended to titillate and slip adult themes past the censors ! Such films as MARIJUANA , MAD YOUTH , REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS were all schlocky trash that skirted past the boards because they were supposedly educational . Even though they were laughably bad , they also made money due to low production costs and because they often offered nudity , violence and sordid story lines - - all in the name of education ! Unlike many of these films , DELINQUENT DAUGHTERS didn't have nudity , but it sure had lots of sleazy story elements that were sure to titillate . In this film , teens drank , used drugs , committed pointless robberies and assaults and drove like maniacs - - all apparently the result of poor parental guidance . And as a result , kids died in this movie - - and in the most spectacular ways ! The acting and writing were almost universally bad , though the sequence where the judge tells off the parents of these punks actually was amazingly good - - too bad everything else was pretty lousy . In fact , one character was so bad , so annoying and so gosh-darn awful , I nominate the ditsy blonde as the most annoying character of the 1940s - - she was THAT bad ! ! Her voice was more grating than Olive Oyl's and she was practically sub-human in her stupidity !","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The only problem is that Quid can't convince anyone else that this could be the case . Pretty soon Quid finds his own life in considerable jeopardy . Early 80's horror scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis pops up as a brassy runaway rich heiress who's along for the ride . Cunningly combining elements of "" Duel , "" vintage Alfred Hitchcock pictures ( chiefly "" Rear Window "" ) , 70's existential road movies and early 80's slasher fare , this spiffy , absorbing and suspenseful mystery thriller works like gangbusters . Richard Franklin ( who next did the surprisingly acceptable "" Psycho II "" and later faltered with the abysmal killer monkey dud "" Link "" ) directs with tremendous skill and assurance while both Brian ( "" The Road Warrior "" ) May's flavorful , harmonica-tinged score and Vincent ( "" Thirst "" ) Morton's exquisitely expansive cinematography are definitely up to speed . Moreover , the dingy desert locations evoke a frightfully palpable feeling of all-encompassing dread , isolation and vulnerability , the tension steadily escalates to a nerve-wracking fever pitch , there are amusing touches of offbeat humor featured throughout and the final confrontation between Quid and the killer in a cramped back alley delivers one hell of a potent gut punch . The nifty tweaking of your standard average guy in danger scenario in particular is a nice inspired touch ; this scenario is given a fresh and engaging workover by making Quid a likeably quirky oddball . An eerie , understated and above all intelligent stand-out scary sleeper .

Text2: 1968 , New Mexico . Marjoe Gortner gives an incredibly intense , commanding and charismatic performance as Teddy , a bitter , crazed , disgruntled Vietnam veteran hippie drug dealer psycho who along with his loyal , but scared girlfriend Cheryl ( nicely played by the adorable Candy Clark ) terrorizes a motley assortment of people in a remote roadside diner at gunpoint . Teddy forces the folks to own up to ugly truths about Vietnam , America , and , most of all , themselves . Director Milton Katselas , working from a biting and incisive script by Mark Medoff , cranks up the seething tension to an almost unbearably nerve-wracking fever pitch and milks the protracted diner confrontation sequence for all its worth . The bang-up acting from a tip-top cast qualifies as a substantial sterling asset : Hal Linden as pathetic weakling Richard Ethridge , Lee Grant as Richard's fiery , fed-up wife Clarisse , Peter Firth as surly greaser short order cook Stephen Ryder , Stephanie Faracy as sweet , dumpy waitress Angel Childress , Pat Hingle as amiable , crippled diner owner Lyle Striker , Audra Lindley as Stephen's sad burn-out mother Ceil , Bill McKinney as macho local hot shot Tommy Clark , and Anne Ramsay as Angel's shrewish mom Rhea . However , this picture still rates as Marjoe's show all the way : Whether he's suffering a painful and humiliating rectal search from a border official or trying to get Stephen to act on his swaggering false bravado , Gortner's electrifying portrayal of a cruel and dangerous sociopath remains strong and riveting from start to finish . Jules Brenner's sharp , agile cinematography , Jack Nitzsche's rattling , throbbing score , and an excellent soundtrack of mournful country ballads and groovy 60's rock songs are all likewise smack dab on the money .

487,"Text1: Watching this is kind of like watching a drawing by Picasso from his childhood . . . or a home video shot by Stanley Kubrick . Arguably the greatest Danish series of the comedy genre , the films about The Olsen Gang have entertained countless people in many countries . . . as my father informed me , the former Eastern Germany found it delightful , as it mocked authority ( it was permitted by the censors , due to Denmark being a ( primarily ) capitalistic system ) . Actually , when they translated the films ( by dubbing , as Germany and France are two of the only countries to possess too much arrogance and pride over their language to learn any other , including English ) , they had to cut out the character of Yvonne . . . as they simply could not find a German actress to match her . That says something about the energetic and hilarious performance she brings to each of the films ( apart from the very last . . . as she had unfortunately passed away , which was one of the main reasons that it was delayed so many years . . . and was pitifully awful of a movie by most standards ) . The actors , basic plot progression , even the theme was in place , right here , from the beginning . . . it just wasn't as refined as it got to be , through the series . Much of it is just dreadful ; the humor is silly and mostly stays at the level of the common denominator ( though there are some traces of the satire and social commentary of the later films , as well as the human touch , the small details apparent in most of the films ) . The acting is incredibly overdone in most cases . . . even in that of Poul Reichchardt , a seasoned veteran within the art of acting , renowned not only for his film work , but for his many plays in The Danish Royal Theater . The plot is all over the place . . . for an 80-minute film ( most of the later films reach over 100 minutes ) , it's got more mix-ups and complications than most films of three or four hours . In spite of its almost insipid , uninspired simplicity , it's almost difficult to follow , and far harder to recall . The pace is almost constantly , insistingly off . . . as if the film doesn't know when to move , where it's going . . . or how to get there . Some scenes consist entirely of jokes , and many of these are of a comic , cartoony nature . . . the "" gang "" survive a major blast from explosives , to give a brief example . Anyone who's seen the film will most likely grant that the last few scenes of the film are just about impossible to take seriously . Then there are all the quips ( though , admittedly , some are somewhat funny ) at porno , and the diverse reactions towards it ( at the time , just before it was released , the issue of it was heavily debated ) . . . all in all , this film is just very much a sign of its time . It was made to appeal to the masses , and this is what Danes preferred back then . . . silly , mindless fun . It wasn't until a few films later that this series really started to become sophisticated . But that doesn't mean that this film should be forgotten ; apart from of course an excellent window into the world view of the Denmark of the late 60's , this film should be watched simply to see the roots of this grand series . Most of what people remember of all the good films of the franchise starts here . . . it may not be as refined or well-executed as it got to be , but it's still there . The walk of the gang , Yvonne's rants , Egon's impassioned speech to Benny and Kjeld , the very first heist of the film which is always destined to go wrong ( one might add that the visual of the three , as we first see them , might have been better saved for a later film , or at least a later moment in this one , as it would have a more humorous effect , once the audience were used to the sight of the three as they usually look ) . . . it started here . It has been said that the most important step of the journey is the first . . . and while this is arguably ( among ) the least memorable or entertaining of the steps that is the journey of this series , it is still that vitally important first one . Without this , the world would never have known The Olsen Gang . For that alone , it has my respect . Starting with the next movie , there are changes made . The series heads towards grandeur . . . slowly , perhaps , but it makes it . I recommend this film to any fan of Danish cinema and The Olsen Gang . If you don't know any of the other films of the series ( this wasn't the first I saw ; this wasn't where my interest in the franchise begun ) , I suggest you either look for the good , funny things in this ( since they all reappear , many of them done far better , in the later films ) or give one of the later films ( starting around number 5 , "" Runs Amok "" ) a chance before or after watching this . There is somewhat little in the way of overall plot throughout the series ( though I advise making sure you see at least one other film before "" Runs Amok "" , and make sure you don't start with one of the ( 2 ? I think ) "" Gang "" films that start at their holiday destination ( any real fan of these films will be able to answer that off the top of their head , and anyone who isn't should find out from the films and not this review ) .

Text2: After finally seeing Gremlins , after hearing so much about how much better it is than the second ( which I've seen two or three times , as my favorite Danish TV network seems to be crazy about it ) , I can't help but think : That's it ? That's what I've been hearing so much positive stuff about ? The only horror lies in the horrible out-dated effects , and the humor , or lack thereof , is typical for 80's comedies . Really , what does this film have to offer that any other film doesn't ? It's got all of the typical monster-film clichés just to show exactly how uncreative and unoriginal the writer and director is . The main cliché being ; no one believing that there is such a creature , until they see it with their own eyes . . . and even then , they're doubting the hero . The jokes are tired and dull , and repeated into endlessness . . . the father-character's inventions not working , the Gremlins acting senselessly , noisy and destructively ( strangely reminiscent of bratty children or the typical guy who's a jock and / or drunk ) . . . not to mention them acting like humans ( "" look , it thinks it's people ! "" ) . What's funny about dressed up obviously fake puppets smashing things , anyway ? I can't imagine why this would be funny to anyone but the kids . The really small kids . The infants . The plot is lame . The pacing is off ( I was bored throughout most of the film and was half-asleep when it was done ) and uneven . The characters are mostly poorly written clichés not to mention terribly unimaginative . . . the old lady who's basically a Mrs . Scrooge , the old wise Asian guy ( Japanese , Chinese , whatever . . . he's got those Asian eyes and he's old , so he must be very intelligent , reserved , and spouting nonsensical fortune cookie slogans ) , the old guy who complains a lot . . . come on , I mean . . . did Joe Dante and Chris Columbus just want the paycheck really , really bad , and didn't feel like bothering with giving us viewers a decent product ? The acting is nothing special . The special effects are instantly see-through and awfully outdated . The humor is dull and repetitive . Well , I suppose if you like seeing stuff blow up ( which the father-character's inventions always do , eventually ) and poorly designed puppets destroying pricey items , you might like it . Otherwise , I don't really recommend this to anyone . . . unless they're die-hard fans of 80's films . One last thing ; what the heck was up with the supposedly depressing black comedy-like story Phoebe Cates ' character gives towards the ending of the film , to explain her not celebrating Christmas ? I mean , I understand her and all , but was that really necessary ? It felt very out of place . I don't mind a depressing story about Christmas , not at all , but it just seems like they were originally making a much darker film , and then decided to redo some scenes , but forgot that one . OK , one last thing ( I promise ) : why am I not surprised that the US is one of the few countries to give this film a rating that says that children can watch it ? It's got plenty of violence and disgusting imagery , so I can't see why . . . oh , that's right . . . there's no sex in it . Silly me . Because , as we all know , sex is the very worst thing in the world and children may not , under any circumstances , be subjected to it ( or even a hint of it ) on screen . Please . The MPAA are ridiculous in their ratings . This is a childish film , no doubt about that , but hardly a children's film . I recommend it to fans of 80's films and not really anyone else , as I doubt anyone else will enjoy it . My rating is only above 5 to acknowledge the effort put into it .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

"" That gives you a pretty good indication of the target audience - - snoops and gossips . Actually , the movie is rather better than that , but not that much better . Sam Masterson ( Van Heflin ) returns to his home town of Iverstown after an absence of 17 or 18 years to find that his teen-aged girl friend , Martha Ivers ( Barbara Stanwyk ) has married the nerdish Walter O'Neil . Martha is now the powerful owner of the local factory . ( It's an indication of the care that has gone into the writing that we never have any idea of what the factory makes . ) Walter ( Kirk Douglas ) is still an alcoholic weakling and Stanwyk orders him around like a flunky . As kids , the three of them were involved in the accidental death of Martha's mean old aunt ( Judith Anderson ) and years later , with Martha now pushing him , Douglas as the local District Attorney sees to it that an innocent man is convicted of the crime and hanged . Stanwyk has inherited the factory and glories in her wealth and power , but Douglas , though he loves her , has never been able to forgive himself for his part in what is now two deaths . This is the mess that Van Heflin stumbles into . It's a long time being established . Nothing much happens for the first forty minutes or so , except that the cynical but basically good-hearted Heflin picks up Lizabeth Scott , she of the husky contrabass voice , perpetual pout , and coarse demeanor . But Scott is of no particular importance to the plot except to act as Heflin's conscience . That conscience is tested when he runs into his old friends Stanwyk and Douglas . The first thing Stanwyk does after shaking hands with Heflin is to put moves on him , which he fends off . Douglas hears about this and hires four or five goons to kidnap Heflin and rearrange his face . Then Stanwyk and Douglas , wondering what Heflin is sticking around town for , conclude that he is there to blackmail them for the crime they committed when they were teens . They ask him how much he wants . Then it begins to get really confusing because Heflin appears to accommodate himself to their assumptions , finally asking Stanwyk for half ownership in the factory . To her , it sounds like a pretty good idea . She and Heflin could go far - - if only they could somehow get rid of that drunken husband of hers . And that's all we hear of the blackmail business . It's never mentioned again . Stanwyk throws herself on Heflin once more and this time succeeds . At least we assume she succeeds . They're out in the woods and he grabs her and smothers her with kisses . The camera cuts to her hand dropping a flaming faggot into the camp fire . Dissolve . The fire is reduced to smoldering ashes . ( This was directed by Lewis Milestone , who should have stuck to war movies . ) There is a final confrontation between the three of them . Douglas drunkenly spills the beans on Stanwyk . Beans that Heflin has previously been unaware of . In disgust , Heflin leaves the two of them and stalks out into the night , calling them both "" sick . "" What keeps the movie interesting is the acting . The three principals are quite good . Interesting to see Kirk Douglas playing a wuss . Another few years and Van Heflin would have been cast as the drunk ( cf . , "" Madame Bovary "" and "" The Three Musketeers "" ) and Douglas would have been the tough skeptical gambler . Stanwyk , too , gives a good performance although why she was cast so often as the treacherous sex pot is beyond me . The role calls for an actress who can ooze heat , whereas Stanwyk's presence suggests a desk calculator . It's not so terrible a movie . It's not insulting to the audience . It's just rather dull , especially the first hour or so , during which nothing happens that would be of importance to any audience except one composed chiefly of snoops and gossips .

The end , also , is one of the happiest I've seen in Miyazaki's work ( if a little fuzzy with an angel flying high into the sky ) . On Your Mark tells of such a winged being who becomes prey to the horrors of civilization , plague , technology , when she only got there through a tremendous blunder . But when two men finally decide they've seen enough , they go through the security , through the swarms of bio-chemical suited soldiers , and through a desperate escape they make it through the explosions and action . All through this Miyzaki and his team create small wonders frame by frame , with small details like falling rocks just as fascinating as the large-scale amazements like the ' city ' at night in neon , or the shots of the getaway vehicle running along the highway , with the helicopters chasing afterwords . How or why this has happened to the angel is never made clear , but in such an amount of time Miyazaki can only show so much . What comes through best , in the end , is the immense talents of his team , his collaborators who transform such a near fairy tale into a one-of-a-kind show . The music , too , is a curious addition , as I don't think I would've cared for it much taken apart from the animation . With it , the song works on a romantically charged , epic scale ( if it were in English , I might've mistaken it for an 80s power ballad ) . It won't remain as a true landmark achievement for Miyazaki like Princess Mononoke , but if you're already a fan of his & / or Studio Ghibli's works and you can find it ( online is the best bet ) , it's more than worth it , it's a must-see .

Text2: The film gets credit for it's slow and deliberate pacing in the early going , as it builds suspense toward the revelation of the plot to destroy the Panama Canal . You had to wonder what all the intrigue and mystery was about regarding Clegg ( Paul Brinegar ) , Kroll ( John Mylong ) , Sam Wilton ( Leif Erickson ) and the film's title character Captain Trednor / Scarface ( Barton MacLane ) . It's not often you catch MacLane at the top of the credits , though he might have been upstaged in this one by Erickson as the hero of the piece . Still , he does a pretty good job when he's on screen , even if that German accent was somewhat distracting . The movie also did a nice job of explaining two key elements that might not have been offered in another film of the era where these kind of details weren't as important . For one , I was thinking about how the original Banos could have been blown up and disappeared without the authorities knowing , and that was handled competently by the Captain's explanation of Clegg's role to Wilton . Speaking of which , having Wilton's character portrayed as a former plantation foreman allowed for his proficiency with a machete . Too bad though about Mrs . Dilts , she seemed like a nice lady . That's not to say the picture didn't have it's share of outlandish elements . An atomic bomb on board a banana freighter ? - I don't think so . And how did Scarface manage to secure all the right scientific looking equipment on board the fake Banos without some knowledge of atomic bomb technology ? No need to get into that . Say , keep an eye on the handful of scenes starting with Wilton taking out the Captain up to breaking into the radio room with Crofton ; the sweat stains on his shirt and the bruise on his face change size and shape a number of times . Makes one wonder why those scenes weren't filmed one right after another . On balance though , I have no problem recommending this film for devotees of mystery and espionage , especially as a throwback to a time when Communist ideology threatened the very existence of the Western world - remember all those duck and cover drills in elementary school ? Ah yes , the 1950's , you had to be there .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
490,"Text1: My summary line above is an actual quote from the movie . The surprise of course is whether you ever make it through the entire flick . Let's see - 1977 , "" Star Wars "" , and 1977 , "" Cosmos : War of the Planets "" . One is a landmark movie that took sci-fi film making into the twenty first century , the other set back the progress of civilization for time immemorial . My question is - Is this movie about anything at all ? It's virtually an endless stream of darkened scenes where crew members of a space ship called ' MK 31 ' attempt to defeat an alien intelligence that threatens Earth . The alien intelligence actually states to Captain Hamilton ( John Richardson ) that it will conquer the galaxy when he repairs a bad circuit board . So what does he do - he repairs the bad circuit board ! ! ! ! The only redeeming factor for this mess is the go-go style space suits , all white with a red skull cap and trim that look particularly fine on the good looking female crew members . Other than that , this film goes where no film has gone before , and will stay there by the look of the comments already posted . Fortunately or not as the case may be , this was the last movie left to view of my fifty DVD sci-fi collection from Mill Creek / Tree Line Films . A bargain at about twenty five bucks , this is the kind of movie that demands a refund , even if it's only fifty cents .

Text2: A formerly unproductive gold mine suddenly turns out to be highly profitable ; it's owner Manning insists someone is out to murder him . He turns to Charlie Chan ( Roland Winters ) for help , and the Oriental detective and his two assistants , Number # 2 Son Tommy ( Victor Sen Yung ) and driver Birmingham Brown ( Mantan Moreland ) embark on a pseudo Western adventure . The story is set in Arizona , and to downplay suspicion in their involvement , the Chan party heads off to the Lazy Y Dude Ranch , from where they can keep an eye on developments at the Golden Eye Mine . Sen Yung and Moreland make quite a sight in their Western attire , particularly Birmingham in his buffalo inspired jodhpurs . Tim Ryan is back in a reprise of his role as Lieutenant Mike Ruark ( The Shanghai Chest ) , but this time he's undercover as teetering lush Vincent O'Brien at the Lazy Y . He's there independently , but it turns out his investigation runs parallel to Chan's , so they use the coincidence to hook up . It turns out that the Golden Eye is a pass through for a gold smuggling operation originating in Mexico . The obvious brains of the smuggling gang appears to be the mine's superintendent Driscoll , but as usual for a Chan mystery , the obvious is always done one better , in this case , the mastermind is the handsome local assayer Talbot Bartlett ( Bruce Kellogg ) , who's only too happy to assist Chan in any way he can so that he can throw him off the mark . Bartlett is also busy courting Manning's daughter Evelyn ( Wanda McKay ) to be better positioned to remove the mine's owner from the picture . "" The Golden Eye "" is an average Charlie Chan mystery , made somewhat more interesting with the comedic bits by Mantan Moreland and the quite effective interplay of Tim Ryan's drunken character O'Brien . If you're a Charlie Chan fan , you'll have to add this one to your list .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

In other words fairly pleasant , fairly harmless movies , like Venus , Shameless , Junebug , Waitress etc that fill a gap but , like Chinese food , leave you craving something more substantial within the hour . Hunter and Hunsinger scored a mild success with Lawless Heart and return to the same general area and clearly figure that if outrageous coincidence was good enough for Shakespeare it's good enough for them thus we get a chain of events in which Bob Hoskins , on the strength of an meeting Shaun Eveans for an hour or two and taking a shine to his mother , Lesley Manville , offers Evans the use of a flat in London which leads to Evans finding work as a waiter and catching the eye of PR honcho Stockard Channing with whom he is soon doubling as a gigolo where he in turn catches the eye of a girl his own age who , surprise , surprise , turns out to be Channing's daughter ; Channing has never disclosed the name of the father and as Dorothy Parker said you could have knocked me down with a fender when he is finally revealed as Hoskins ' brother . With story lines like these you need decent thesping and on the whole that's what we get with the glaring exception of leading man Shaun Evans compared to whom an amoeba with Learning Difficulties would eclipse Errol Flynn in both charm and charisma . Luckily Evans is surrounded by Manville , Hoskins , Anthony Head and Amanda Ryan all of whom help to make the time pass pleasantly enough .

Text2: What Mike Maltese , long Termite Terrace's best writer , was doing working for Walter Lantz for one movie , I have no idea - - he may have been feuding with hated producer Selzer , because he spent two or three years bouncing hither and yon until he settled in with Hanna-Barbera - - but this mild satire of rock-and-roll music is peppered with impeccably timed gags , a hallmark of Maltese's scripts in the past . Which argues that that was all that Woody Woodpecker was lacking in this period , because after this it was largely back to the usual sluggish stuff , largely fit for kids . But a good director would probably have helped too . It also helps when the art looks good , and while the animation had been too simple for several years , there is some nice background art on this one .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

494,"Text1: This was directed and co-written by Joseph Mankiewicz . The cast includes John Hodiak and Richard Conte . Almost all the scenes are shot at night around Los Angeles and on the lot . It ought to be good but in fact it's no more than routine . Let's recall John Huston's superb "" The Maltese Falcon , "" in which the hero , Sam Spade , is hired to find a fabulously expensive statue of a bird whose trip through time has left a trail of dead bodies behind . Spade searches for the statue , discovering a little more about it each time he runs into the colorful and quirky figures that are associated with its pursuit . The Fat Man , the Gay Levantine , the dame with the past , the Gunsel - - they come crawling out of the woodwork , enough of them to make a minion . In the climactic scene they are all brought together in Spade's apartment , where all is explained . And they leave , only to have Spade ring up the police and clue them in , except for the Ambiguous Dame who is revealed as the chief villain . I suspect "" The Maltese Falcon "" must have provided the model for this dark mystery , though enough cosmetic surgery has been performed to disguise the features of the original mold . Instead of the mysterious "" black bird "" , John Hodiak , the man with no memory , pursues his own past and the two million dollars hidden somewhere within it . He runs into a gang of colorful and quirky characters . The Fat Man here is just a guy with a sinister face and a German accent and a classy phraseology . The Gunsel is a huge "" tub of lard "" who is barely able to string three sentences together . There's no Gay Levantine , but a few other characters make up for his absence . The Ambiguous Dame is split into her two constituents - - the louche broad who slings around French clichés and the honest , brave Nancy Guild who falls in love with Hodiak ( and vice versa ) two minutes after they meet . Hodiak is beaten up by the hoods , just as Spade was . At the end , he demands a "" fall guy "" for the police , just as Spade did . The hoodlum gang , instead of leaving , just shrug and their leader tells them philosophically that "" the jig is up . "" The friend turns out to be the real scheming murderer - - Spade's Ambiguous Dame there , a secondary but likable character here . The direction is okay . Mankiewicz was no slouch . And some of the writing is passable , as is Hodiak's performance as George Taylor and , especially , Lloyd Nolan's as the police lieutenant . The rest are pallid facsimiles . There are , in fact , too many quirky and colorful characters and none of them could act . Neither could Nancy Guild , although she was attractive enough . Hodiak's pursuit of his own identity , his pal Larry Cravat , and the two million bucks grows tiresome - - and confusing too . There are too many leads , too many red herrings . We watch Hodiak travel from place to place , mostly meeting with hostility from people who don't even know him , garnering little scraps of information which may lead somewhere , or maybe not . The musical score has no lilt to it . And the characters have only one note on their instruments , except for Nolan who delivers sarcasm and irony with effortless aplomb . Mankiewicz was to do much better , later on . These semi-noir mysteries were not his forte , though he made another one of them and that one , "" No Way Out , "" was pretty damned good .

Well - - Charlie Chaplin managed to do it once in a while , and Billy Wilder . Why shouldn't a couple of sitcom writers trip over the same splendid alembic ? Al comes home from work with a big smile and reveals that a shoe groupie has been patronizing his store daily . Peggy is jealous and orders the two kids , Bud and Kelly , to hide in the store and spy on him all day . Al arrives and , while his kids peep at him , he throws his jacket aside , takes a deep breath , spreads his arms expansively , and declares , "" Open for business ! "" Then he sits on a foot stool in the empty store , buries his face in his hands , and doesn't move a muscle for five hours . A fat lady puts a momentary end to his despair by giving him a chance to rebut her claim that the shoes she bought yesterday are cheap because they split at the seams . They're like an elevator , Al explains , there's a two-ton wait limit . How about if I nail them to the soles of your feet ? That will give you more traction in front of the ice wagon . Then the groupie enters , and she's a meal in a short skirt . She's brought a tray of muffins for Al and begs him breathlessly to tell her stories about shoes . Half way through a story , she moans , "" Don't stop now . "" Bud and Kelly are uncertain about telling Peggy . When Peggy demands to know what went on , Bud looks thoughtful and ponders the problem . We hear his voice over as he turns things over in his mind , then thinks : "" I wonder what Kelly's thinking . "" The camera pans to Kelly's giddy face and we hear HER voice over - - a cartoon voice sputtering , "" Cheery beery jelly bean , Bullwinkle . "" Bud finally tells Peggy that nothing happened . Al sat there for hours , then a fat lady came in , and that was all . "" Yeah , "" adds Kelly , "" and then a beautiful woman came in and Daddy ate her muffins . "" I won't go on with this , I don't think , because the second half doesn't have the ontological significance of the first , and because I don't want to spoil any more gags , but it's significant that when Al gets home , Peggy demands to know what happened .

495,"Text1: To be honest this movie was a real deception , after hearing all the positive stories about it . Guess I'm just not a fan . I remember watching "" Transformers "" as a kid and I remember playing with the toys with my friends at their house . But further more I really have no recollections of the series . Guess I was too young at the time when the "" Transformers "" were at their prime in the Netherlands . I remembered the basic main characters but that was about it . For anyone who isn't really that familiar with the ' 80's cartoon series , this can be a very confusing and even bad movie to watch . Really nothing is ever explained in this movie and everything is just taken for granted . Basically the entire movie is about the Autobots constantly fighting the Decepticons but in the movie it never gets clear way . The entire story lacks a purpose and the movie is just basically the one event after the other without bothering to explain anything , or even introduce the characters . I'm sure that the movie worked better in 1986 , when new "" Transformers "" animated series episodes were still being made and everybody was still really into the series and characters . The movie was perhaps perfect for its time but in todays perspective the movie is just silly and without a point . The ' 80's musical score makes the movie feel even more outdated ! The story is really the weakest thing about the movie . Sure , when compared to a animated series episode the story is more complex and bigger but nevertheless , for ' just ' a movie the story is just way too weak and simple . The movie also heavily ' borrows ' from the Star Wars movies with its story . For the fans this movie is a nostalgic trip to a great period of growing up with the animated series and the classic characters . They should be able to appreciate all of the characters and big battles in the movie but for a non-fan the movie simply just has very little entertainment to offer . The humor is underused and the most fun and interesting characters seems wasted in the story . Often characters are introduced quickly in the movie and they disappear out of just as quick ( often without a clear reason or explanation ) again . Still the characters are the reason why the movie still somewhat works out . All of the characters are highly imaginative and obviously have a long background with each other . But like I said before , all of the best and most interesting characters are wasted in the movie and the movie also has way too many characters in it for a 84 minutes short movie . For most part the animations look just the same as for the television show , with the exceptions of a couple of big battle sequences , that are detailed but at the same time also quite confusing to watch at times . Oh , and Orson Welles somehow also got mixed up in this . I'm really not surprised that he later regretted this and actually hated the movie . If you're a fan and grew up with the series , then by all means see this movie , already for nostalgic reasons alone but if you're just like me , a person who've seen some of the animated series episodes but it didn't made an huge or lasting impression on you , than you're really better of just skip viewing it .

Text2: Certain films , such as Hector Babenco's "" El pasado "" elicit a strong dislike by misguided users of this forum . Even more surprising , for a movie that had poor distribution and was seen by only a handful of viewers , is the amount of votes users of IMDb have sent . It appears a disgruntled person is pushing the negative response in the six comments , so far , for this picture . It's almost incredible that , in some cases more than 300 bad responses have been submitted for the first review that appears on this page , or that someone will go into such lengths to take such action . Abuse like this happens a lot with certain films when an individual , probably , takes it upon himself to make it appear the movie in question is even worse than what it is . That type of negativity should be watched by the panel in charge of IMDb . "" El pasado "" is based on a lengthy book of more than five hundred pages by Alan Pauls , an Argentine author . The director , and his collaborator , Marta Goes , must have gone through a painful process in order to bring the novel to cinematic terms . That said , the film is a character study of a man that had it all and didn't realize what he had , to begin with , and wastes his life while searching for a balance that will make sense of what fate had in store for him . When we first meet Rimini and Sofia , they appear a normal couple on their way to a party .

Since their split is amicable , Sofia even helps Rimini find an apartment , one would expect to have them see one another at times . Rimini falls in love with the beautiful young model Vera . Rimini appears to be happy , but his addiction to cocaine and the easy life in which he finds himself accompanying Vera , proves to be his own undoing . Vera , in a fit of jealousy , runs away from Rimini and is killed by a bus . Rimini finds comfort with the beautiful Carmen , a translator , who obviously likes him . The life they share is a cozy one . Rimini suddenly begins suffering from a strange case where he loses his ability to translate from one language into another .

What follows is a downward path where Rimini finds himself alone , unable to work and destitute , landing in jail at the height of his despair . Not all is lost for this man because Sofia , who still cares for him will reappear in his life and Rimini will accept his fate , at last . Hector Babenco got excellent work out of his cast .

Deadly serious , this film is almost too somber to be taken with a straight face since the narration often comes across as rather preachy and purple . Its pure propaganda in the "" we were right to try these people "" sort of way and is clearly biased against the defendants who had just set Europe aflame . The take is rather odd and unlike any thing that I've run across in American or in Western European films on the same subject . It seems to be trying to over explain why the leaders of Germany were tried , which in retrospect is painfully obvious . Its clear from the lean toward the Soviet take of events and of its lingering on the speeches by the Soviet prosecutors who was behind the film . Its not bad but the heavy handedness of the presentation becomes wearing after a while . If you keep in mind when the film was made its an intriguing look at how the events were viewed during their own historical period . However its probably too long at an hour , with its ponderous preaching taking away from any value the film might have had .

In a way this plays like a time traveling version of 84 Charring Cross Road with much of the story told simply through the letters . In some ways its a story of two isolated people connecting through time , even though there is no way they should be able to . I think that one review of the film I read was right in away in that this film is a weird sort of take on the IMing culture as well as anyone who spends too much time on the computer and so isolates themselves from human contact . ( This also has echoes of Voices of a Distant Star ) This is a very nice little romance about two people who at first think their connection is a joke and then find that they are somehow becoming friends . For the most part it manages to keep you from thinking about the problems that "" time travel "" stories usually engender . Basically if you give yourself over to it you'll have yourself a good time . This isn't to say that there aren't problems , there are . As I said the film deals with people who aren't connecting with each other and a good portion of the film is taken up by the two leads moving around not connecting to people . Yes they talk to people ( The girls best friend runs a manga store - and she does voice acting ) but mostly they are are off in their own little worlds . It gets rather tiring since it feels more like a play than a movie at times , the movie in the wrong frame of mind ( which I was in ) will make the movie seem much longer than its 95 minutes . ( Worse I thought I would jump a head . . . bad mistake since I had to go back to make sense of what I saw ) Still its a nice romance that moved me ( I'm not afraid to say I had a tear in my eye ) . Definitely worth seeing if you're so inclined . ( Higher if you're in the right frame of mind )","{""output"": ""YES""}"
500,"Text1: During WWII , Hollywood made a wide variety of training films meant to be shown only to the troops . Because of this , the jokes were often sexual and the language was distinctly "" non-Hollywood "" for the era . Some of the films are a bit dull , but the ones I enjoy seeing the most are the clever Pvt . Snafu films . They have a distinctly Warner Brothers flare - - the artwork and voice characterizations are pure Looney Toons . The only obvious differences ( apart from the adult content ) is that they were made in black and white . This time , the idiot , Pvt . Snafu is learning about the danger of booby traps . And , as usual , he gets himself killed as an object lesson to the soldiers ! My favorite gags involved Snafu trying to milk a camel and when he went in to a tent filled with what appeared to be gorgeous women ( all he wanted to do was smoke and play the piano ) . A cute film that is almost as funny as the earlier Snafu film about spies .

Text2: The Kindred opens to shots of a Porsche racing along a highway , it catches up with an old pick-up truck and gets held up . As it speeds past the pick-up the driver ( Benjamin J . Perry as Ben Perry ) shouts obscenities and honks his horn . Distracted he doesn't notice an obstruction ahead and crashes his Porsche . He is quickly freed from the wreckage and is taken to hospital . On the way the Paramedic ( Randy Harrington ) trying to save him suggests that he probably won't make it . Then the Ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van . The driver of the van , Jackson ( Jim Boeke as James F . Boeke ) beats the Paramedic up and steals the patient . The Ambulance driver , Harry ( Charles Grueber ) makes no attempt to stop him . Once the injured man has been placed into the van Jackson turns his attention to Harry whom seem to know each other . Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw ' last time ' . Jackson punches Harry to the floor and throws a bundle of money at him . The film then makes it perfectly clear we are in San Fransisco by showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge . Sharon Raymond is woken up by a phone call for her boyfriend Dr . John Hollins ( David Allen Brooks ) to inform him that his Mother , Amanda ( Kim Hunter ) who has recently had a heart attack has regained consciousness . Hollins works for a company called the ' Geneticell Corporation ' and is delighted at the news and heads off to see her . Once there she asks him to go back to his old childhood house in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all of her notes and experiments , especially the ' Anthony journals ' which Hollins has never heard of , she also claims that he has a brother named Anthony . Back at Geneticell , Hollins talks with a Dr . Phillip Lloyd ( Rod Steiger ) about his Mother as they had both worked together before they had a falling out with each other , and questions him about her research and if he knows of anyone called Anthony . He claims he knows nothing . When Amanda dies after a visit from the sinister Dr . Lloyd , Hollins decides to carry out his Mothers request and try to find out who Anthony is . While paying his final respects at the funeral a woman named Melissa Leftridge ( Amanda Pays ) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a big admirer of his Mothers work and research after she helped her . Because Melissa seems to know so much about his Mothers work he invites her to the house as she may possibly be able to help find some answers to various questions he has . Hollins , Sharon , Melissa and three lab assistants , Brad Baxter ( Peter Frechette ) , Hart Phillips ( Timothy Gibbs ) and Cindy Russell ( Julia Montgomery ) plus a girl with a watermelon ( ! ) named Nell Valentine ( Bunki Z , great name what were her parents thinking ! ? ) . They get down to business straight away but find little of any interest . For some reason no one at this point thinks to look in the basement , which is just as well as there's something down there , something large , slimy and has lots of tentacles . First it kills Duke , the dog . Then it moves on to larger prey . When Hart is attacked by something in a barn Hollins decides he must destroy all traces of his Mothers work and whatever Anthony is . Jointly co-written and directed by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow , Carpenter also acted as cinematographer and Obrow as producer . This is a pretty poor film in my opinion . The script is credited to five ( ! ) writers , Carpenter , Obrow , Earl Ghaffari , John Penny and Joseph Stefano and with five people working on it I'd like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this . Nothing is explained that well , why did Amanda create these monstrous sea creature / human hybrids ? What is Dr . Lloyd's interest and his motives ? Why does he steal bodies from the back of Ambulance's ? Why does he have a basement full of mutants ? Why do none of these so-called genetic scientists think to check the basement out ? Could Melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried ? Why are none of the characters given any background ? Why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called Hemocynine when 99 . 9 % of the audience isn't going to have clue what their on about ? There is also a serious lack of blood and gore , only one person dies on screen , just one ! And all the scientists survive in a vomit inducingly mushy ' happy ending ' . This is a horror film guys , all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways . The one on screen death is actually quite cool , someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin , in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence . To try and up the gore quotent there is a scene where Dr . Lloyd is experimenting on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds , and in the context of the rest of the film doesn't mean a thing . Melissa also turns into a fish , don't ask . There's no nudity either , which isn't a surprise . The film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and plods along at a snails pace , we don't even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late , when it does make an appearance the effects are OK and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasn't used more . Overall I was very disappointed and I was expecting a lot better . A horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total , what's the world coming too ?","{""output"": ""NO""}"

503,"Text1: Outstanding biography of our nation's 33rd president . While it was becoming apparent that Harry Truman was failing at everything he did , when it came to the presidency , he succeeded more than anyone could imagine . The documentary showed how Truman went into politics thanks to Boss Pendergast . It depicted the dilemma that Truman found himself in . Wanting to do right as the county commissioner but tied to the strings of this malevolent boss . Truman may have been a footnote in senate history had it not been for his work on showing corruption in defense in the 1940s . The work that he did on the committee certainly caught the eye of President Roosevelt . Though it is said that Roosevelt didn't think much of Sen . Truman , it is hard to believe that despite Roosevelt's failing health , that he didn't care who the Democratic bosses picked as his running mate in 1944 . We have to say thank the Lord for the bosses . Had Vice President Henry Wallace been renominated for V . P . , this country would have been in a lot of difficulty . What a tumultuous presidency Truman would have with the threatened railroad strike , use of the a-bomb to end World War 11 , Berlin blockade and Korea . When Truman left office in 1953 , his approval rating was 32 % . History has judged him a lot better than that .

Text2: This is an Italian "" Jaws "" ripoff with minor adjustments . Our setting is Africa , I guess , since there's cobras , hippos , monkeys , etc . The gist is that there's a resort , somewhere in the deep jungle , where lame tourists can come and act like they're at a disco in the city . Now there is a peaceful native tribe nearby , and they've been co-opted into working and doing things for the owners of the resort . Quite a change from most Italian films , as in , they're not busy eating anyone for the majority of the picture . That's left to the big thing that lives in the river . Seems that the resort people have angered a great god who takes the shape of a Big Alligator ( hence the title ) and rampages around eating anything it can get into its maw . At one point a tourist boat is compromised , as in , everyone must disembark , and it's over some spiky fence into a lagoon to safety , but the alligator is on one side and natives shooting burning arrows are on the other side .

Text2: I had heard the title many times , and then I found out that the twice Oscar winning female star of The Silence of the Lambs was in it , and I thought why not . Set in the 1930's , this story is loosely based on the gangster exploits ( e . g . Al Capone ) during the Prohibition era , but all characters are played by children , no adults at all , unless you count the singing voice of Paul Williams . Basically the film centres on the ongoing gang battle between ( named because of his physique ) Fat Sam ( John Cassisi ) and ( named because of his classy fashion sense ) Dandy Dan ( Martin Lev ) , and both are fighting to have the best weapons to take out their threats , i . e . the custard pies , and the essential "" splurge gun "" . Bugsy Malone ( Scott Baio ) is around during this conflict , he starts as a bystander , a penniless boxing promoter down on his luck , but he gets a job for Fat Sam as a driver , and he agrees to help with whatever he wants . Bugsy also meets his love interest , Blousey Brown ( Florrie Dugger ) , who is ambitious to be a film star in Hollywood . Bugsy makes the money she needs to take her their , but he is mugged and money stolen . He was rescued after this mugging by Leroy Smith ( Paul Murphy ) , who has boxing talent , so Bugsy trains him as a boxer , and Leroy becomes his unofficial sidekick .

Brandy ) gives birth in the candle lit basement belonging to a group of dubious character's who worship Michael because he is some sort of druid incarnation of evil & these turkeys protect him & perform all sorts of dodgy rituals & you just know this film is going to be crap from this opening sequence . Anyway , a kind hearted druid nurse ( Lee Ju Chew ) gives Jamie her baby back & lets them escape but the main man himself Michael Myers is in hot pursuit , I have no idea where he came from or how he knew what was going on but hey I guess the screenwriters thought we wouldn't care ( they were right ) . Michael ends up killing Jamie but discovering that she hid her baby somewhere en-route , since all Michael wants to do is kill all his relatives ( don't laugh I feel like this all the time ! ) for various preposterous reasons he is determined to head back to Haddonfield to kill the folks in his old house including a cousin of Laurie Strode , Kara ( Marianne Hagan ) & hunt down Jamie's baby even though he couldn't have a clue where it is , as luck would have it Tommy Doyle ( Paul Rudd ) the guy across the street , who also has a tenuous link to the original as he was a babysitter or something , found Jamie's baby & has taken it back home where Michael is lurking not far away across the street . . . Directed by Joe Chappelle I thought Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers was a boring & confusing entry in the Halloween franchise that currently numbers 9 & should have stopped at Halloween III : Season of the Witch ( 1982 ) which at least tried to be different & original . The script by Daniel Farrands is an absolute mess & when you consider the various production problems that took place it's no surprise , for instance the script apparently went through 11 drafts ( & they still ended up with this ? ! ) , Donald Pleasence died before the film was released & many of his scene were edited out , the usual ' creative differences ' between director , producer & studio & really bad test screenings prompted re-shoots & heavy re-editing . The whole sorry situation has mess written all over it , the stupid ideas about druid cults , star constellation's , Michaels origins & lots of unnecessary nonsense that I suppose was included to try & stretch the flimsy series out even more although ironically the next film in the series Halloween H20 : 20 Years Later ( 1998 ) totally ignored Holloween : The Curse of Michael Myers & it's absurd ideas . The film moves along at a fair pace , there are a few decent scenes when taken individually but as a whole the film really is a mess & it looks like it was pieced together using outtakes . Oh & since when do Hospitals leave machetes lying around ? Director Chappelle has a nice style going on here , cool neon blues as lightening flash , some good angles & camera moves means that it's a fine looking film . Unfortunately this means that the film looks very staged , one of the reasons why the original Halloween ( 1978 ) was effective was because of it's simplicity . There isn't much gore , someone is impaled on some farm machinery , an exploding head , a slit throat & a few spurts of blood . Most of the character's feel very secondary & things are never rounded off with any satisfaction . With a budget of about $5 , 000 , 000 it has that Hollywood polish & it looks good throughout . The acting isn't up to much but at least there are no rap ' stars ' in it , Pleasence looks really old & disinterested ( much like the audience by the time this thing finishes ) . Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers is not for me , maybe there are people out there who love it & that's fine but for me it's a definite miss . Not particularly recommended & for die-hard Halloween fans only . According to the IMDb's ' Trivia Section ' many of the cast & crew were angry at all the changes , problems & re-shoots with them vowing never to make another Halloween film again ( you know what I'm going to say ) , well we all have to be grateful for small mercies I suppose !

Text2: This is your typical average overdone MGM drama , with a sappy story and a fluffy look and feel all over it . Nevertheless , everything in it is done well enough to make this a good ( enough ) genre movie to watch . The movie is needlessly told as a flashback , which also makes us the viewers already aware of how the main story ends , in advance . Sometimes in cases this approach works well for a story but not for such a mediocre movie as this one I'm afraid . In the midst of all the formulaic drama there are some fine actors in the movie , that get to shine . Elizabeth Taylor is really great and to me she was the one that truly carried the movie , though in screen time it is perhaps Van Johnson who plays the real main role of the movie . The movie also has a supporting cast to die for ; Walter Pidgeon , Donna Reed , Eva Gabor and even a young Roger Moore in his first real notable movie role . I just wish that some of the character development would had been better though . Also the ' relationship ' between Charles Wills and Marion Ellswirth never gets developed well enough , though it plays an essential part in all of the drama in the movie , especially in the beginning and toward the ending of the movie . The movie is really typical for MGM ' 50's standards , meaning that the drama is heavy but the approach of it isn't always . The movie at times tends to be more cheerful than dramatic , which isn't always for the movie its own benefits . Toward the end the drama thickens , which especially gives the movie its ' overdone ' feeling , which also doesn't exactly make the movie more believable to watch . It's still a good enough drama to watch , just not one that will grab you . The movie uses some fine settings . Of course Paris is the perfect backdrop for a romantic movie and they used some nice locations in the movie ( not the Eiffel tower for a change , even though it's still featured on the movie its cover ) . Also the costumes are quite nice . Good enough for its genre and MGM ' 50's standards but that doesn't exactly mean that it's a highly recommendable one though .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Here is John Brown ( a real historical figure played by Raymond Massey ) demanding money from Boston abolitionists ( also real ) just before the Civil War . Give me the money , he shouts , and I'll start a slave revolution in the upland South . He knows that country . It's filled with hiding places for guerrilla warriors . So he and his handful devoted followers take over the federal arsenal and settle down in Harper's Ferry , Virginia . The tiny town was , and is , a sinkhole at the confluence of two rivers . If you stand in the main street of Harper's Ferry and look in any direction , all you see are tall wooded hills looming over you . It's about the least defensible place on the planet . There are a few African-Americans in the movie . The script has one of them say something like : "" Mistuh Brown , he promised us da freedom . But if dis here Kansis is freedom , I wants to go back to Texas where Ah kin live mah lahf in PEACE . "" You bet . However , let us skip over the anachronisms - - the absence of muskets , the presence of generic Colt pistols , the fact that Jeb Stuart ( Errol Flynn ) , George Armstrong Custer ( Ronald Reagan ) , Bell , Sheridan , Longstreet , Hood , and Pickett didn't graduate from West Point in the same year - - and examine the movie as a Ding an Sich . The errors of time are lost in the headlong pace of this Western . And it IS a Western , though some scenes are set in the East . There is never any doubt who the good guys are . They're the ones who shoot their pistols jauntily , without aiming , and hit their targets . John Brown and his followers are bad guys , yes , but with mitigation , your Honor . His passion to free the slaves was all right , but his violent methods were all wrong . Every Western , though , must have a genuinely evil guy and in this case it's Van Heflin . His character seems lashed together in haste . At West Point , before he's thrown out , he reads treasonous literature to the other cadets and gets into fist fights ( with Flynn ! ) over the issue of slavery . By the end , he's revealed as a craven money-grabber who only joined Brown's movement for the moolah , and when it's denied him he squeals on Brown to the government . That's known as discontinuity . I speak here not of historical inaccuracy but of dramatic clumsiness . God help me , my phraseology has been contaminated by listening to John Brown's dialog . You ought to see this movie if only for Raymond Massey's overblown portrait of John Brown . He never blinks .

The delightful Olivia de Havilland plays "" Kit Carson "" Halliday , the girl Flynn marries while rival Reagan stands by , shrugs good-naturedly , and smiles . The real Custer later married a smashing brunette named Libby , almost as attractive as de Havilland . It's a straightforward Warners production with Flynn , Reagan , Michael Curtiz , Max Steiner , Perc Westmore , and Sol Polito all hard at work in the factory , turning out their fast , unpretentious , actioners and dramas in their classic style .

Text2: There have been myriad films about whistle blowers since the success of "" Serpico "" - - and before ( eg . , "" On the Waterfront "" ) . Some , like those mentioned , are quite well done . Others are Hollywoodized to the point of staged but fake reality and one hundred percent predictability . I won't mention any . Well , I will - - "" The Insider "" - - done strictly by the buck , I mean the book . Here's a film from Argentina about a pilot ( Enrique Pineyro ) , a guy nobody in the major film audience ever heard of , with a handsomeness quotient the equal of a soft-boiled egg , who quietly complains to his friends , his colleagues , and his bosses about the slack way regulations are enforced by his airline company , LAPA . Whatsmore , the real Enrique Pineyro is played by the real Enrique Pineyro . His reports about equipment failure and corner cutting do nothing but get him into trouble . There is a government investigation ongoing , but the investigation isn't getting any help from LAPA executives , who want to expand the company , or from LAPA's pilots who are afraid of losing their jobs and guarded about the possibility of failure being attributed to "" pilot error , "" something which no professional pilot wants to admit , or even talk about . Somebody fills the investigator's car with gum balls . And when that doesn't discourage him , a few bullets are sent his way through the window of his home . Pineyro wants nothing more than to fly - - and for him and his co-workers to be able to do it in safety . He writes a letter about his working conditions and sends it to - - get this - - the New York Times , who publish it in a front-page article . This leads to the resignation of the chief executives and their replacement by a bunch of clones who continue the same corrupt practices . Pilots are supposed to take regular vacations because a tired pilot is a threat to safety , but LAPA isn't giving them the time off that the law requires . In one case , the company owes a pilot SIX YEARS worth of vacations . In extremis , Pineyro resigns from LAPA and takes all the information he has to the government investigator , who then accesses all the company's files and reports , but not before a fatal accident occurs , due to lack of oversight . We don't get to see the accident . We don't get to see ANY accidents . Hardly anyone shouts at anyone else . Pineyro , aside from the ordinariness of his appearance , is perfectly ordinary . I swear that non-Hollywood productions have this eerie capacity for picking non-magnetic people for lead roles who have a talent for demonstrating just how good they are at playing their roles . Has anyone taken a close look at Daniel Auteuil's face lately ? Or Jean Gabin's ? It's not a zapped-up whistle-blower movie . The score is so sparse as to be hardly noticeable . ( Excellent use is made of a piano piece I once picked up on my car radio . I figured it was by Mozart and I recognized the form as variations on a theme , but I couldn't make out the theme because it was so disguised . I couldn't wait for its restatement at the end , imagining it would be elegant and sophisticated . It turned out to be "" Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star . "" ) There are quite a few shots of the pilot and copilot at the controls of the big Boeing they fly , and they're great , with the comfortably lighted control panel in the foreground and the magnificent city lights beyond the windshield . There is no mock up of the flight deck . All the shots are done during flight . As far as I could tell , none of the other scenes were shot in a studio either . You really don't want to watch this if you have anything against subtitles , even though the flight language is English - - "" gear up , "" "" seat belts on , "" and so forth . And you don't want to watch it if you're easily bored if nobody thrusts his hand down a victim's throat and yanks out his bleeding pyloric sphincter . If you want heroism , high drama , car chases , and fast editing , this isn't your cup of yerba mate . But if you want a glimpse into how the real world of the bureaucracy works , you might learn from this one .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

511,"Text1: Steve Coogan is irresistibly entertaining in this offbeat film - a movie within a movie that crosses portions of a fine novel with the machinations if turning that novel into a film . Yes , this has been done successfully before , but rarely with the loonieness and candor that suffuses this entertaining insider look at making a novel visual . Director Michael Winterbottom and the entire cast and crew making the film Tristram Shandy follow a script ( by Frank Cottrell Boyce ) , but in a manner that feels like extemporaneous commentary on the 18th century Lawrence Sterne novel . Steve Coogan is introduced as the makeup artists are altering his nose and facial features to reflect those of Tristram while his co-star Rob Brydon is being transformed into the character of Captain Shandy . From conversations about technical aspects of shooting a film the camera splices into actual scenes from the ' movie ' , most of which deal with the birthing of Tristram . The purpose of the film reflects an aspect of the book about a man who is attempting to delve into the history and actions that result in the creation of the title character . The cast is strong : in addition to Coogan and Brydon , the minor roles are filled by Jeremy Northam , Kelly Macdonald , Shirley Henderson , Benedict Wong , Keeley Hawes , Gillian Anderson , Naomie Harris in addition to the costumers and makeup artists as well drawn characters in and of themselves ! For many the film may feel disjointed and meandering , but give into the concept of the delightful mix of shortcuts enhanced by commentary from the actors and crew and this Cock and Bull story is a terrific costume period piece romp . It is just meant to be fun and full of chuckles . Grady Harp

Text2: Yes , if the movie was just arm wrestling it would be kind of hard to make the entire movie revolve around it and still be motion picture length . So how do you fill the rest of the time up , you add the touching story of a man trying to reunite with the son he left for his mother and grandfather to raise long ago . A plot straight from the lifetime movie channel that makes all the growling and yelling at the arm wrestling tournament all the more stupid . The saving grace of this movie is the rather good soundtrack . The music is good and saves this otherwise to sappy and overemotional movie . The arm wrestling tournament at the end is full of colorful characters , but they are not really delved into because we are busy trying to have the son driving to the matches to see his dad and they can have the sappy reunion . We get lots of arguing between father and son , mother and grandfather , grandfather and father this and that and we get a big migraine . Perhaps this is to better distract us from things that happen in the matches such as Hawks ( Stallone's character ) being in the perfect grid to face Bull Hurley in the final showdown or other strange occurrences like the fact Bull never seemed beaten at any time on his road to the finals . Of course , this type of movie is kind of Sylvestor's type is it not ? He had Rocky and some other sports themed movie about wrestling that is not quite as well known .

Text2: I knew TAXI was a French film with a screenplay by Luc Besson but that was all I knew about it . I speculated that since it was written by Besson we'd be seeing a very violent thriller but that's not what TAXI turned out to be since it's an entertaining comedy Pizza delivery boy Daniel Morales drives his own unlicensed taxi and one day makes the mistake of driving ( In his own illegal manner ) Emilien to his place of work which is bad news for Daniel because Emilien is a police inspector . Daniel is given the choice of helping the police catch a bunch of German bank robbers dubbed "" The Mercedes Gang "" or lose his driving license Did I say this was entertaining ? It's also very likable and much of that's down to Besson's screenplay which is devoid of the sometimes sickening violence which did spoil for me NIKITA and LEON and they only hint that it was written by Besson being the fact that policemen are stupid . You do get the impression from all of his movies that Besson has a pathological dislike of cops but thankfully he doesn't get too polemical this time . Director Gerard Pires complements the screenplay by casting two young and likable actors in the lead roles There are a couple of flaws to TAXI . While being the chase and crash sequences are well directed it's unlikely cars flip up into the air as seen here . There's also a plot hole in that if the cops know where the raids are going to take place they don't bring in helicopter surveillence , but again being a Besson script the police are portrayed as being terminally stupid so I don't know if it's a plot hole as such . One thing that did annoy me is Daniel and Emilien sharing a joint which is a scene that certainly wasn't needed in the filmBut I saw several films the day I saw this and TAXI was undoubtedly the best movie I saw that day .

513,"Text1: This is the first official cinematic account of necrophiliac mama's boy Ed Gein ( though the names have been changed ) ? for the record , he was the source for PSYCHO ( 1960 ) ' s Norman Bates , while the same year as DERANGED another established genre classic , THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE , drew on his notorious exploits . Incidentally , this viewing came via the German Special Edition DVD which contains the infamous brain removal scene ( albeit in footage displaying inferior quality to the remainder of the film ) missing from the MGM / UA R1 disc . The film is well enough done , hinging on Roberts Blossom's excellent leading performance ( most creepy when he mimics his dead mother's voice ) ; however , the latter half ? in which he extends his activities to include murder ? elicit a genuine eeriness , which is remarkably similar to what Tobe Hooper would do with Texas CHAIN SAW ( especially when the sluttish barmaid stumbles into Blossom's house and is ' met ' by a ghastly dinner gathering of corpses , and the man himself in hideous make-up ! ) . The evisceration finale , then , contains the requisite dashes of nudity and blood-letting which post-Vietnam era theatergoers ? and genre fans in particular ? had grown accustomed to by that stage . Still , one isn't quite sure how to react to Ezra Cobb ( the Gein figure ) ? which makes for somewhat detached viewing ( of course , for all their faults , one is more readily sympathetic towards his victims ' plight ) and , this , in spite of intermittent asides / interjections by a geeky narrator grounding the events in a solid reality . There is , however , a definite and agreeably comedic undertone to the scenes involving the fat lady-cum-mystic who persuades Cobb to attend a séance ostensibly to contact his late mother but which only exposes the woman's own essential loneliness ( to her ultimate dismay ) . By the way , the film was made by several associates of late Canadian director Bob Clark ( DEATHDREAM [ 1974 ] , BLACK Christmas [ 1974 ] , MURDER BY DECREE [ 1979 ] , etc . ) ? including composer Carl Zittrer , whose work here adds yet another layer of unease to the proceedings .

Text2: Basically the story of a duel of wits between a German submarine captain ( Helmut Griem ) , ranking officer in a Scottish POW camp , and an Irish captain in the British army ( Brian Keith ) who is sent to administer the camp and investigate the reasons for the POWs riotous behavior . It develops that Griem is organizing the escape of 28 submariners because Germany needs experienced crewmen . The escape is successful . It leaves poor Brian Keith behind . Until the very end , that is , when the escapees are discovered boarding a U-boat off the Scottish coast and , alerted by Keith , a British patrol boat interferes with the escape . The U-boat submerges with most of the escapees aboard already , but it leaves Griem and a few others behind in their rubber boats . Keith , watching the events from atop a cliff , is given the last words . "" Well , Willi , it looks like both you and I are in the house . "" Interesting film in which nobody really wins . One or two dozen German sailors manage to get away , but to what ? Another U-boat patrol ? After May , 1943 , those patrols were suicide missions . And it's unusual to see Brian Keith , as a genial , quiet , thoughtful Irishman outwitted by a ruthless German like Griem . And he IS ruthless . Unnecessarily ruthless . One of those dedicated Nazis who kills his comrades without compunction in order to ensure the success of his mission . The role is really pretty retrograde , harking back as it does to the Gestapo spies of the 1940s . Other than his tendency to humiliate and kill such skanks as homosexuals , Griem , with his handsomeness and overall Aryan quality , exudes a good deal of charm . He and Keith listen to a recording of Beethoven's third symphony . "" Toscanini ? "" asks Griem . Keith nods and comments with a smile , "" Furtwangler did it better .

Most impressive is the lack of rampant cgi effects or cgi monsters . I do believe the one's with the tongues are the only totally cgi monsters in the movie .

They play two hopeless bozos - cops , no less - who perform an undercover operation for the governor by posing as new prisoners at a Southern institution so that they may extract the whereabouts of a large amount of cash from senile veteran prisoner Butch ( Hank Worden ) . I know Conway has got a lot of credentials , but I think he blew it with this one , which he wrote himself . This so-called comedy is quite flat , eliciting no laughs at all from me for most of its running time . Even the scene that should be uproarious - the scene where the squeamish Dewey ( Conway ) tries to inject Warden Warden ( Dub Taylor ) with Novocaine - I viewed with indifference . There is lots of slapstick & farce , and there are broad cartoon-like performances , but much of it just didn't pique my interest .

Said heroes include a paleontologist , Dr . Jackson ( William Hopper ) , his associate , Marge Blaine ( Alix Talton ) , and stoic Col . Parkman ( Craig Stevens ) . It might not rank right up there with two of my favorite classics from the period - "" Them ! "" and "" Tarantula "" - but "" The Deadly Mantis "" is really not a bad movie at all . It has the same reliance on dialog ( full of exposition ) as many of the other movies from the period , and isn't as interesting when the monster isn't doing its thing , but it holds up fairly well . The special effects are rather decent ( this monster is at the least more convincing than that Muppet-like alien buzzard in "" The Giant Claw "" ) , maybe not so much when the monster is seen in long shot , but they're good enough , and the movie is well done and , for me , anyway , not in the least laughable . Some sequences late in the movie work particularly well , when the monster is on the loose in the fog , and the climax in the Manhattan Tunnel , when it's easy to start feeling some pity for the monster .

There's a limit to how much the human eye can take before it starts suffering from snow blindness , in fact the cold snowy landscape depressed this viewer more than anything else . Oh and because of the plot we treated to lots of simplified ex positional dialogue for the benefit of a mass audience who don't know the first thing about Uncle Joe Stalin . Exposition in a book is one thing because you can dedicate many pages of characters thought process , but watching it on a television screen means the characters and dialogue come off as unnatural But ironically it's Harris's plot where everything comes apart - Stalin had a son who no one knows about and is trying to force the new Russia into communist dictatorship again . Sorry I don't buy that due to the gaps in logic . Communism wasn't founded under Stalin nor did it end with the death of Stalin so why the big deal about new communism on the march ? And why would killing Stalin Jnr signal the end of a potential communist era ? The flaws with this political thriller are the same as the ones of Ira Levin's novel about Hitler being cloned .

Text2: This work could be the strongest contender for this title . It's incredible that the Poiraud brothers were able to find a bucketful of producers to finance their hare-brained project . Maybe because they feared to see where all the millions of Euros had gone , they didn't want to see the finished product before it opened in France in the summer 2004 and one could add in particular conditions . There were neither screenings for the specialized press in cinema nor trailers on the telly or at the movies . Personally , I remember very well when I went to see "" Spider-Man 2 "" ( 2004 ) at the theaters . In the corridor leading to the room , I noticed a cover of the film but I didn't pay much attention at all about it . I didn't have the single inkling of the contents of the Poiraud's product . Anyway , their work was bound to disappear from the French theaters after a few weeks of screening . Commercial suicide in all its splendor which can be easily explained . How can you expect to make audiences flock to an amorphous story ? At a pinch , the most curious ones might have been interested to have a look at it . . . I must admit that it's not that much bad . Okay , anyone who will label this movie as a masterwork will be a liar and at first sight one would like to hammer "" Atomik Circus : Le Retour De James Bataille "" and to relegate it to purgatory but there are some valuable plus sides one can save from this wreckage . About the title : is it a misnomer ? Given the various ingredients the Poiraud brothers put in their dish , one could agree that it's a real circus they have concocted . And what about James Bataille ? Actually , one doesn't see him for nearly the half of the movie . He has just a few lines to say and the moments during which he has the meatiest part of his role finds itself at the end of the movie , especially during a fight . It is funny when one knows that Bataille means "" fight "" in French . The outset of the film takes us to Skotlett , a lost dump where one wouldn't want to spend one's holidays populated with inhabitants with a redneck mentality . The tail end showcases a desert landscape which seems directly taken from "" Planet of the Apes "" ( 1968 ) or even a part of "" Capricorn One "" ( 1978 ) , Peter Hyams ' best effort . Between the two , two different subplots . On the one hand , Conchia ( Vanessa Paradis ) who is eager to take a chance in music . She's spotted by an unscrupulous manager Alan Chiasse ( Benoît Poelvoorde ) who's more interested in her look than her potential as an artist . On the other hand , James Bataille ( Jason Fleyming ) who strives to come back to Skotlett to find again her fiancée Conchia . Two conventional subplots which culminate with an invasion of aliens and it's virtually a rehash of the sci-fi of the fifties crossed with horror ( there's blood galore and ripped bodies ) . If one plays the Poiraud brothers ' game , if one accepts this unlikely mix of distinct cinematographic genres in a preposterous story , if one accepts this hustle of the narrative conventions , not taken seriously "" Atomik Circus "" is rather fun to watch . While reading the two subplots , one could detect something conventional in them but the directors try to thwart it through the unexpected like the alien invasion for instance . Also conventional is the final fight between Bataille and Chiasse transformed in an alien . You probably guessed the winner but the story isn't over and the predictable side of what follows is defused by an unexpected twist in the tail end . These qualities mustn't make the lover forget that there are negative points in the Poiraud brothers'UFO . First , problems of rhythm : sluggish at the outset but wild with the carnage caused by the aliens . Then , two-bit tricks to bridge some steps of the story are difficult to swallow and the Poiraud brothers aren't virtuosos of the camera at all . There is a lot of hand-held camera , an amateur side and sometimes they botch the job . Same remark for a scenario which is sometimes ill-conceived . ( The first draft encompassed many other things which weren't tapped during the shooting ) . But if you're tired of walking safely in the landscape of French cinema , watch this mix of "" Romeo and Juliet "" and "" Mars Attacks "" ( 1996 ) as the press kit deemed it . It could have gained with a little more of attention and control . One last thing : the actors had fun by overplaying their characters who are real puppets . The cast includes Jean-Pierre Marielle who agreed to replace the sadly regretted Jean Yanne and I wonder what he would have done with his part . All of them said they really enjoyed the shooting and the vibe of the film and the set . You might also enjoy this film if you follow some of the possible instructions I mentioned earlier .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
520,"Text1: Leave it to Robert Altman to announce his return to Hollywood with a scathing indictment of it . After a decade of working in virtual anonymity , Altman made a comeback with this dark comedy , scoring his third Academy Award nomination as director and his first since "" Nashville "" nearly 20 years earlier . It's instantly recognizable as an Altman film - - the opening of the movie is an 8-minute tracking shot following various conversations about either story ideas or movies in general , including one about famous tracking shots from famous movies . Tim Robbins plays a self-absorbed producer who begins to receive death threats from an unknown writer whose idea Robbins ignored . As he becomes increasingly paranoid , the movie becomes increasingly like a nightmare , and the world of Hollywood begins to become more and more removed from the world of everyone else . Altman vents his frustration and disdain for the asinine business of making movies , even while he suggests that the business is worth putting up with in order to do what he loves . Pretty much everyone who had ever been in an Altman film to that point in time ( and many who hadn't ) have roles in this movie , some - - Peter Gallagher , Sydney Pollack , Vincent D'Onofrio , Whoopi Goldberg ( hilarious ) - - playing fictional characters while others - - too many to name - - play themselves . Robbins anchors the film though , with a great performance completely lacking in vanity . Only Altman would choose to do a full frontal male nude scene with the actor caked in mud . "" The Player "" is not actually one of my favorite Altman films , but it did signal his return to his typical large-scale ensemble format , and it allowed him to make "" Short Cuts , "" which IS one of my favorites , the very next year .

Text2: A gleefully macabre and intensely suspenseful movie based on the Lillian Hellman play . Bette Davis sinks her teeth into the role of icy bitch Regina Giddens with such relish that you can practically hear her sighing with satisfaction at getting away from the noble sufferer roles that had so recently made her famous in films like "" Jezebel "" and "" Dark Victory . "" She's monstrous here as the frigid wife of Herbert Marshall , waiting impatiently for him to die so that she can get her talons on his inheritance . A group of conniving brothers are trying to outsmart her and claim the inheritance for themselves , but they have no idea who they're dealing with . We ultimately can forgive Davis for her reptilian selfishness , because she's driven to it out of survival . If you want to play with the big boys , the movie seems to say , you have to learn to be one yourself . This is a lesson her sister-in-law , Birdie , hasn't learned , and as a result is a fluttering , neurotic mess of a woman , bulldozed by her husband and supreme example of exactly the kind of woman Regina refuses to be . Birdie is played by Patricia Collinge in a devastatingly heartbreaking performance . Just watch her in the scene where her husband slaps her ; you can almost literally see the life drain out of her as she accepts her misery as a cage from which she doesn't ever really hope , or feels she deserves , to escape . And as the moral conscience of the film , Teresa Wright plays Regina's daughter , Alexandra , slow to pick up on the treacherous games her own mother is playing . The classic scene in this film is the one in which Regina's husband actually dies . She's sitting feet away from him , watching him gasp for breath while refusing to get the medication that could save his life , and Davis's creepy , empty expression shows us just how little compassion or sympathy , or even any emotion other than greed and vengeance , remains in this grotesque , twisted creature .

After witnessing a brawl among visiting westerners ( "" Jackies "" ) , Mr .

There , Lillian Gish ( as Lucy ) lives with her "" Daddy "" - - abusive boxer Donald Crisp ( as Battling Burrows ) . Ms . Gish is treated like a slave in the Burrows hovel ; she is regularly whipped by hard-drinking Mr . Crisp .

Griffith has some fighting "" Anglo-Saxons "" disrupt the peaceful scenes , this foreshadows later developments and illustrates the main theme and relationship - - the Eastern / Western culture clash represented by Barthelmess and Gish . Of course , the meeting of the two is doomed . Barthelmess ' performance as an Asian has a sensitivity not present in subsequent attempts by big name "" Anglo "" actors to play "" Oriental "" parts ; with a lot of integrity , he plays shopkeeper Cheng Huan as an idealist Buddhist becoming a disillusioned pipe-smoker ( probably of Opium ) . Watch for Barthelmess ' reaction when a Christian missionary announces he is leaving for China to convert their heathen ; it's a classic revelation of maturity and understanding . His expertly played love for Gish shows up in his eyes as love , not lust ; this is the more difficult , but correct , way to play the part . Gish is likewise magnificent , creating one of her most memorable characterizations ; her motion of using two fingers to force upon her face a "" smile "" is classic ; her eyes reveal the horror behind her tear-aged face . Gish is great , sadly walking the Limehouse streets , collecting tin foil , and admiring unaffordable flowers and dolls . At home , she finds it increasingly impossible to avoid Crisp's abuse .

522,"Text1: The absolutely gorgeous color cinematography and the Academy Award winning sets are the main reason that you should Frenchman's Creek today . The players definitely take second place to those outstanding features . The plot at least as it has been altered by the Code is handled with as much skill as the cast can muster covering up some glaring holes . Joan Fontaine is one unhappily married lady of the manor with two small children and a husband who seems more intent on advancing his career in Restoration Great Britain than in her . As was the fashion of that bawdy era husband Ralph Forbes even encourages his wife to pay attention to the courting of his rakish friend Basil Rathbone to Fontaine . When at court many men even pimped their wives for Charles II , this behavior in that era isn't surprising . Well Fontaine can't stand Rathbone so she and the kids take off for the summer place on the Cornwall coast . There's a servant there with a French accent , Cecil Kellaway and later she learns it's been inhabited discreetly by French pirate Arturo De Cordova . He's quite the charmer , if the film were done at Warner Brothers Errol Flynn would have had the part . Joan and Arturo as a couple look like they come right out of one of those romance novels . She even takes up the cutlass with him and she proves to be every bit the swordsman he is . The title of the film comes from a hidden cove near Fontaine's manor where De Cordova's ship lays anchor . Other more recent versions of the story by Daphne Du Maurier have been made that are closer to the original . I can't reveal it , but the ending makes absolutely no sense at all . And it is NOT as Du Maurier wrote it originally . Maybe that was part of the reason that Mexican film idol Arturo De Cordova never got stardom north of the border . He appeared in this film , in a supporting role in For Whom the Bell Tolls and another Paramount feature and then went back to Mexico where he was a leading figure in Latino cinema for the next quarter of a century . De Cordova reminds me a lot of his fellow countryman , Gilbert Roland . Rathbone is a nasty villain and there's also a nice performance by Nigel Bruce as a fatheaded earl who is a Cornwall neighbor . It's the only time that Basil and Nigel did a film together not as Holmes and Watson . Mitchell Leisen directed this film and did a good job given the Code restrictions he operated under . Leisen early in his career worked on several Cecil B . DeMille films and his photography and sets definitely have a DeMille look to them . If you like romantic tales , despite the problems , Frenchman's Creek is one for you .

Text2: Tim Conway and Don Knotts proved to be so popular in the first Apple Dumpling Gang movie that the Magic Kingdom felt they had to be reteamed for The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again . Leaving behind the two children they were involved with in the first film , our two outlaw wannabes find themselves enlisting in the cavalry after unwittingly helping in a bank robbery . Conway and Knotts's fiddlefooted fumblings are happening at the same time that army supplies are being systematically robbed from Fort Concho with commandant Harry Morgan having no clue why . And Morgan's got other things on his mind as well . His daughter Elyssa Davalos is arriving to marry her fiancé , Lieutenant Robert Pine . But a most amorous private played by Tim Matheson keeps getting in the way . It was a stroke of genius at the Magic Kingdom when someone got the idea to team Don Knotts and Tim Conway . Like Bing Crosby and Bob Hope who had very successful careers as solos , when they teamed they really clicked . I only imagine that the individual projects both men were involved in kept them from doing even more films together . Each had a really good feel for the timing of the other and the comedy styles blended well . Disney Studios gave them a good cast in support as they always did . Ruth Buzzi has a nice turn as a blind lady who keeps trying to raise the town alarm about a bank robbery . But the absolute best was Kenneth Mars as Marshal Wooly Bill Hitchcock , a man who can't stand to lose . A feared legend of the west , he can't close the deal on Knotts and Conway , because strange fate keeps intervening . He gets driven to madness the same way Inspector Dreyfus is with Clousseau . Best scene in the film are Conway and Knotts as they bungle their way into burning the whole fort down , a bit taken from the Gary Cooper comedy , Cassanova Brown . Second best scene is Knotts and Conway in drag as saloon entertainers , taken of course from Some Like It Hot . Reused material or not , the stuff is very funny and more than kids will get laughs from two comic geniuses in The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
523,"Text1: For those who have had the immense pleasure of reading Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT not once but several times , basking in not only the brilliant story / mystery but also in the inordinately beautiful language , rest assured that the film not only does the book justice in the transference to the screen , but in the hands of screenplay writer Christopher Hampton ( we know that McEwan approved of the modifications as McEwan is one of the producers of the film ) becomes even more clear in its realization of the complex plot and finds the visual beauty inherent in McEwan's prose . Joe Wright as director steers this story well , finding just the right amount of back and forth nonlinear development that formed the magic of McEwan's initial weaving . The cast is uniformly superb . From the initial self-centered liar Briony Tallis ( an impressive Saoirse Ronan ) to the years ' later sorrowfully guilty young nurse Briony ( Romola Garai ) to the ' epilogue ' Briony of Vanessa Redgrave , the entire story is adroitly centered on this perpetrator of tragedy . But without the power of James McAvoy's falsely accused Robby Turner and Keira Knightley's tragic Cecilia Tallis the triad would not work . Even the smaller yet important roles assigned to Gina McGee , Brenda Blethyn , Jérémie Renier and countless others are played to perfection . The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey captures not only the misty tranquility of 1935 pre-war England complete with creative use of luminous light sources as well as the raw brutality of the battlefields as England enters WW II . Dario Marianelli's music score ( much of it played by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet ! ) incorporates the superb Sir Thomas Beecham recording of ' La Boheme ' with de los Angeles and Björling as incidental music to the typing of Robby's fateful note and then proceeds to incorporate the typewriter as if it were an instrument in his orchestrations . Rarely has this viewer been so moved by a film ( and perhaps that may have been related to just having heard a performance of Britten's WAR REQUIEM at the Los Angeles Philharmonic the previous night ! ) : it is the perfect marriage of novel , cinematic realization and commitment on the part of all concerned in the creation of this superlative film . Highly Recommended on every level . Grady Harp

Text2: SYNECDOCHE , NEW YORK is a firecracker display that sets the audience up for a grand epic of adventures then sputters its lovable way through over two hours of loosely connected views of life as we live it - through the eyes of an increasingly physically disabled director Caden Cotard ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) . Trying to summarize what the story is and does is always as risky task when it comes to Charlie Kaufman films and the audience for this work will be decidedly separated between the love it or hate it division . Kaufman manages to address so many issues ( marriage , adultery , joblessness , that thin thread of sanity that keeps actors committed to impossibly complex problematic productions , etc ) that keeping up with the nonlinear story line is challenging at best . But with a cast of characters as finely portrayed by actors such as Samantha Morton , Catherine Keener , Hope Davis , Michelle Williams , Jennifer Jason Leigh et al , the whole crazy film works wonders on the imagination . This is pure entertainment for the sake of entertainment and while Caden Cotard does represent Everyman searching for some semblance of meaning in a universe that makes little sense ( except that death is inevitable ! ) , it is the process more than the dialogue that makes this film such a pleasure to follow . Charlie Kaufman has done it again . . . . Grady Harp","{""output"": ""YES""}"

525,"Text1: Katherine Heigl probably captured the imagination of the many geeky boys out there when she gave Seth Logan's Ben Stone a one night stand in Judd Apatow's Knocked Up . It's a ridiculous premise some might add , but it propelled her to mass consciousness as the beautiful girl who would , and provided her an elevation of status she would recently decide to loathe . Anyway , all is forgiven , and she's back to grace our screens in a role that demonstrates you can attempt to dress her up in a sack , and even that would still make her look oh-so-sexy . Yes she's a clotheshorse , and Aline Brosh McKenna , whose earlier work was adapting The Devil Wears Prada for the screen , wrote a story filled with clothes and accessories that would do her no wrong , try as they might . This in fact is the draw of the movie , hitting out at the target audience just as Prada did with the many fashionable clothes , and this time , wedding gowns fit for a bridesmaid . Heigl plays a plain Jane , who discovers that her goal in life is to ensure that others celebrate their unforgettable wedding day with everything going like clockwork . She's the maid of honour , and organizes everything from early preparation like food tasting right down to actual day menial tasks , like holding the bride's gown while she's taking a pee . Like the trailer suggests , her perfect world is about to turn topsy turvy as the man of her dreams , her boss actually - George ( Edward Burns ) , get smitten with her sexy-kitten sister Tess ( Malin Akerman ) , thus allowing the green eyed monster to rear its ugly head , while at the same time , a mysterious lurker Kevin ( James Marsden ) becomes a perpetual irritation by trying very hard to crawl into her life . It's your classic recipe for a romantic comedy with love triangles , repressed feelings , and the most cliché of all , having the one you love standing right in front of you without you even knowing it . However , 27 Dresses played out like how the dresses themselves get quickly discarded into an overflowing cupboard . It has tons of potential in its material , but decide to bite off too much more than it can possibly chew . Like In Her Shoes , there was stuff of sibling rivalry ripe for the picking , but easily get glossed over in fleeting , unmemorable moments when the sisters go up against each other . And the love loss moments , while clearly there to milk emotions of the sentimental ones , did highlight a certain truth - that when we act on our impulses of negativeness , be it anger or envy and the likes , while we get our short term satisfaction when dishing out sweet revenge at that moment , more often than not we'll very soon find that we're flooded with feelings of regret and remorse , that actions when done , are spilt milk that cannot be cried over . I liked the beginning though , as it succinctly highlights the commercialization of the solemn marriage ceremony in modern times . These days , you can't tell one wedding moment apart from another , and don't get me started on those wedding dinners , where the same old formula gets repeated until they become stale , and you realize this starkness when you get invited to different weddings at the same venue , no doubt being packaged by the same offering . Such events are supposed to be unique and special , but they turn out like factory assembly lines . In my opinion , Katherine Heigl would probably be able to cement her leading lady status , and probably able to marquee movies on her own soon enough . Perhaps it would be refreshing if we could see her take on more diverse roles , if she breaks out of the rom-com genre . James Marsden continues his bad run of supporting roles , from Hairspray and Enchanted . Here , he combines elements from both , continuing his himbo status , and makes it three in a row in exhibiting his singing voice . Edward Burns plays the male bitch , taking over Meryl Streep in Prada , though there's a subtlety in the difference here that he doesn't show that he's an ass outwardly in an explicit manner , but rather seemed to be like the one in Singapore Dreaming . And Heigl is not only the one here making an impact though , as Malin Akerman herself probably , and hopefully not in a permanent manner , boxed herself as the new ditzy blonde ( remember The Heartbreak Kid ? ) , clearly taking over the mantle from Cameron Diaz . 27 Dresses is a movie that's meant to be a filler during a date , and one which doesn't shy away from trying hard to satisfy those who have come to pay tribute to woman's fashion . Especially when they're modelled by a statuesque beauty like Heigl . Come to think of it , while the gowns get their fair share of screen time , all 27 of them , the ones that stand out are the ordinary ones worn by Jane . And that's what 27 Dresses actually is . Ordinary , and saved by the beauty .

Text2: It begins with the murder of The Comedian ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan ) , a superhero once engaged by the government for its missions , and one of two which is sanctioned by the government . As part of the Minutemen , and then later the Watchmen group , we learn of The Comedian's backstory through a series of flashbacks with the members of his team , and we learn he isn't exactly the usual friendly neighbourhood type nor Mr Popular . He comes complete with plenty of skeletons in the closet , and with an extremely damaged persona made worse from the ghosts of war . He continues to do what he does because he can , which will make any human rights activist seethe with rage . Investigating the murder because he is certain that it leads to a bigger conspiracy of a hired killer engaged to bump off ex-superheroes , Rorschach ( Jackie Earle Haley ) takes it upon himself to work outside the system as an outlawed masked vigilante , and this narrative arc runs like an old-fashioned detective crime noir . Running around warning his ex-team members , we soon get introduced to all the other characters , like Dan Dreiberg the Night Owl II ( Patrick Wilson ) , Adrian Veidt's Ozymandias ( Matthew Goode ) , touted as one of the greatest brains and now turned into a successful businessman , who's in pursuit of renewable energy which he deems will turn back the doomsday clock because of his belief that man goes to war over finite resources , Silk Spectre II ( Malin Akerman ) whose mother was part of the Minutemen with The Comedian , and the only super-powered being Dr Manhattan ( Billy Crudup ) , whose allegiance with the USA staves off any potential pre-emptive aggression by the USSR . Quite a list of actors here and it's a smart move in casting a relatively none-too - A-list cast so that none would chew up the screen at the expense of another character or the plot . Snyder knows how to play up his strengths , since the movie's intelligence gets handed to him on a silver platter . What was once deem "" unfilmmable "" by directors who entered and left the project like through revolving doors , it's no surprise that the studios had turned to the man who faithfully adapted in visual terms , Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 . I suppose it's a bit of a no-brainer here to again try and visually adapt a graphic novel , and an Alan Moore masterpiece at that , by sticking true to its form from the comic panels . This of course would garner Snyder plenty of flak for doing what he does best again , leaving some unimpressed by reasoning it doesn't take a genius to do just that , but seriously , who has the balls to stamp their own mark on the story and characters , other than to put in some minor tweaks for the modern audience ? However Snyders shortcomings come in the form of the lengthy narratives found in the graphic novel , especially toward the second half of the film , and that between Dr Manhattan and Silk Spectre II , which he failed in bringing out the dramatic qualities in character realization and affirmation , and the only response to being like a deer caught in the headlights , Is to throw in more CG unfortunately . Action wise , the film medium allows for Snyder to connect the dots and interpret what happens between comic book panels . Granted the action sequences are few and far between , but Watchmen is never about superheroes busting balls . But when they do , it's no holds barred , and although the trailer seem to suggest plenty of slow-motion , the actual film is anything but . Some of the best set action pieces involve both Night Owl II and Silk Spectre II when they team up to reminisce the days of old . The action sequences here are well filmed , without those quick cut edits or too close a quarter that everything mixes together in a dizzy spin and you can't see anything . In a cinema hall with great sound system , you get to feel every whack and punch the character throws , with the bass reverberating right through to your heart . Now for the gripes . Unless you're really paying attention and can lip read , some of the dialogue may just fly past you so quickly , that you'll go "" huh ? "" . And that lengthy chit-chat that Dr . Manhattan has with the Silk Spectre II would test your patience a little , despite some graphical effects being overdone in attempting to distract you for a bit from the bore . I suppose that's one of the difficulties faced , in trying to summarize lengthy text from the book into a visual medium - how do you do so without putting your audience to sleep , and yet crucial enough to have to be included somehow ? I guess Snyder had yet to find that perfect balance there . Also , while it was a careful selection of songs from the 80s era for the soundtrack , Snyder shows he's no Tarantino in having a ear for great music , and some of the tunes did feel a little out of place . I did like the insertion of Simon and Garfunkel's Sounds of Silence though during a funeral scene . It worked perfectly and gave a very surreal feel to it all . Watch the Watchmen if you'd like a quick peek and introduction to the complexity and sheer genius of an Alan Moore story , coupled with visuals that pop right out of the graphic novel . With a little tweaks made to the story , purists may cry foul at such a blasphemous attempt . But if you take a look at the bigger picture , and the sacrifices for the objectives that can be achieved ( just like how it plays out in the story ) it just might win new fans over , and to pick up the source graphic novel . To that , I'd say this comes in recommended , though no thanks to additional edits made in order to cater to the teenage crowd here whom I suspect would be restless if approaching this film equating Snyder to 300 .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way you kill a ninja is with another ninja so he volunteers . This leads up to a big battle at the end as the dead ninja goes back into his body and they have it out in an all out war . Sounds better than it actually turned out being , but at least it was not boring .

Text2: I am a bit surprised to see this one ranked rather low here compared to other FF games , however , I thought it was great to revisit some of the characters I got to know from Final Fantasy X . An actual sequel this game features Yuna and Rikku along with a newcomer named Paine as sphere hunters . Granted Yuna is mainly doing this as a means to see if an old love is still alive . The format is different from X as it is more of a mission based and chapter based game . The story is still rather engaging , but combat is a bit tough this time around . Apparently , Rikku and Yuna have gotten vastly weaker since X . During the story you run into many old friends from ten and some new ones as there are different parties forming in the wake of the final destruction of Sin . So you have your intrigue plus quite a bit of comedy for your enjoyment as well . Still , this is not a true Final Fantasy game and it doesn't feel like one . . . the problem with going back to a world is you don't see all that much new stuff . There are not all that many new areas to explore much of it looks exactly the same so lets just say it does have a familiar ring to it . Still it is fun and the ending was good too .

Text2: The bloom is off the rose of the Stewart / Allyson partnership from "" The Stratton Story "" ( 1949 ) . They still have a nice screen rapport , but no are scenes as good as in their initial effort . Instead , the sad events in the Millers ' life seem to be accompanied by a cheerful tear and stiff upper lip ; for example , watch how they handle not having children . You definitely get a sense of the importance of the subject , musician Glenn Miller ; but , you also get a sneaking suspicion this is a VERY glossed over production . The dancers during one of Miller's most exciting numbers aren't even as excited as the elderly dancers on an old "" Lawrence Welk Show "" rerun . There are some serious editing / continuity distractions - worse , they are so obvious they spoil the important scene when Mrs . Miller and friends listen to the Christmas program .

A man's leg is graphically caught in a bear trap ; one is beheaded and another is hung from a tree and set on fire . This almost completely unknown Canadian slasher is one of the best low-budget horror films ever made . Often compared to "" Deliverance "" , it certainly has a similar theme . The film brilliantly conveys an atmosphere of total dread and fear , the feeling of losing control of the world around you . The climax is extremely eerie and haunting . There are some truly unsettling moments like the scene where one of the doctors is strung up , pleading for help whilst getting burned alive . "" Rituals "" features some striking shots such as the killer's lone silhouette watching from the horizon which elicit an ominous and almost unbearable sense of dread .

532,"Text1: Roger Ebert amongst others expressed their disappointment at THE BLACK WINDMILL on its release . Much of this disappointment is down to the director being Don Siegel who directed many famous thrillers including INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS , DIRTY HARRY and CHARLEY VARRICK . He is a director well suited to high concept American thrillers but there's something so very stiff upper lip and British about the mis-en - scene of THE BLACK WINDMILL . Someone's son gets kidnapped and his parents discuss it like one of their goldfish has died . You'd think such things as guilt and recriminations would feature heavily but apparently Brits are even less emotional than the pod people in INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS There's also a few very , very large plot holes throughout the movie one of the largest of which takes place in the opening sequence . Two young boys go to an airfield to fly their model plane . How earth did the villains know that the children would be appearing at that location ? Probably because if they didn't the film would have started in a completely different way or may not have started at all . When you've got a big name director it's interesting how many people pay no attention to the narrative

Text2: Michael Laemle ( Bryan Madorsky ) is an introverted child who's just moved to a new town with his parents . His parents are Nick ( Randy Quaid ) and Lily ( Mary Beth Hurt ) , two conformist types who are always eager to push leftover meat on him . Michael comes to wonder where the meat comes from , noting that all they ever seem to eat is leftovers . The revelation won't come as a surprise at all , but the fun of this movie is getting there . Marking the directorial debut of veteran actor Bob Balaban , it shows very striking visual treatment - there's a fine amount of surreal and disturbing sequences - and maintains a constant true sense of creeping unease throughout . It's as dark as a dark comedy can get , and does a marvelous job of putting a morbid spin on 1950's suburban Americana , and parenting in general as well . It's irreverent and grim and overall a real hoot . Balabans ' direction is great , and the acting is fine from the cast . Quaid is effectively restrained and he and Hurt make a good pair as the dubious parents . Madorsky offers a mature and low-key performance for a child actor , while Juno Mills-Cockell is appealing as his quirky , free-spirited new friend . Sandy Dennis also has a nice role as a concerned if a little kooky social worker . It's a refreshing and entertainingly sinister movie with a nice feel for the dark side that childhood can have . The whole idea of children wondering just how much or how little they know about their parents is explored for maximum shock value here , and the results are pretty effective .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
533,"Text1: The film gets credit for it's slow and deliberate pacing in the early going , as it builds suspense toward the revelation of the plot to destroy the Panama Canal . You had to wonder what all the intrigue and mystery was about regarding Clegg ( Paul Brinegar ) , Kroll ( John Mylong ) , Sam Wilton ( Leif Erickson ) and the film's title character Captain Trednor / Scarface ( Barton MacLane ) . It's not often you catch MacLane at the top of the credits , though he might have been upstaged in this one by Erickson as the hero of the piece . Still , he does a pretty good job when he's on screen , even if that German accent was somewhat distracting . The movie also did a nice job of explaining two key elements that might not have been offered in another film of the era where these kind of details weren't as important . For one , I was thinking about how the original Banos could have been blown up and disappeared without the authorities knowing , and that was handled competently by the Captain's explanation of Clegg's role to Wilton . Speaking of which , having Wilton's character portrayed as a former plantation foreman allowed for his proficiency with a machete . Too bad though about Mrs . Dilts , she seemed like a nice lady . That's not to say the picture didn't have it's share of outlandish elements . An atomic bomb on board a banana freighter ? - I don't think so . And how did Scarface manage to secure all the right scientific looking equipment on board the fake Banos without some knowledge of atomic bomb technology ? No need to get into that . Say , keep an eye on the handful of scenes starting with Wilton taking out the Captain up to breaking into the radio room with Crofton ; the sweat stains on his shirt and the bruise on his face change size and shape a number of times . Makes one wonder why those scenes weren't filmed one right after another . On balance though , I have no problem recommending this film for devotees of mystery and espionage , especially as a throwback to a time when Communist ideology threatened the very existence of the Western world - remember all those duck and cover drills in elementary school ? Ah yes , the 1950's , you had to be there .

534,"Text1: Werner Herzog , the filmmaker behind Fitzcarraldo that the director Les Blank is documenting ( in part ) with his Burden of Dreams , says that he has no interest in making a documentary about the Natives that are all around throughout the filming , who are apart of the cast as extras and also do labor . I wonder if Blank had intended to make his documentary with them as well , but here we have Burden of Dreams going between states of mind , of one mind-set being one of the most troubled and ambitious auteur projects of the past half century in film , and another mind-set being the people . In a sense , that line Dr . Lecter quotes from Marcus Aurelius in Silence of the Lambs comes to mind - what is it's nature ? In this case , the ' nature ' is of not just one specific thing but a few : what is the nature of the jungle ( or rather the nature of nature ) , the nature of a tribe of people who could see this film crew and this director with his insatiable visions as something quite alien , and vice-versa at times , and the nature of film-making in general , particularly a film that by the dictations of the script and the wills of its director demand to go for the impossible . It's almost no wonder at one point that Herzog says , "" I shouldn't make films anymore , I should be in a lunatic asylum . "" While not everything that could go wrong on a film goes wrong on Fitzcarraldo - the making of it I mean , not the film , of which I've yet to actually see myself - but it comes close . Along with Hearts of Darkness and Lost in La Mancha , Blank's film ranks as a contender for showing the most chaotic film production imaginable , but perhaps outdoes the others with Blank's purer skills as a documentarian . One might almost hope at times that Blank might editorialize , but there's none of that here . The narration as well just gives the facts as if reading out of a film magazine . And what's extraordinary though is that you don't need to see Fitzcarraldo to understand what the film's about through this one . The story is , as Herzog describes , about opera in the jungle , and how an obsessed opera fan ( played by Klaus Kinski ) decides to lug his ship over a mountain so he can build an opera in the jungle . Soon , however , Blank shows that this very act becomes an even more daunting task / metaphor than Herzog might have intended , but never do we see him decide to just give up . "" I live my life or I end my life with this picture , "" Herzog says . It would be one thing if Blank just looked at the film-making process from start to finish with Fitzcarraldo , and I imagine Blank probably had enough footage to make for an even longer film just covering the odds & ends of filming . But we as the viewer soon come to realize that to make Fitzcarraldo requires an understanding of the people behind it , not just the main man behind it , but of the tribe . It's interesting to note that the natives Herzog uses the first time around show one side of the ' nature ' of what comes in filming in foreign territory : they attack the film crew , forcing Herzog to find a new location . This first major set-back is only covered briefly early on in the film , but it fascinated me how Herzog still remained undeterred , even though it ended up taking him another year to settle on the final locations . Then Blank turns his camera on the natives lending their support ( for more money than they usually get with the usual labor they work for ) , and it's done sometimes with the same care of getting great glimpses of the culture , of what habits and customs are with them ( like the alcohol / fruit that's a given for them ) , and how the tensions start to rise as the film backs up . Blank's camera is terrifically poised in these moments , and he ends up also getting a fine comparison between the film crew itself . Only Kinski , who I would think would be the only person more of interest , is usually left out , which is disappointing . But the real excitement is seeing the daily struggles of filming , and how the boat-over-the-mountain metaphor becomes apart of this struggle , be it something small like getting a rubber-skewer right ( which is very funny ) , or in getting that toughest of shots at the "" magic hour "" of the dusk . And the problems keep mounting , until what we see is a filmmaker almost too reckless for his own good , yet perhaps for his own sanity as well . I can't imagine what might have happened to Werner Herzog had he not taken that final shot , or if he had , like Coppola to an extent with Apocalypse Now , sort of succumbed to the jungle's dangers like a Conrad character . What we end up seeing of Herzog is perhaps a man under the duress and total stress of film-making - or total control , who can say - but even when he's at his bleakest statements , it's never boring or pretentious to hear what Herzog has to say about the jungle or the people or to see how he directs . And around Herzog , and that giant boat , and the natives and the jungle , Blank creates the kind of behind-the-scenes documentary unique , where psychology and anthropology get brilliant put into the context of ' filming dreams ' , as it were .

The two of them fall in love which leads to numerous problems . I've never liked David Leans films . They LOOK great but the stories are almost impossible to follow . Like in "" Dr .

Not quite one of those movies that are just one random sex scene after the other this one interjects a bit of story in it to progress from one scene to the next .

The story which is not exactly a work of art , but moves rather well a researcher is trying to make a sex robot or something to that effect . I could not tell if it was supposed to be a robot or some sort of artificial life or something . I mean this is a porno so not much money is going to be spent .

540,"Text1: The title of this magnificent documentary is ambiguous enough to suggest the director was getting to know this family , or the actual incarceration of Arnold and Jesse Friedman . Andrew Jarecki accomplishes a deeply disturbing portrait of a family in turmoil in the suburbs , where everything is supposed to be ideal and things like this never happen . Arnold Friedman was a sick man . He was a homosexual and a pedophile , who took refuge in the form of a normal father and husband in Great Neck . In almost all cases such as this , the pedophile has been a victim himself at an earlier age . The way he translated his desires was by molesting other children that might be in the wrong place at the wrong time . Arnold must have been sexually abused by the some of the men his mother took to bed , and he in turn , made his own brother Howard have improper sex with him . In abusing his own son , Jesse , Arnold proves that his appetite doesn't differentiate between his own flesh and blood from a stranger . Jesse must have loved the attention his father always showed him and went along with the sickening arrangement to keep his father happy . Jesse in turn will probably go into being a pedophile himself because deep inside of him will be a desire to do unto others what was done to him when he couldn't fight back . Elaine , the mother , is a pathetic figure in this household . She had no clue of what was going on under her roof . She turned perhaps a blind eye toward what her husband was doing under her nose because there must have been indications that Jesse's relationship with his father was not normal . Jesse , as a child , had such a tender beauty that it's not difficult to see the way he awakened a sickening desire in his own father . As far as the case is concerned , it all came about because of the Postal inquiry about the pornography that Arnold bought as a way to satisfy his cravings . Since he was heavily into taking home movies , it will surprise no one that he had access to a lot of young boys that were his children's playmates and ultimately his own students of computer science at the very beginning of the technology . All the Friedmans , with the exception of Seth , who doesn't appear in the documentary , express their opinions as commentators ; they all cooperated willingly , or so it seems , with the director . We wonder to what extent Elaine keeps denying her knowledge , or David , for that matter because it's obvious that Jesse is not one to ask because all what he went through is very painful , or he would not be objective about this case . Even Howard , Arnold's own brother can't understand what was going on in his brother's house . He talks to the camera and seems absolutely normal about telling this story . Toward the end of the documentary , his male lover gives his own account and frankly , it surprises the viewer , because we had no indication at all that Howard was gay and living with in a seeming healthy relationship . The young people that were made to accuse the Friedmans fall under two categories , either they were speaking the truth , or they were made to confess things that didn't happen to them . There have been a lot of instances with smaller children , where the police and criminal investigators have put into their minds things that they think occurred , thus making these young ones to react as though it was indeed what they experienced in the hands of pedophiles . Jesse is taken to prison as well as Arnold because they are accused by the former students of having acted improperly . There is a revealing sequence in an interview with the lawyer that defended the Friedmans . It's seen toward the end of the film . In it , the lawyer speaks about the time he visited Arnold in prison and how nearby there was a man who was holding a young boy in his lap . As the child was getting restless , he kept jumping up and down and that action kept turning Arnold on sexually , that he asks the lawyer to move to another area . It is at this point that we get an insight into Arnold's perverse and uncontrollable sick mind and what aroused him . By way of atoning , or perhaps in a last effort to ask forgiveness from Jesse , Arnold takes a life insurance policy that makes his youngest son the beneficiary , but nothing else goes to the family , or at least , it's never explained in the film . This is one of the most disturbing documentaries that have come out in a long time . Thanks should go to the director Andrew Jarecki for delving into the tragic story of the Friedman family .

Text2: ' Moonlight ' is ( so far ) the only movie I've ever seen that was shot in Luxembourg , but I fervently hope it's not a typical example of Luxembourgeoise cinema . This movie is a lot more arty-tarty than it needs to be . For starters , the title is nearly irrelevant : some of the action takes place in a house named Mondschein ( ' moonlight ' ) , but that name is completely arbitrary and unrelated to the plot . SPOILERS COMING . ' Moonlight ' is the first movie I've seen that's directed by Paula van der Oest , and ( again ) I fervently hope this is not a typical example of her craft . In ' Moonlight ' , she shows a penchant for camera set-ups that are distracting and serve no useful purpose . When young Claire feeds her dog , van der Oest plumps for an overhead shot as if we were watching a Busby Berkeley musical . Later , Claire and the fugitive boy break into a house during the resident family's absence , and then attempt some sexual fumblings in the parents ' bed . . . only to be caught in the act when two people walk in . Van der Oest uses a very contrived camera set-up to make us think that the arrivals are the parents , then uses a reverse angle to reveal that they are actually the family's son and daughter . The switcheroo serves absolutely no purpose except to disorient us . Elsewhere , Claire tells the boy that she's a foundling : is this true , or is it a lie told in a childish attempt to impress him ? We never find out . Either way , it's irrelevant to the story . ' Moonlight ' could have been a straightforward thriller . A boy from an unnamed country ( apparently Turkey ) has arrived in Luxembourg as a drugs ' mule ' , his digestive tract packed with condoms filled with narcotic contraband . When he fails to excrete them quickly enough , a drugs runner shoots him and leaves him for dead . . . but stupidly doesn't bother to check . The girl Claire finds the boy and helps him , but oddly she never tells her parents about him . ( If she's a foundling , they must be her foster parents . ) Very implausibly , she runs away from home with the boy , having no clear destination in mind . Are there no police in Luxembourg ? The film places some emphasis on pubescent sexuality : Claire experiences her menarche just before she finds the bleeding boy , and there's some attempt to equate her bloodstained knickers with his bloodstained gut . Later , there's a deeply implausible sequence in which the two runaways enrol themselves in a girls ' convent school , where the nuns accept them without question . Claire introduces the boy as her sister : he is very clearly male ( even while wearing a Communion dress ) , yet all the nuns and at least one priest automatically accept him as a girl . Speaking of girls ' clothing , I could have done without the shot of the Down's Syndrome girl stripping off to her bra and underpants . Obscure joke : Claire's dog is named Quick , and at one point the dog seems to have a stunt double . I couldn't help wondering if the stunt double's name is Flupke . ( Americans won't get this reference . ) This is one of those movies in which increasingly contrived events keep happening . . . and AFTER each one occurs , we realise that it didn't really happen after all : Claire seems to be turning more and more hallucinatory as the film proceeds . At the end of the film , Claire commits suicide by an extremely implausible method . Or . . . DOES she ? Sheesh ! I well and truly wanted to like this film . When director van der Oest puts aside her arty crotchets and she sticks to the story , she shows some genuine narrative talent despite the increasing incoherence of this plot line . In the lead role as Claire , young actress Laurien Van den Broeck is extremely pretty and personable , with significant screen presence . I wish her good luck elsewhere in other projects . If you watch any five consecutive minutes of ' Moonlight ' , you'll mistake this for a brilliant film . If you watch it from beginning to end , as I did , your response will likely be similar to mine : namely , "" HUH ? "" I wish that all this talent and these resources had been devoted to a more coherent screenplay , and I regretfully rate ' Moonlight ' only .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
541,"Text1: The brilliant creators of "" Airplane "" bring us back to the non-stop slap stick comedy of "" Scary Movie 3 "" . In my opinion , this is my favorite Scary Movie out of the three so far , this was just too much for words to say how funny it was . I never had such a good time in the theater , I even saw it 3 times because I just couldn't get enough laughs . The movies are now : Signs , 8 Mile , The Others , The Ring , and The Matrix movies . We have two old friends , Anna Farris back as Cindy and Regina Hall back as Brenda . We have a new and more fun cast with Leislie Neilson , Charlie Sheen , Denese Richards , Simon Rex , and the two that stole the movie Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart . Together they brought together a movie that would not stop with the great comedy . Despite it being a very short movie , it makes you just want to watch it again and again . I'm not sure which was my favorite parody , I think it was either the rap battle where Simon plays George as Eminem in 8 Mile and they had that great cameo of Simon from American Idol . Of course , I enjoyed the Michael Jackson joke , I just was dying of that line "" How do you like it , huh ? "" representing Michael dangling his baby in Berlin earlier this year and now Charlie Sheen gets the chance to give Michael his own medicine . Every scene is a great one , trust me , this is by far the best Scary Movie . You'll have a great time .

Text2: A little known fact about me is that I'm a big fan of fluffy romantic comedies . Why wouldn't you want to spend 90 minutes or so watching a film ; laughing and ultimately feeling good at the end of it ? I don't consider fluffy romance films to be at the absolute top of cinema , but they're good fun , and therefore get a thumbs up from me . The Wedding Singer , however , gets not one thumb up ; but both thumbs , firmly , up . So , why does The Wedding Singer succeed more than most films in it's sub genre ? Is it the jokes ? The beautiful female lead ? The gratuitous helping of 80's pop songs ? No , it's that this movie has a lot of heart ; that's what makes it a winner . Adam Sandler stars as the quintessential ' loser ' . He's a wedding singer , and not a very good one either . He specialises in doing terrible covers of 80's songs . It's not the sort of act that I would want at my wedding . His life gets worse one day , his wedding day , to be exact , when someone doesn't turn up . The bride , that is . Now in a deep spiral of depression , our hero doesn't see any way forward . His next gig is a washout and there's love all around him ; even his newfound friend , the cute little waitress that works at the same place as him is getting married . And to a man who doesn't deserve her , I might add . I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next , but even though it's a predictable ride ; trust me , it's a ride you want to be on . Adam Sandler tends to be a very annoying actor ; and for that reason he is almost universally disliked , but it is undeniable that he is good in this movie . Nobody else could have given the character what Sandler gave him ; his performance is both entertaining and believable , and therefore is just right for the movie . Drew Barrymore was also perfectly cast . She is the perfect girl in this movie ; all smiles and sunshine , and it's impossible not to fall in love with her . The movie also features great little turn from Steve Buscemi , who provides the film with one of it's funniest moments towards the start . As mentioned ; The Wedding Singer has a lot of heart . From the way that the characters interact with each other , particularly Sandler and Barrymore , it is obvious that they are in love . The movie also has some points to make on the subject of love ; The Wedding Singer portrays that being in love is overall better than being a ' Fonz ' type , womanising character . The message at the movie's centre is also a worthwhile one ; the movie professes that it isn't important who you fall in love with ; it doesn't matter whether or not he's merely a wedding singer , all that matters is the love between two people . The movie says that love is all you need ; and that is a worthwhile message in any movie . The movie's message is lost somewhat under the barrage of jokes ; but it's most certainly there and I for one think that it's a shame that a movie that is entertaining and funny can't be considered in the same league as other , more serious movies with a similar message . Overall , The Wedding Singer is at the very top of the romantic comedy genre . It will make you laugh , and you will ultimately feel for the characters . The fact that this movie has something to say is only another reason to recommend it ; especially as it says it with a great big smile on it's face . The Wedding Singer is not a film that you will want to miss ; it's feel-good at it's best .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
542,"Text1: Marilyn Monroe , Don Murray , Arthur O'Connell and Betty Field are all at the "" Bus Stop , "" a 1956 film based on the play by William Inge and directed by Josh Logan . Murray plays a young , ill-mannered , uninhibited cowboy who's never been off the ranch , who comes to town to appear in a rodeo . When he sees Cherie ( Monroe ) performing at a club , he decides then and there to marry her - and he's so determined , he kidnaps her to get her to return to Montana with him . They're snowed in , however , and have to stop for the night at a restaurant on the route , run by Betty Field . Logan seems to have directed this like a play , and Murray's performance through most of the film is very stagy - big and loud . Bo's character was written for the stage ; I'm not certain in any hands it would have translated with ease to film . Today it seems overdone . Marilyn Monroe is fantastic as Cherie , a role done on Broadway by Kim Stanley . She uses a very broad accent - but what she lacks in technique she makes up in charm , beauty and warmth . She creates a wonderful , vulnerable character here that the audience cares about . The other standout is Betty Field , who does an excellent job as the owner of the restaurant who has a little flirtation going with the bus driver . Hope Lange has a small part as a waitress ; I assume this is where she met her husband , Don Murray . Arthur O'Connell is terrific as Bo's friend who tries to keep him in line . A really good film with a strong cast and a very iconic role for Monroe .

Text2:  The Day the Earth Stood Still  is a timely , fun science fiction film from 1951 directed by Robert Wise . It has a great cast : Michael Rennie , Patricia Neal , Hugh Marlowe , Billy Gray , Sam Jaffe , Lock Martin , and Frances Bavier . It concerns the aliens Klaatu and Gort ( a 7'7 "" actor discovered working as a doorman at Graumann's Chinese Theater ) who come to earth to talk to world leaders about their acquisition of atomic power and what it may mean to other planets . Klaatu is met with violence and distrust , but eludes his captors . He is helped by a woman ( Patricia Neal ) and her young son ( Billy Gray ) who live in the rooming house where Klaatu is hiding under the name of Mr . Carpenter . This classic movie has few special effects - certainly nothing like we would see today . It's a very simple story told in a straightforward way , but it remains timely as countries perceived as our enemies acquire not atomic power but nuclear power . Klaatu wants the world to live in peace and respect . Though it hasn't happened and probably isn't going to , it's still a worthwhile goal and is why the film remains on favorite lists .

Text2: Edge-of-your-seat drama based on two non-fiction books by Robert Graysmith about the Zodiac killer . The ruthless serial killer haunted and terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the 60's and 70's ; leaving citizens and police authorities in a constant state of panic and shock . The killer would mock detectives and news reporters by leaving a series of ciphers and menacing letters with the promise of his identity . The trails of evidence yielded false leads .

Text2: A young accomplished headmistress of a Parisian village , Miss Helen ( Stéphane Audran ) , is in a conundrum . . she's in love with a serial killer , Paul ( Jean Yanne ) , the local butcher , who has been stabbing young females in the surrounding area with a knife , leaving bloody corpses . Stumped Police Inspector Grumbach ( Roger Rudel ) questions Helen after a second murder of a local girl married to a teacher she knows , Leon ( Mario Beccara ) , bleeds upon the head of a student after a field trip into a cavern looking at prehistoric paintings . Helen confiscates a key piece of evidence linking Paul to the crime . . a cigarette lighter she gave him for his birthday . What started as a blossoming romance between two people soon darkens as Helen must fear that Paul's homicidal tendencies could endanger her own well being . My first Claude Chabrol thriller was a nice surprise . It's really more of a character study , a kind of "" opposites attract "" romance develops regarding how two completely different people find a mutual growing friendship and love for one another despite their glaring differences . Audran is a revelation , completely believable , as this elegant , refined , sophisticated lady who is absolutely realistic as the headmistress . Yanne looks like your typical working-class butcher , walking with a slouch , often discussing the horrors of war , but very mannered , guarded as to not say too much , yet appealing in a quiet way . I like how they find this pleasant rapport with each other . I think the decision to shoot in such a minimalist manner , from the performances to the style , enhances the film . . like a good Hitchcock thriller , Chabrol is even able to create a type of McGuffen regarding the first murder as we follow Helen and Paul's bonding , the way they meet each other ( . . stopping by each other's place of employment as they work ) , spending time together , disregarding the village uproar about the vicious slaying , acknowledging it in a subdued way . I think that's perhaps the most interesting aspect of the thriller . . the way neither Helen or Paul dwell on the murder until they have no other choice . For a while the only way you could tell it was a potential thriller was the very moody , rather chilling score . I think another aspect which worked for me was the idea that a killer was close by and that Helen was the main focus of the film . . Chabrol never leaves her , and the threat towards her life was quite vivid . I appreciate Chabrol's unpretentious direction . . he doesn't call attention to himself , allowing the characters and story to grip you instead .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: What a movie . Martin Sheen is an anguished Army captain in Vietnam in 1968 , ordered to proceed up river to the Cambodian border on a Navy River Patrol Boat and assassinate a Colonel Kurtz ( Marlon Brando ) who has apparently gone berserk and established his own little , ruthless anti-communist empire in the jungle . It's a free transposition of Joseph Conrad's "" Heart of Darkness "" but that hardly matters . Nor does the overall plot . We already know most of it because some of its features have become integral to our vernacular culture . "" I love the smell of napalm in the morning . It smells like - - victory . "" "" The horror . The horror . "" ( Well - - that last is lifted directly from Conrad's novel , but never mind . ) What Stephen Spielberg did so miraculously with light in "" Close Encounters of the Third Kind , "" Francis Ford Coppola does with smoke here . All kinds of smoke . Gray smoke from gunfire and explosions . Amber smoke from fires . Pink and lime and lavender smoke from flares and grenades . People stalk slowly through it like images from hell . Boats drift through clouds of it . The lighting ( Vittorio Storaro ) and special effects contribute to the impact of the film too . Brando's first appearance in unforgettable chiaroscuro . A burnt orange light illuminates his shaved head from the side and turns the naked scalp into a luminous crescent . Then Brando bows his head , dips his fingers into a bowl of water and flutters his fingertips along the skin as if playing a piano or celesta . Sheen's boat and its two-man crew glide very slowly into the tiny cove which serves as Brando's main port . The place looks like mannequin factory . There are bodies and body parts strewn about . Bodies that are more or less whole droop from the trees and from the gargoyle monuments that surround the entrance to Brando's dark and beckoning castle . Hundreds of half-naked natives with spears and guns have assembled in silence to greet the boat . Out of this unholy horde dances a crazed photographic journalist , the ever reliably crazed Dennis Hopper . He shouts greetings , shakes hands , welcomes them warmly , but adds in a wary tone , "" They think you've come to kill him - - and I hope THAT'S not true . "" He leads the stunned Sheen through the throng that opens before them . Sheen is gaping at some of the body parts . "" The heads - - you're lookin ' at the heads ! Y'know , sometimes he goes too far , but he'll be the first to admit it , man . "" Brando is a warrior and a poet . He's a philosopher . "" Did you ever think that the middle word of LIFE is IF ? "" That whole climactic visit to Brando's fortress in the wilderness lifts the movie out of whatever sense of reality it had earlier carried and places it squarely into the surreal . It's just impossible . A viewer can't tell what consequences any given event will precipitate . There are two beheadings and a buffalo having its head half chopped off by the Bontoc Igorots among whom this film was shot . ( Only three generations ago , they hunted heads . I was in graduate school with an Igorot whose grandfather had enjoyed such an enterprise . ) It's about as arty a film as you're likely to see , if art means slowly and relentlessly digging beneath the civilized surface of human culture and uncovering the uncoverable nature of humanity itself , and that's not a pretty picture .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Michael E . Uslan briefly sums up what each of the four films are like , which era of Batman comics , which is quite interesting . It is pointed out that Joel saw it very much as a comic , which helps explain ( also mentioned is the fact that he doesn't like it too serious ) . And he himself actually apologizes ( well , perhaps only to the people who loved Batman Forever , but were disappointed by Batman & Robin ) , which helps , I guess . John Glover doesn't say terribly much , but it isn't bad , and one of the things is somewhat amusing ( if really obvious ) . O'Donnell comes across as much smarter and grown-up than in the other special features on the DVD ( the 2-Disc Special Edition release of Batman & Robin ) . The approach to the film is described , and any fan will be able to tell right away where they went wrong ( heck , if you have a basic concept of what Batman is , as a character , you can ) .

Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows - - that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths . They also reckon that maybe she's turning into a cobra , which is the case . Dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point . By this time Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled , particularly Thompson , who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him , too , although he must explain to her what "" love "" is . No matter . A final reckless attack by the cobra woman against Long's girl friend - - not one of the six original offenders - - and Thompson must throw the snake out the window . On the pavement below , the body changes to that of Domergue . The end . I think I'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises . I'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing . Who paid for Domergue's fare from somewhere in Asia to New York ? Who's paying her utility bills in the hotel ? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe ? How come she speaks American English so well ? What the hell's going on ? The writers and director have clearly seen some of Val Lewton's modest horror films and , though not much effort has gone into this production , they've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from Lewton . In Lewton's "" The Cat People "" , for instance , the woman is transformed into a black leopard but , with one tiny exception , the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it . Most of the transformations here use shadows too , but unlike Lewton's , the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous . Lewton also made occasional use of what he called "" buses "" . Lewton's first "" bus "" was a literal one . A potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps . Something or someone is following her . She freezes with fright under a street lamp . Something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her . She looks upward . There is a loud , wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end . It's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her . The producers used at least two "" buses "" in this film and they amount to nothing . A guy is walking distractedly across an intersection , for instance , and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him . There is no set up to the shot . It's jammed in with a shoe horn . I don't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy , ugly , venomous , and phallic . As a matter of fact , no snakes are slimy , most are harmless , and many are extraordinarily beautiful . Furthermore , they're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals . You want a reptilian symbol for masculinity ? Try a six-lined racerunner . It's a really fast lizard . When it sees something to eat , it rushes up and gobbles it down . Anyway , if you want to see some fine , low-budget scary films , don't bother with this one . Find "" The Cat People "" or one of Lewton's other minor masterpieces , of which this is an obvious copy .

Text2: What could be an interesting story about a madman and the police in pursuit of him is turned into a soap-opera tragedy of the week punctuated by a few anonymous shots fired from a pistol in close up . We learn an awful lot about Detective Ed Zigo's tribulations , mainly centering about his wife's terminal illness , and very little about the key figure in the story . David Berkowitz was a paranoid schizophrenic who worked for the post office and obeyed orders given to him by a neighborhood dog , which he called "" Sam . "" He led the police and the press a merry chase . The newspapers and TV reporters of the time were going berserk with speculation . He was an ex-policeman because he used the two-handed combat crouch that cops used . ( All he had to do to learn that stance was go to a movie . ) He was on the lookout for girls with long brown hair parted in the middle because of some buried trauma . ( Every young woman in the United States of America had long brown hair parted in the middle . ) He was an artist or an architect because of the fussily neat printing he used in his letters to journalists . ( He was nothing of the sort , just a guy with neat printing . ) He had some kind of cowboy complex because he used a . 44 caliber weapon . ( It was just convenient , he had other weapons too . ) He turned out to be , not David Berkowitz , but rather "" David Berkowitz , "" an adopted child with an Italian background . ( All my Jewish friends breathed a sigh of relief . ) Whatever his background he was nutty as a fruitcake . A hole in his apartment wall had a cartoon balloon over it , saying , "" Hi . My name is Mr . Williams and I live in this hole . "" The fact that a guy so flagrantly nuts could work in an ordinary post office without detection is almost as scary as the fact that he could stalk the streets at night . The story was filled with ironies . The ol ' . 44 he toted was built by Charter Arms . It's a large-caliber gun . Yet , despite firing at very close range , he only managed to kill six of his 13 victims with it . Was it possible that Charter Arms ' . 44 pistol wasn't really as lethal as everyone had thought ? A spokesman for the firm was more or less forced , in effect , to defend the product and apologize for the fact that most of the victims survived . None of this is in the film . Not that the acting is poor . Martin Sheen is quite good , as usual , especially hustling across the street to inform his partners that he has just discovered the shooter's identity after searching his car , practically dancing with excitement . But the people making this film didn't seem to know what they were aiming for . The first several shootings take place without elaboration or explanation before we meet any of the characters . The procedures involved in tracking Son of Sam down are skipped over , as if they were interruptions of the tragic drama of Zigo's life , the main subject of the movie . James Edward Olmos , a first-rate actor , is given a surfeit of screen time at the expense of the detective story . There are extended family scenes that deserve no more than footnotes . All of this detracts from the impact and suspense of a sensational story , even from our interest in it . Where did the director and the writers think they were going with this ? Into Plan A , The disease of the week protocol ? If you want to learn about the case , read one of the several books available about it , including a novelized version by Jimmy Breslin . Don't waste time on this misguided effort .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
550,"Text1: Evil Never Dies starts as evil neck breaking serial killer William Charles Lee ( Simon Bossell ) murders Abby Ryan ( Zoe Naylor ) the wife of Detective Mark Ryan ( Thomas Gibson ) who is currently trying to bring him to justice , Mark runs after William & manages to capture him & just about keep himself from killing him . Jump forward a few years & Willaim Charles Lee is executed in the gas chamber & Detective Ryan has been transfered to act as a liaison officer at a local college after several violent incidents , he teams up with campus security guard Chris Thompson ( Christopher Morris ) who is a bit gung-ho in his attitude . One night while watching the old science building Chris notices genetic scientist Professor Arkin ( John Waters ) & his pretty assistant Eve ( Katherine Heigl ) enter it without permission , he call Ryan who finds out that they were conducting experiments on the re-animation of dead cells , their test subject was the serial killer Willaim Charles Lee & the experiments prove more successful than they could have imagined . . . Co-produced & directed by Uli Edel this made-for-TV effort seems to have a pretty bad reputation but I have to admit I quite liked it , I wasn't expecting anything from the film so maybe that helped raise my affinity for it but I honestly didn't think it was too bad at all . The script by Max Enscoe , Annie de Young , Farhad Mann & Barry Sandler ( it took four people to write this ? ) takes itself very seriously & even though it sounds like a straight Frankenstein type horror film it's more of a thriller drama as the only real horror element is the bringing back to life of William Charles Lee the serial killer because after that it completely ignores the genetic experiment angle of the film & actually kills Professor Arkin off & never mentions it again . Evil Never Dies then concentrates on Ryan tracking down William & trying to convince his superiors & friends that he is still alive killing people which he gets blamed for who predictably don't believe him . Another reason why I quite liked this is because of the neat twist ending which I didn't see coming , I thought it was going to be pretty routine & predictable all the way but the ending was a bit of a nice surprise . It moves along at a reasonable pace , there's just about enough going on to stop you from falling asleep , the character's & dialogue are serviceable & I thought it was a decent little film that exceeded my very low expectations . Director Udel does OK & considering the low TV budget this looks alright , there's not much style but it's watchable if nothing else . I would have liked a bit more horror in it & forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any , William Charles Lee is a serial killer who breaks necks so unfortunately there's no need for any expensive gory special effects . I wouldn't say it's particularly scary either , sorry . Technically it's fine , it's well made & has reasonable production values . This was actually filmed in Melbourne in Australia although you won't really notice as it looks just like any American city . The acting is OK & it's always nice to see total babe Katherine Heigl in something , Australian Simon Bossell who plays the serial killer here will probably be better known to millions of viewers throughout the world as Alan Fisher from the Australian soap Home and Away in which he appeared in nearly 300 episodes . Evil Never Dies is never going to make anyone's top 10 best films list but I certainly don't think it deserves all the hate it has on the IMDb , it's nothing overly special sure but I still thought it was alright & it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be .

Text2: For those of you who only know Shirley Booth from the television series Hazel , I would strongly recommend you look at the list of her Broadway credits which date all the way back to the twenties . She appeared in so many Broadway plays that later went on screen without her recreating the role . For example she created parts in The Philadelphia Story , Goodbye My Fancy , and Desk Set that were later played by Ruth Hussey , Joan Crawford and Katharine Hepburn respectively . Booth joined that select group of players who won both Tony and Oscars for playing the same role in Come Back , Little Sheba . The play by William Inge ran for 190 performances during the 1950 season and co-starred Sidney Blackmer with Booth . Like the Lunts when they filmed The Guardsman , we get to see but one of her performances preserved on film , maybe her best role . William Inge's play concerns two very ordinary people , Doc and Marie Delaney , a seemingly quiet middle aged couple . But like George and Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf , there's a lot of skeletons in the Delaney closet . Doc was forced to marry Marie when she became pregnant and then the baby was lost anyway . Both made the best of the situation . Doc , unfortunately turned to drink . But when we meet him he's been sober for a year and involved with Alcoholics Anonymous . Marie is this dowdy middle aged housewife who's forever tuned into the radio and constantly reminiscing of her youth . Doc is just the opposite , he doesn't like to talk at all about the past . But he gets a bit of nostalgia going when pretty and stacked Terry Moore boards with the Delaneys . Her presence in the house sets of a chain of events that knocks Doc off the wagon . We then see what Marie's been living with before AA . Another reviewer remarked at how well Shirley Booth caught the attitudes and mannerisms of the wife of an alcoholic and where had she done her research for the part . The answer is she lived it . Her first husband , Ed Gardner from radio's Duffy's Tavern , was a notorious alcoholic , Booth got all the material she ever would need to create Marie Delaney with him . For movie box office Burt Lancaster played Doc Delaney and he got rave notices himself for the part . Doc was such a change from the aggressively masculine heroes like Lancaster played in The Crimson Pirate or The Flame and the Arrow . I wouldn't doubt that his performance may have led to Lancaster being cast in From Here to Eternity and winning his first Oscar nomination . In a sense Lancaster plays two roles because the sober Doc is a totally different individual from the raging drunk when he gives in to temptation . The title comes from their dog Sheba who up and ran away one day . Marie calls for him constantly , thinks she sees him at times . But Sheba's a metaphor for their youth which is never to return . Cinema acting don't get much better than Burt Lancaster and Shirley Booth in Come Back , Little Sheba .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
551,"Text1: This early 70's British thriller is presented by a famous director ( Don Siegel of "" Invasion of the Body Snatchers "" and "" Dirty Harry "" ) and stars a couple of very prominent and contemporary popular male names like Michael Caine , Donald Pleasence and John Vernon . Yet it somehow ended up in total oblivion and it has not been released on DVD so far . Perhaps this can partly be explained because it's a very slow and largely action-free movie that came out in era dominated by rough and extravagant exploitation efforts . Still , if you're a fan of espionage or political thrillers in general , you might want to look for "" the Black Windmill "" after all , since it definitely contains some redeeming elements . Although completely implausible , the story is fairly compelling with some inventive plot twists and ? most notably ? some excellent examples of dry British humor . Caine plays an agent working for the country's secret service , a job that already cost him his marriage . When his 7-year-old son gets kidnapped and the culprits demand an extremely high ransom to be paid in diamonds , John Tarrant starts the rescue mission on his own . While his supervisors still wonder about where the leak in their organization comes from , Tarrant steals the diamonds himself and heads for France to meet the kidnappers . Nothing spectacular happens for a long , long time and it's only Donald Pleasence's ( and others ) wit remarks that keep you mildly interested in the film . The entire middle-section is painfully boring and , although the ending makes up for much , it can't possibly be called a classic . Oh , and don't start looking for the mysterious titular black windmill right away , as this uncanny building is just a tiny aspect in the story and not even that relevant . Not trying to spoil things here , just advising the people that are , like me , attracted by the ominous windmill on the box cover not to expect too much .

Text2: Phantasm and its sequels is a popular horror-series , but not as big as the obvious franchises such as Nightmare on Elm street , Halloween or Friday the 13th . And that's a good thing because you can't really compare this ingenious muddle with mainstream slashers . Phantasm is a complete one-man Don Coscarelli project with a good share of morbidity , humor and extravagance ? all brought together in one major cool looking packing . The plot simply has to be to be believed . The Tall Man ( terrific charismatic performance by Agnus Schrimm ) is some sort of nightmarish grave robber . Immensely strong and ghoulish as he turns corpses into ugly little dwarfs , before shipping them out as intergalactic slaves ! How does this rate on your originality scale ? ! ? Phantasm contains other ( already legendary ) elements such as the deadly flying spheres that plant themselves into the victim's forehead and then perpetrates the brain . A pretty violent thing to see , but even more appealing when you're a horror fan . Regretfully , Phantasm also suffers from a few overwhelming negative aspects . Like the uninteresting main characters of the boy and his older brother . The stress isn't laid on The Tall Man in this first episode yet , and the ultra-cool Reggie ( an ice-cream vending guitar player with a ponytail ) hasn't got that much screen time , neither . The finale is a big letdown and a bit too confusing for a late 70's horror film . So far , 4 sequels have been produced . The first one ( released in 1988 ) is a highly recommended film with an overload of macabre splattering and black humor . At times , this first sequel was even funnier to look at than the original . All the other sequels can easily be skipped .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

554,"Text1: What a great show in the middle of the 20th century ! Not only did Gertrude Berg star , but she also wrote the material for the show . She was a wonderful actress and her sudden passing , just before Rosh Hashanah , in 1966 , was a terrible shock to all . The show depicted a typical Jewish family living in the Bronx in the 1950s . Molly may have been harried but she was always on the ball . "" Yoo hoo , Mrs . Bloom , "" was my favorite as the 2 women stuck their heads out to converse . The door bell of that apartment never stopped ringing . People came in and out and would sit down to dinner as if it were nothing to invite themselves in . Gertrude Berg ( Molly ) had a kind Jewish heart and that was usually reflected by the rest of the cast . Her husband , Jake , worked in the garment industry in Manhattan . When he would come home , in a bad mood , watch out . Remember , "" Jake , your liver is on the table ? "" The show was up-to-date . As many Jewish families moved from the Bronx in the middle and late 1950s , the Goldbergs moved as well to Forest Hills in Queens . The show was nostalgic and was a testimony to Jewish people of that era . Too bad we can't sit down with some chicken soup , gefilte fish et al and watch some reruns .

I enjoyed this movie which while nothing new in respects to the old locked in the house surrounded by killers routine it manages to do a few new tricks here and there to surprise you . Basically like "" Night of the Living Dead "" , "" Dog Soldiers "" , and "" From Dusk till Dawn "" this movie has a group of people at their local bar just passing the night away as per the usual . Of course , it wouldn't be much of a movie if that was all there was to it . . . no just when we get acquainted with the characters in comes a character bloody and with a gun shouting warnings of an impending attack by monsters . Well the monsters do attack and there is lots of death and blood and people are eaten . The monsters do more than that too , but I will not go into any more detail than that . So who will live and who will die and who will be shot by panicking people are some of the many questions to be answered . Don't expect any information on the monsters , however , as they are just here to kill and have no origins in this movie . Which of course could result in a sequel , but then perhaps they will leave well enough alone and take this movie as is with nothing more to say .

Text2: Alfred Greven , the honcho of the German-run Continental Films during the Occupation , was a man of parts . He thought nothing of employing blackmail to ' perusade ' both Edwige Feuillere and Danielle Darrieux to work for his outfit and when Darrieux called a halt after three films he saw to it that she didn't work again until well after the war . With this one he seems to take a delight in pointing out to the French public that Germans didn't have a monopoly on ruthlessness and that the protagonist of Au Bonheur des dames , Mouret ( Albert Prejean ) would make a pretty good Nazi himself . Of course Greven was only putting on celluloid what Emile Zola had put on paper in the previous century - and which Julien Duvivier had already filmed at the dawn of the Sound Era with the exquisite Dita Parlo - but nevertheless he probably derived great satisfaction from chronicling the rise of one shopkeeper ( Prejean ) at the expense of another Baudu ( Michel Simon ) . Zola is thought to have based his emporium Au Bonheur des dames on Bon Marche , the oldest and still one of the most elegant of Parisienne Department Stores and just as Bonheur swallows up its neighbour La Viel Elbeuf so Bon Marche was eventually eclipsed by Galleries Lafeyette and Printemps . Michel Simon dominates every scene in which he appears as does Suzy Prim whilst Albert Prejean who SHOULD dominate does so only in terms of the storyline .

Text2: Here we go again . Why is it that people have to rate films on whether or not they are close to the book . Yes , I read prolifically , and I also watch many films . They are separate activities . Sometimes I want to see a movie because I love the book , but I realize that you can't do a book justice in 120 minutes . I bet Herman Wouk's The Winds of War was not done justice by the excellent mini-series - and it ran 883 minutes ! I judge a movie on the screenwriter's and director's vision . In that sense Brandon Boyce ( Venom ) did an outstanding job of presenting a story about evil and its affects on others . Bryan Singer ( The Usual Suspects , X-Men , X2 ) also did a superb job of directing so that there was not a wasted minute in this film . What can you say about Ian McKellen that hasn't been said already > He was captivating as a Nazi war criminal that was discovered by Brad Renfro ( The Client , 10th & Wolf ) . Renfro was also dead on as one who became consumed by the evil . This was a film that really makes you think .

But , of course , it's William H . Macy's show all the way and he delivers a terrific performance - vulnerable and generally perplexed , yet capable of incredible and unexpected violent outbursts ( even the subway scene , in which he verbally lashes out at a black woman who is unwilling to engage in a conversation with him , is priceless ) . Mamet deals with Fate and how it shapes someone's future in spite of oneself - as the motif of number 115 proves ; still , the film's suggestion that Macy's character ultimately finds contentedness behind bars as a homosexual is baffling and somewhat alienating ! All things considered , however , a good film - surprisingly but well handled by gore-meister Gordon - focused on telling its story vividly ( the sleazy L . A . nightlife , which I saw a bit of while in Hollywood late last year { ! } , providing an overpowering backdrop ) , concisely and , occasionally , with great power . The jazzy score is quite nice , too .

Text2: Richard Conte and Victor Mature play tough adversaries in "" Cry of the City , "" a 1948 film noir from 20th Century Fox , directed by Robert Siodmak . It also stars Shelley Winters , Debra Paget , Tommy Cook , Hope Emerson , Roland Winters and Barry Kroeger . Set on the streets of New York , the subways , the lower class neighborhoods , the film's atmosphere is perfect , although the story of gangster versus cop is derivative . Conte plays Martin Rome , a completely amoral thug who escapes from the prison hospital where he's recovering from bullet wounds . He manipulates and / or uses everyone he runs into in his quest to get some relief from his injuries , get money to leave town and find his girlfriend . His victims include an equally crooked attorney ( Kroeger ) , a she-man masseuse ( Emerson ) , an old girlfriend ( Winters ) , his mother and his brother . Meanwhile , another kid from the neighborhood , Lt . Candella ( Mature ) tries to find him and at the same time convince Martin's little brother that Martin's choices should not be his . The film is a little slow-moving at times , but Conte and Mature have never been better . There was always something a little dumb about Mature's performances - probably because he didn't take himself too seriously . Just as filming had started on a scene of 1984's "" Samson & Delilah , "" he announced to the entire cast and crew , "" I knew he was gay , "" when one of the actors sat next to a known gay actor . The scene had to be started over . Despite Mature's less than committed attitude , Robert Siodmak drew an excellent performance from him , possibly his best . The underrated Conte was always a force to be reckoned with , and this is one of his best roles . There are some stunning shots to be appreciated in "" Cry of the City "" - my favorite is as Rose Given takes a walk down her long hallway , the shadows that look like prison bars giving way to curtains and Rose's face and body walking into focus . Much to like here , but in the end , it's quite predictable , right down to the ending . But the acting , atmosphere and characters created are a real treat .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
560,"Text1: Relative newcomers , writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo , have concocted a testy little conundrum of a movie titled PREMONITION : whether the audience decides to step into their little nightmare or reject the premise that powerful emotions can drive the brain to peculiar directions of functioning will be the divisive break in acceptance of the film's premise . It is a fairly well done , thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast . The Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim ( Julian McMahon ) and wife Linda ( Sandra Bullock ) buy their new home . Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls ( Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness ) , a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim . Abruptly , Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend ( Nia Long ) and mother ( Irene Ziegler ) help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy . Yet Linda continues to ' relive ' moments : one day Jim is dead the next he is alive , and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda's mind become clues to investigate information she doesn't want to know . She encounters a warped psychiatrist ( Peter Stormare ) and a possible ' other woman ' in Jim's life ( Amber Valletta ) , and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense , she learns about the possible ' why ' of the mental state in which she is trapped . The film has problems holding credibility , but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps . Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely , gains our empathy , and in the end the film works because of her . She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well . No , this is not a great movie , but it is a well-produced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination , and that is a good thing ! Grady Harp

Text2: Steve Coogan is irresistibly entertaining in this offbeat film - a movie within a movie that crosses portions of a fine novel with the machinations if turning that novel into a film . Yes , this has been done successfully before , but rarely with the loonieness and candor that suffuses this entertaining insider look at making a novel visual . Director Michael Winterbottom and the entire cast and crew making the film Tristram Shandy follow a script ( by Frank Cottrell Boyce ) , but in a manner that feels like extemporaneous commentary on the 18th century Lawrence Sterne novel . Steve Coogan is introduced as the makeup artists are altering his nose and facial features to reflect those of Tristram while his co-star Rob Brydon is being transformed into the character of Captain Shandy . From conversations about technical aspects of shooting a film the camera splices into actual scenes from the ' movie ' , most of which deal with the birthing of Tristram . The purpose of the film reflects an aspect of the book about a man who is attempting to delve into the history and actions that result in the creation of the title character . The cast is strong : in addition to Coogan and Brydon , the minor roles are filled by Jeremy Northam , Kelly Macdonald , Shirley Henderson , Benedict Wong , Keeley Hawes , Gillian Anderson , Naomie Harris in addition to the costumers and makeup artists as well drawn characters in and of themselves ! For many the film may feel disjointed and meandering , but give into the concept of the delightful mix of shortcuts enhanced by commentary from the actors and crew and this Cock and Bull story is a terrific costume period piece romp . It is just meant to be fun and full of chuckles . Grady Harp","{""output"": ""YES""}"
561,"Text1: Leslie Charteris ' series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady Simon Templar ( "" The Saint "" ) was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming George Sanders as Templar . It was a careful choice - Sanders usually would play villains with occasional "" nice roles "" ( ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE , the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY , the framed "" best friend "" of Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN ) . Here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his "" heavy persona "" , while his good looks and suave behavior made Templar a fit shady hero like Chester Morris ' "" Boston Blackie "" , and ( to an extent ) Peter Lorre's "" Mr . Moto "" . The films are not the best series of movie mystery serials - but they are serviceable . Like Rathbone's Holmes series or Oland's Chan's series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones ( the anti-heroine in the film here was played by Wendy Barrie , who would show up in a second film in the series ) . This , and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers , who hear the buzz of the dialog ( always showing Sanders ' braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys ) , without noting the obvious defects of the plot . All these mysteries have defects due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can't avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again . Here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for Barrie , which she was long aware of . Shortly after he tries to protect her from the police . But as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind , it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind ( i . e . , the script disguised him as the least likely suspect ) . Barrie is after the proof that her father ( who died in prison ) was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang . She has several people assisting her - mugs like William Gargan - and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that can't be pinned on her . The D . A . who got her father convicted ( Jerome Cowan ) is determined to get Barrie and her gang . The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is Jonathan Hale , who is shadowing Sanders but reluctantly working with him . The cast has some nice moments in the script - Hale ( currently on a special diet ) is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner made for Sanders by Willie Best . He gets a serious upset stomach as a result , enabling Sanders and Barrie to flee Sanders ' apartment . Best has to remind him ( when he feels better ) to head for a location that Sanders told him to go to at a certain time . There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery . Usually playing decent people ( like the brow-beaten husband in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS ) he plays a socially prominent weakling here - whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a Bogart movie . On the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939 . It will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory .

Text2: This is one of those horror stories that just does not diminish over the years . An architect ( Mervyn Johns , in his best dramatic role ) is invited to the country home of a wealthy man ( Roland Culver ) and from the moment he drives up , he is aware that something familiar , and evil , is involved in this visit . Yet nothing bad is going on - it should be a routine visit . Still if it is a business visit , from the start it is not treated as a business visit . For one thing there is a set of guest at the home , including a psychiatrist ( Frederick Valk ) , a young girl ( Sally Ann Howe ) , a female family friend ( Googie Withers ) , and a racing car driver ( Anthony Baird ) . Johns acts nervously when he enters ( he recognizes the interior of the house as well as it's outside surroundings ) , and he explains the situation to Culver and the others . They reassure him nothing is wrong , and proceed to give him a drink and discuss unexplained occult phenomenon they have all experienced ( even the skeptical voice of reason Valk ) . It is these five experiences that take up the bulk of the film . Although it is a well known horror movie , I will avoid explaining the moment of horror and how it expands , involving all the stories in a fierce conclusion . This is the best "" Chinese Box "" story that has ever been put on screen , in that everything does fall into place . The irony ( for the viewer - and for Walter Craig , the nervous architect - is that we find at the end that the whole nightmare is about to begin all over again . The best of the sequences ( although a matter of taste ) are the racing driver's , the female friend's , and the psychiatrist's . The driver , recovering from a crash in a hospital , keeps having a nightmare where he sees a hearse outside his window at a certain time , with a driver ( Miles Malleson ) who repeats , "" Just room for one inside sir . "" This actually is a classic occult urban legend , as the face of the figure of doom reappears later at a key moment to scare the dream bearer into not proceeding with a normal act . The female friend's story is about how she and her husband barely manage to survive the acquiring of a Victorian mirror from an antiques dealer ( Esme Percy ) . The mirror , it seems , has a life and evil spirit of it's own , and nearly makes history repeat itself . The moment that raised this film to it's heights was the psychiatrist's tale . It deals with a ventriloquist ( Michael Redgrave ) who shoots a rival ( Hartley Power ) for trying to steal the affections of his dummy Hugo . Besides the obvious homosexual overtones of the story , the story has Redgrave's best film performance ( unless one counts his Jack Worthing in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST or his Andrew Crocker-Harris in THE BROWNING VERSION ) as the insane Maxwell Freer . It also has a chilling unexpected conclusion when Valk , trying to get to the heart of Redgrave's psychosis , unleashes a demon that nobody expected . The other two stories are less frightening - one ( Sally Howes ' story about a personal ghost experience , probably when she was visiting the English town of Road ) concerning an actual 1860 murder of a little boy , Francis Saville Kent . The murderer who was eventually punished ( his sister Constance ) survived a twenty year incarceration after her confession - and lived to be 101 in Australia . Nowadays , recent studies of that case suggest that Constance was not the killer - her father Samuel , or his mistress , the family nurse , may have killed Francis to keep him from talking to his mother about seeing a tryst . Constance loved her father , and may have taken the rap to protect him . However , Francis was her step-brother , not a full brother , and the originally investigation by the brilliant Scotland Yard Detective Jonathan Whicher in 1860 pointed to Constance as the killer . The least of the stories ( told by Culver ) is based on an amusing golf - ghost tale by H . G . Wells . It is a pleasant diversion ( it stars Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne as rival golf players ) , and allows the segment with Redgrave greater effect by coming just before it . The film has had effects ever since it came out . For instance , Danny Kaye ( who slightly resembles Redgrave ) played a ventriloquist with psychological problems ( or an independent dummy ) in KNOCK ON WOOD a few years later . A troublesome dummy named "" Gabbo "" ( also a reference to Eric Von Stroheim's THE GREAT GABBO ) briefly replaced "" Crusty the Clown "" in the rating of Springfield in THE SIMPSONS . But for the best effect it is Redgrave's moment of madness here , and the wonderful climax of this frightening movie . Are there better deja vu films ?

Text2: Over the years , many writers as well as filmmakers discovered that seemly innocent and cherubic looking children make extra-creepy horror villains ! Demonic kids almost form an entire sub genre of horror by themselves ! There usually is an explanation for their abnormal and murderous behavior , though . Either it's the influence of a satanic cult ( "" Children of the Corn "" ) , a nuclear meltdown ( "" The Children of Ravensbeck "" ) , a temporary blackout caused by a comet ( "" Village of the Damned "" ) or even an ordinary solar eclipse on the day of their birth ( "" Bloody Birthday "" ) . The youthful maniacs in this film have no real excuse for what they do . They were just born evil . And when their bus to the mental institute crashes down atop some snowy mountains , they become youthful maniacs AT LARGE ! They make it to a holiday resort where some wannabe godfather Corleone runs his crime syndicate and they start killing all the residents . "" Devil Times Five "" is not a very good movie , but that's mainly due to a lack of budget and a shortage of talented cast & crew members . There's very little going on in the first hour , apart from a spectacular bus crash and THE longest murder of an institute employee ( filmed in slow-motion ) . When approaching the last third of the film , the creepy moments and gory murders begin to follow each other at fast pace and the atmosphere really gets morbid . The adults are all pitiful and uninteresting characters but the five kids have quite interesting backgrounds . The oldest girl pretends to be a young convent sister , another girl is obsessed with fire and the funny black kid constantly acts like he's in the army . Their incontrollable urge to slaughter unknown people is a bit difficult to believe at times , but overall these young actors do a terrific job .

563,"Text1: OK , I know that Dan Curtis directed the original Trilogy of Terror , but come on , this was just insulting the original story . Now I wanted to see this because I was curious since I liked the original so much , it is such a classic that is very under rated . So when I saw this playing on the Sci-Fi channel , I didn't hesitate to watch it . Now the first two stories weren't too bad , a little cheesy , but so was the first . I think these stories were meant to be over the top , but the third one was where it went bad . The third story was just a total rip off the the original Zooney hunting doll , the exact same stunts were used along with the exact same lines , the funny thing is , I don't think it was possible , but the woman was definitely more stupid and deserved to be . . . well . . . you know . Well , the first story is about a woman where her husband dies and she discovers his grave is missing and encounters horrible things when she finds out there is more than what meets the eye . The second story was about a mother and her son , her son drowns , but the guilt of not being there drives her mad and she resurrects him from the dead . But unfortunately , there maybe something more she brought back with her son . Then the third story was about the Zooney Hunting Fetish Doll that has murdered two women , but the police think it's a cult type of murder and give the doll to a scientist in a museum , but little does she know the horror that comes with having this doll by her side . The only thing I enjoyed about the last story was that I did get more than a few laughs , especially where they did her grabbing the blade of the knife from the doll when he is trying to get out of the suitcase she locked him in , and she goes for the blade once , gets cut , she acts surprised , but does she learn anything ? No , she goes for it a second time ! This film just didn't have the elements the first one did , Dan should have just left the stories alone , they are perfect the way they are .

Alan Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen , returning from The Dentist ( 1996 ) to reprise his role ) is currently locked up inside . As he discusses his mental state with Dr . Cussler ( Rende Rae Norman ) he pulls a weapon out of a wound on his leg , holds it to her throat & makes his escape . . . Feinstone heads for a small rural town in Missouri called Paradise where he has stashed a load of cash under the name Dr . Lawrence Caine in one of the banks safety deposit boxes . He claims the money & is introduced by the bank manager Jeremy Wilkes ( Jeff Doucette ) to his attractive niece Jamie Devers ( Jillian McWhirter ) who offers him the opportunity to rent a small cottage she owns , Feinstone accepts . Shortly after one of Feinstone's caps in his teeth falls out & has to visit the local dentist Dr . Burns ( Jim Antonio ) who does a less than satisfactory job , in a fit of rage Feinstone kills Burns & makes it look like an accident . Feinstone is offered the opportunity of becoming Paradise's new dentist , he accepts . However he starts to lose his mind again in fits of jealousy over Jamie whom he has fallen in love with , one of the banks employees Bev ( Susanne Wright ) becomes suspicious & a private eye ( Ralph Martin ) hired by his tongueless vengeful wife Brooke ( Linda Hoffman ) discovers his whereabouts as his cosy new existence is threatened & begins to fall apart . . . Directed by Brian Yuzna The Dentist 2 plays a lot like the original . The script by Richard Dana Smith once again contains infidelity , moral decay , low dental hygiene standards & Feinstone taking his frustrations out on his unlucky patients as he slowly starts to lose his marbles , again . The main difference is that the film takes place in a rural setting rather than a big city , maybe The Dentist 2 is trying to say that decay eventually spreads everywhere ? It moves along at a fair pace although the varying story threads do take a while to come together & it doesn't really kick into gear until about the hour mark . Again like the original anyone who is afraid of going to the dentist may want to give this film a miss as it features some cool , but maybe disturbing to some , dental torture scenes as Dr . Feinstone is a man who enjoys his job . . . The Dentist 2 is more of a character study of the mental breakdown of a man rather than a teenage slasher film that have proved so popular , it's as much a psycho thriller as a horror . The character's are well developed & fleshed out which is unusual in a low budget horror such as this & I have to give it credit for being different & making an effort . Director Yuzna again delights in forcing the viewer to witness all sorts of dental torture & it's pretty strong stuff , scenes of plaque removers sticking into people's gums , dentist's drills destroying teeth & gums , exposed nerves , cut off tongues , a dream sequence which features a mouth full of crawling cockroaches , teeth mercilessly being pulled out , a hammer in someone's head , a needle stuck in someone's ear & a nasty torture scene when Bev really gets it . . . With a budget of about $1 , 800 , 000 The Dentist 2 is a very well made film throughout . The special effects are good & the acting is too with Bernsen really getting into the spirit of things , the now silent Linda Hoffman returns & she's still a bit of a babe . The Dentist 2 is a worthy sequel & a good film although I couldn't help but think it was very similar to the original , which in itself isn't a particularly bad thing . Well worth watching especially if you have a phobia about the dentist , it'll leave mental scars . . .

Text2: Falling Down starts on a gridlocked Los Angeles freeway , the seemingly ordinary William Foster ( Michael Douglas ) is stuck in his car on a swelteringly hot day , the noise of car horns & people shouting begins to bother him , then there's the fly which is buzzing around his head . Finally he snaps & gets out of his car & decides to walk home , on the way he wants to call his ex-wife Beth ( Barbara Hershey ) & check on his daughter Adele ( Joey Hope Singer ) . However he runs out of change , he goes into the nearest shop to ask for some but the owner ( Michael Paul Chan ) won't give him any . William completely flips & smashes the shop up with a baseball bat but still pays for his Coke , he sets off on foot across L . A . & gets into more trouble as he fights back against the things in society which annoy him . . . This French American co-production was directed by Joel Schumacher & is an interesting film that almost works , as it is it's a watchable piece of moralistic exploitation but it isn't quite the classic that it could have been . The script by Ebbe Roe Smith has a fascinating premise that many of us have probably thought about doing ourselves that of an ordinary man lashing out against the petty bureaucracy & the pressures of everyday life in a spectacular way . It's starts out terrifically with Douglas just leaving his car in the middle of a traffic jam because walking would be quicker & I just love the scene in the burger restaurant where he makes a impassioned speech about the difference in the picture of a burger & the one he actually gets as it's a scene I can really relate to ! However while Falling Down starts out as a dark comedic attack on consumerism & has a nice social commentary running through it the film doesn't do anything with it at all & quickly jettisons it in favour of a standard psycho on the loose & the police who are tracking him down type scenario which is nothing new & Douglas's character becomes like those he was initially targeting . By the time Douglas is using bazooka rocket launchers to blow freeway construction sites up the film has run out of steam & feels like it's forgotten it's own purpose . The ending where Douglas suddenly realises he has become the bad guy would have been good if the film had maintained it's attack on consumerism & petty law making but it doesn't so it isn't . Director Schumacher does alright , he keeps things moving along I suppose & there are some funny moments together with the more violent ones . I wouldn't call Falling Down an action flick but there are a few set-pieces here . The film starts out so well I'm not sure what happened to it but somewhere along the line it loses it's initial appeal . There's some violence , someone is stabbed in the shoulder , there's a drive by shooting , people are beaten with baseball bats & a construction site is blown up . The film also has racist overtones , Douglas comments on the Korean shop owner not being able to speak proper English as he smashes his shop up , all the gun wielding gangs are of Mexican origin , there's anti gay dialogue , one character is a Nazi who hates gays , blacks & foreigners , the homeless are portrayed as aggressive lying beggars & Douglas has a rant about the rich at the end in which he lets someone die because he's playing golf . Technically the film is very good with on location L . A . shooting , it certainly has that big budget look about it & it has high production values . The IMDb says that Falling Down was filmed between 29th April & 4th May 1992 , so the IMDb are saying Falling Down was shot in a week ! I think they need to find more reliable sources . . . The acting is OK , Douglas is alright as the anti-hero while Duvall is alright as the cop tracking him down . Falling Down could have been a classic had it been consistent throughout , as it is it's still an entertaining film with a dark humorous streak that I liked . It's a good film for sure but it could have been even better .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: As usual , I must say I'm in the minority with my critique , but I really enjoyed this one . My local hometown theater Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville , TN , actually experienced a decent turnout for a Monday matinée . We expected to be the only two in the audience . We were surprised . I can't say Roland Emmerich has found his way back to the beginning , because it is rather unclear what the beginning would consist of , but he HAS found his way back to favored and familiar ground . This ran , for me , like a secret prequel to Stargate . Honestly , the only thing lacking was a Stargate standing 3 mounds away in the distant background . For some , this may seem like a bad thing , but for me , it was delightful . While anthropologically ridiculous it IS a lot of fun , and the use of the word "" demon ? "" That word wasn't invented for another 11 , 000 years . While I will not even try to point to any specific historical data to substantiate Emmerich's vision of woolly mammoths assisting in the building of the great pyramids , the Shakara texts ( though written eight thousand years later ) DO indicate the presence of "" great beasts of burden "" at that time . Not that I would attack or defend this element . I found it beautiful , whether accurate , or not . So regardless of the probability that one should not learn from this film , one can still derive some level of entertainment from it . But there are many elements here I found common with Stargate . Here are the ones that rise a bit above commonality , which is shared with many other movies . The cultures appear nearly identical between the boy in the mountains and the people the Stargate travelers found .

Text2: SPOILERS German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler , Norman Rodway , in a purgatory-like in between or astral world bunker is seen reviewing his life and commenting on what he did as if he's arguing his case before a judge and jury in some higher court in the sky . Having with him a number of Hitler youths , blond and blue eyed golden nuggets as Hitler calls them , and two of his top henchmen Josef Gobbels and Hermann Goering , Joel Gray & Glenn Shadix , to make him feel at home ; together with an SS typist , Doug McKeon , who takes down every word that Hitler says . We the audience are given a deep and rare insight into Hitler's mind and what he thought of himself his place in history and the crimes that he committed during his lifetime . Hitler talking about his great accomplishments , good and bad , that made him undoubtedly one of the most feared recognized and written about persons in world history makes up most of the dialog in the film . In this in-between world of life and death is also Hitler's bride of one day , April 1945 , and long time mistress Eva Braun , Camilla Soeberg . There's also Sigmund Freud , Peter Michael Goetz , thrown into the movie who spends most of his time on screen psycho-analyzing Hitler to Hitler great annoyance and disgust . With films of his life as the German dictator played over and over on a number of screens all around the , what looks like , an underground bunker that he's in Hitler for the first time in his life , if he's indeed alive in the movie , admits to his many mistakes that brought about the disaster that fell upon himself and the country that he claims to love so much Nazi Germany . A lot of what Hitler says in the movie "" The Empty Mirror "" has mostly to do with his generals and how they double-crossed and betrayed him in the war by selling out to save their own necks at his and Germanys expense . We also see and hear Hitler crying about how he'll , sob sob , never be able to make the German capital of Berlin the great modern metropolis that he envisioned it to be ; with him seen sadly playing , like a little boy , with a toy scale model of the city . Hitler also admits that his two greatest mistakes in the war was his invasion of the USSR in the summer of 1941 and later that year declaring war against the United States as an obligation that he had to his Japanese allies , after that country's attack on Pearl Horbor . This just days after his panzer divisions were defeated and thrown back from the gates of Moscow by the Red Army and the brutal Russian Winter . The movie gets overly esoteric as Hitler starts to suddenly turn snow white and age becoming almost unrecognizable , looking like an unkempt and disheveled Captain Kangaroo , as he sees the results of his actions , that throughout the movie he tried to overlook and ignore . Hitler sees films of liberated concentration camps and the thousands of dead found in them and literally goes mad as if that's his ultimate punishment . Interesting but just a bit too talky of a movie with Hitler , as if he's in a Broadway Musical , having a number of unnecessary costume changes as if to show us in the audience what and extensive wardrobe he had and how good he look wearing it . We even see Hitler cracking jokes , which no one with him in the bunker would dare , about himself as if he were doing some stand-up comic routine . The films of Hitler and Nazi Germany get a bit too much since they never for once let up and give you a chance to digest what's happening in the movie . By the time "" The Empty Mirror "" is over your almost as worn out watching the movie as Hitler or actor Norman Rodway is in being in it .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

569,"Text1: When I typed Savage Intruder into the IMDb's search engine one of the options it came up with was Savage Garden : International Video Collection : The Story so Far ( 1999 ) , the only reason I mention this is because I'm a huge Savage Garden fan & you should do yourself a favour & check some of their music out like Affirmation or To the Moon and Back rather than bother with this average pot-boiler , sorry I just wanted to say that . Anyway , Savage Intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM musical & premiere footage & a few spinning portraits which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run . It's late 60's Hollywood & amid the glitz & glamour a serial killer is at work selecting ageing actresses , killing them & dismembering their bodies . A young man named Vic Valance ( David Garfield as John David Garfield ) hops off a tour bus looking for employment when it stops at the house of a now retired actress , Katharine Parker ( Miriam Hopkins ) who was ' one of the biggest stars of the motion picture ' but now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred ( Florence Lake ) , a personal secretary Leslie Blair ( Gale Sondergaard ) & a young maid named Geta ( Virginia Wing ) . Katharine has recently broken her foot & needs a personal assistant & gives Vic the job . Slowly Vic charms his way into Katharine's affections & more importantly her large wallet . Vic starts to turn Katharine against the other employees , but Vic isn't what he seems . Vic is a drug addicted loon who gets Greta pregnant while still having sex with Katharine . Greta threatens to tell Katharine & spoil Vic's devious plans but she has a close encounter with an axe , no one in the house is safe as Vic brings drugs , sex , rock ' n ' roll party's & gardening to the Parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more & more apparent . . . Written , produced & directed by Donald Wolfe I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time . The script is all over the place & it can't really decide what it wants to be , Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis ! The film starts with the discovery of a severed head & limbs , straight after another woman ( Dorothy Kingston ) is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure but then it completely ditches the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them . Savage Intruder then becomes a sort of feel good film as Vic befriends Katharine & shows her how to enjoy life again & having an implied sexual relationship with her , it's actually disgusting to think about as she's old enough to be his Grandmother . Katharine stops living the life of a recluse & gives up the alcohol as Vic appears to make her happy as they go to party's together & hold banquets for Katharine's friend like she used too . This part of Savage Intruder wouldn't look out of place in a Disney film ! Every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by Vic shooting up & having silly hallucinations about his Mother ( Sybelle Guardino ) & chopping her hand off with an axe , he has sex with Great at one point as well . Then , after Greta has been murdered , Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as Vic is revealed for the loony that he is . Savage Intruder just doesn't flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success . Similarly the murder mystery elements don't work & are frankly a bit of a puzzle , why go to great lengths to conceal the killers identity during the murder scenes but then make it perfectly clear who is committing them throughout the rest of the film anyway ? Vic as a character didn't work for me either , one moment he's a cool , calm , clever & devious con man & then next he's a stark raving loony ! Why kill all his other victims but with Katharine try to con her ? What makes her so different ? If it is because she has money why not go after her to start with ? So many questions & so few answers . . . Some of the 60's dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days like when Vic offers Greta a painkiller , in reality hard drugs , & Greta says "" what do I need a painkiller for ? "" , Vic helpfully replies "" because your a pain "" wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies ! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic do some gardening & ask's "" do you have green fingers ? "" he replies "" no , but I'm good at grass ! "" There isn't much gore in Savage Intruder , some severed limbs & a couple of decapitated heads . There is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut off with an axe which is probably why it's repeated three or four times . The silly looking drug hallucination scenes need to be seen to be believed . Technically Savage Intruder is OK , the location filming in the grandiose mansion & Hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves , the acting is average as is the rest of the production . Overall I'd say Savage Intruder feels like it tries to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away & as a result just doesn't work . It's a mildly entertaining one-time-watch at best & a complete mess of a film at worse , you decide which !

Text2: The Dunwich Horror starts as a strange fellow named Wilbur Whateley ( Dean Stockwell ) ask's college professor Dr . Henry Armatige ( Ed Begley ) whether he can borrow the magical book of the Necronomicon , Armitage refuses . Whateley's sinister attention then turns to college student Nancy Wagner ( Sandra Dee ) who offer's Whateley a lift home to the small town of Dunwich after it turns out he missed the last bus , it turns out to be a less than inspired decision as Whateley ' fixes ' her car so she can't go anywhere & convinces her to stay for the weekend . Dr . Armitage & Nancy's friend Elizabeth ( Donna Baccala ) become worried when she doesn't return & set out to look for her , Elizabeth has the unfortunate luck to find the ' thing ' which lurks in the attic in Whateley's house while after some investigation Armitage discovers that Whateley is in fact trying to resurrect an ancient race of evil beings from another dimension & he plans to use Nancy as the virgin sacrifice . . . Directed by Daniel Haller The Dunwich Horror is far from the best film out there but if your in the right mood & have a certain aptitude for this sort of over-the-top badly dated horror film from the 70's then you might just like it . The script by Curtis Hanson , Henry Rosenbaum & Roland Silkosky was based on the short 27 page story by H . P . Lovecraft & you can tell because this film is pretty stretched out , to be fair not that much actually happens apart from Whateley kidnapping Nancy & her friends come looking for her before the sinister truth is revealed which is pretty obvious to begin with . Hving said that The Dunwich Horror is full of bizarre scenes which make it watchable on a ' what the hell ? ' sort of level . There's Whateley's weird Grandfather who carries what resembles a large lollipop around with him , the scenes when the thing from the attic attacks & the whole screen flashes red & everyone just sort of falls over or the bits in the insane asylum which are funny & then there's the bit when Nancy is enquiring about her friend Elizabeth whose car is outside & who has met the thing from the attic but within the space of a half a scene Nancy suddenly loses all interest in her so-called best friend who is missing . It doesn't have a great pace to it , it's not particularly exciting , it takes itself far too seriously & it lacks exploitation elements but I thought it was an entertaining laugh all the same . Director Haller adds much unintentional hilarity to the proceedings , the way people talk , behave , the set-ups , the story & the film is terribly dated which adds a certain charm to it . The opening credits are amazing & worth watching on their own , I doubt there's many like them around . There's nothing one would describe as being scary & there's no blood or gore either . Technically The Dunwich Horror is OK , it looks like a 70's detective show with some very garish colours & embarrassing fashions . I have to say though that I really rather liked the music . The acting is either terrible if it was unintentional but an absolute brilliant masterstroke if it was deliberate . The Dunwich Horror is a entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes for all the wrong reasons , for those who like their films pretty out there . Remade as Dunwich ( 2006 ) .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

571,"Text1: Those who come to "" Kind Hearts and Coronets "" because of the reputation of Alec Guinness's performance ( or rather performances ) may find themselves disappointed in this dark comedy from Britain's Ealing studios . Not because Guinness's performance is bad , but because there's much less of it than admirers would have you believe . Guinness has nowhere nearly as much screen time as Dennis Price , who plays a vengeful family outcast who decides to murder the eight other family members standing between him and a dukeship . Though Guinness plays all eight of the doomed relatives , he doesn't get much time as any of them , and he doesn't give them the colorful characterizations I was expecting . The film is humorous at times , but quite slow and even rather boring at others . It's capped by a clever ending , but overall the movie is not the masterpiece it's been hyped up to be .

The French Resistance invites and teaches him to kill Germans and traitors . When the war ends , he continues to kill and is arrested , judged and sentenced to death in the guillotine . While in prison waiting for a possible presidential pardon claimed by his lawyer , he meets other prisoners also waiting for the dishonored death . "" Nous Sommes Tous des Assassins "" is the most impressive movie against capital sentence that I have ever seen . The lawyer André Cayatte wrote and directed this film where the defendant is actually the hypocrisy of the whole society , the church and the justice system . He does not spare the prejudgment and behavior of every social class , mostly the dominant class , to defend his opinion about the lack of humanity in the French prisons for the prisoners waiting for the executioner . In my country , we do not have capital sentence , but in my opinion this great movie is manipulative , using very sad and unfair examples to justify the position of the author . I agree that children and those that need should be assisted by the State but in spite of being fruit of the society , criminals destroy families and must pay for their crime the same way the families grieve their beloved loss .

Text2: Spoiler . . . They say this film influenced others ; well it is average by today's standards . This film builds great tension but is dated and laps over periods of time . The relentless tension build up is what makes this movie . The scare factor is very tame , and predictable for today's standards . Plot twists , this is before call trace and shows the age of this film , where they have to wait to trace the caller and find out he is calling from the house . I could see this one coming right from the get go . The comic relief is awful , the 70's must have been the I don't care rude and crude generation that reflects today's social decay . The swearing , perverseness , drinking , and rude comments had a shock humor element then , but in today's Jenny Jones , Jerry Springer society make one's eyes roll . It seems in that era of filming everyone has to yell , for many of us who work customer service just find it idiotic , not funny , or even amusing . ( explains why so many disgruntled customers have the 70's styled mustaches , leather vests and boots ) . I work at the Post Office and see this daily , and with my experiences with unbalanced people I find the caller's messages scary . They must have experience with these phone calls or studied mental illnesses . The caller rants , rambles , repeats himself , and goes on a senseless tangent . A different sense of reality .

Although this slapstick effort is one of Melies ' weaker movies , there are a couple of interesting points : first , the cutting definitely uses Magic lantern grammar , as we see the enmattressed tramp leave the street and enter a bar . There is a cut to the interior of the bar and it is several seconds before the lively mattress enters . This is typical of magic lantern pieces and was already being superseded in movies , since the effect is too slow for the anticipation of the audience . Second , there is a title card near the end - - still something of a novelty - - followed by a shot of the tramp , something typical for the slapstick efforts that Pathe would become known for starting the following year . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA .

But while Griffith made his pieces in this vein morally ambiguous , preferring to raise questions without coming up with answers in which he himself had little faith , Christy Cabanne takes a much more melodramatic position : the rich are evil , the rich are hypocritical and the poor and downtrodden will suffer at their hands Which is a superior line to take ? I admire Griffith's ability to tread that narrow line , to excite questions that are still unanswered - - but for pure story telling , Cabanne's methods are better , particularly given that Biograph's audience was poor and urban - - just the sort that feels oppressed by the rich .

574,"Text1:  Riders of the Whistling Pines  is a cool sounding title , and the story itself is not your run of the mill Western . Set in ' modern ' times so to speak , automobiles and airplanes are very much in evidence , and there's even a reference to World War II . After being exonerated for the accidental death of a forestry agent , Gene Autry's character is ready to give up his newly formed sportsmen's club and move away . However when his singing buddies ( The Cass County Boys ) admit they tampered with his rifle sight , Gene decides to stick around to find out if the death of Charles Carter might have been murder . It seems to me that Gene found himself on the wrong side of an environmental issue in this one though . He repeatedly defended the use of DDT to control a larval outbreak that threatened the forest , and by extension , the area's logging industry . Every time he stated that the spray was safe for animals and fish , he sounded like an apologist for the chemical industry . If filmed today , Gene might have turned out to be the villain of the piece instead of lumber company owner Henry Mitchell ( Douglas Dumbrille ) . Instead , Mitchell employed two henchmen to do his dirty work , one of them being a virtually unrecognizable Clayton Moore hiding behind an unkempt beard . No matter how tough things get , there's always plenty of time for a passel of songs , and for a film coming in at just over an hour , Gene knocks out five tunes while the Cass County Boys add another ; and let's not forget the tune by the Pinnafores trio . For this viewer , there were two major sit up and take notice events in the film . In an early scene , the forestry agent Carter and henchman Wright arrive at the Cedar Ridge Sportsmen's Camp requesting to use the phone . At the time of this posting , the part of Carter is listed by IMDb as Jason Robards Sr . However if you view that scene closely , you will easily recognize the face of Bob Hope ! The other giveaway is Hope's unmistakable voice , especially when off screen attempting to make that phone call . And the other ? When Gene sets up Mitchell with word that his buddy Joe will be able to identify the man who shot him , Mitchell and his boys make for Gene's camp to do away with him . Mitchell shoots who he thinks is Gene in a rocking chair on the porch , but it turns out to be a life size dummy of Gene ! Now why would Gene Autry have one of those ? ? ?

Text2: The Oblong Box is a delightful treat for the horror fan . Starring two of the genre's great legends - Vincent Price and Christopher Lee and ( albeit loosely ) based on a story penned by the master of the macabre , Edgar Allen Poe , could it be anything but an immense slice of horror entertainment ? The answer would seem to be no as this tale of disfigurement , voodoo , premature burial and revenge hits all the right spots . There are a lot of themes going on in the movie , and because of this the storytelling gets a little messy at times - but it doesn't matter , as whenever the story takes a downturn , it's strong leads are always on hand to ensure that it never gets boring . The story follows a man who keeps his brother , who has been hideously deformed as a result of a voodoo curse , locked up in the attic . After his plan to escape goes awry , the deformed brother finds himself in the laboratory of Christopher Lee's mad scientist . . . It's true that neither Vincent Price nor Christopher Lee deliver their best performance in this movie , but come on - it's two legends , in the same movie together . They could just sit around and throw coins at a wall and I'd be riveted ! The expansive plot gives way to a tale of terror with many different angles , and this allows the film to take in many intriguing elements . Poe's favourite topic - being buried alive - features quite heavily , and is done in a very effective way towards the end . Voodoo will always be a fascinating subject as there's so much that can be done with it , and the idea of having someone disfigured as the result of a curse borders on genius . There's no black cat in the film , but we do have a strong revenge theme that echoes such classics as "" The Invisible Man "" in the way it's presented . As mentioned , it does get a little messy ? but there's enough intrigue in each section of the story for it not to really matter . When the brother's face is finally shown , it is a little disappointing but it hardly matters as it's backed up by a great ending that actually manages to be quite frightening !","{""output"": ""NO""}"
575,"Text1: This is another good Spaghetti Western , one that even got a laudable appraisal in the "" Leonard Maltin Film Guide "" ? not to mention the seal of approval of our own Michael Elliott ! Actually , it's a character-driven piece ? with the action spread neatly throughout yet proficiently executed . Besides , it's exceedingly well cast : ageing American star Van Heflin is excellent in one of his last roles ; both Gilbert Roland ( himself a Hollywood veteran ) and especially George Hilton did their fair share of Spaghettis , but it's safe to assume that they were never better than here ; Klaus Kinski , then , has a typically enigmatic role for which he sports numerous eccentric ' costumes ' ( from preacher's garb to shades to a raincoat over his head and even a makeshift turban ! ) . Unfortunately , as had been the case with THE SPECIALIST ( 1969 ) , the copy I acquired ( English-dubbed this time around ) lapsed occasionally into a different language without the benefit of subtitles ? but , whereas I could more or less make out what was being said in French with respect to the Sergio Corbucci film , here it's in German ( even the print bears the title DAS GOLD VON SAM COOPER ) ! In any case , the narrative ? bringing an old-fashioned situation up-to-date , stylistically speaking ? deals with Heflin's striking gold and his attempt to find suitable partners ( his previous one had already tried to double-cross him ! ) that would help him extract the precious element : what he ends up with is an interesting bunch ? Hilton , the miner's former protégé ( who's not as clean-cut as Heflin seems to think ) ; the young man's domineering companion , Kinski ( who's actually quite subdued here ) ; and Roland , another old-timer ( who , bearing Heflin a personal grudge , will no doubt look out for him from being ' jumped ' by the others [ ! ] ? though he's ultimately revealed to have appointed a cowboy duo to shadow the ' expedition ' before they think , erroneously , of cutting in on the deal ) . Carlo Rustichelli's score is , again , more traditional than most genre efforts but robust nonetheless ; that said , it breaks into a semi-lounge piece more suited to a German "" Krimi "" during the scene in which Kinski drops some gear while ascending a mountain and has to be tied in order to go back down and retrieve it ( given that this is one of the scenes presented exclusively in German , could it be that the music was changed in that country ? ) ! The film was co-scripted by Fernando Di Leo ( a Spaghetti Western regular during this time but who never actually contributed to the genre after graduating to director ! ) and Augusto Caminito ( who , as a film-maker in his own right , would make a couple of pictures with Kinski towards the end of the actor's life ? including the little-seen GRANDI CACCIATORI [ 1988 ] , which I have in my "" To Watch "" pile of obscure "" Euro-Cult "" titles recorded off Italian TV ! ) . Curiously enough , co-producer Luciano Ercoli would also subsequently get to be a director ? proving a notable exponent of the Giallo form .

Text2: The Browning / Lugosi ' classic ' has always been one of my favorite Universal horror films but , ever since the simultaneously-produced ' rival ' Spanish version resurfaced , the ' original ' has taken a beating by fans and historians alike - mainly because the latter features superior camera-work ! This , however , is the ONLY area where it can lay a claim to be better in when compared to the US version ( the fact that leading lady Lupita Tovar had a sexier wardrobe than Helen Chandler shouldn't even be considered , I guess ) . Still , the fact that on the DVD the opinion that the seminal US version is the inferior one seems to be shared by quite a few people hasn't done it any favors ! I remember being impressed by the Spanish version when I first watched it in 2001 , singling out for praise the performance of Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield and , of course , George Robinson's cinematography . However , coming back to it now , I felt that Rubio's hysterical rendering of the character ( which reminded me of Gene Wilder in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN [ 1974 ] of all people ! ) was nowhere nearly as nuanced as Dwight Frye's unforgettable characterization in the US version . Regarding the "" superior camera-work "" , I guess this is true for individual sequences ( Dracula's introduction , for instance ) but , frankly , I never felt that Karl Freund - a pioneer of the moving camera - had somehow been restrained by Tod Browning , who admittedly wasn't very fond of this technique . Given that of late we've also been faced by the ridiculous assumption that Browning didn't actually direct the film , he couldn't have - since he wasn't even there ! ! It may be however , that since frequent Browning collaborator Lon Chaney ( who had been slated for the title role ) died before shooting began , the director sort of lost heart in the project - coupled also with the fact that the script was rather talky , another element with which Browning felt uneasy ! Well , whatever went on behind the scenes , for me what's in front remains one of the highlights of the American horror film - from the marvelous dialogue ( especially as delivered - each in their own unique way - by Lugosi , Frye and Edward Van Sloan ) , irreproachable performances ( Frye and Van Sloan were at their best , while Lugosi only ever really came close with THE BLACK CAT [ 1934 ] and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN [ 1939 ] ) and memorable individual scenes ( the entire first act set in Transylvania , the confrontation scenes between Dracula and his nemesis Professor Van Helsing , Renfield's various ravings ) . The tame ending may appear anti-climactic to most people but I honestly was never bothered by it ! If anything , this was remedied in any number of ways in subsequent outings . . . Which brings us back to the Spanish Dracula : like I said , the film is an interesting and altogether pleasing ' alternate ' to the Lugosi version . . . but it is fatally compromised by the inadequate leading performance of Carlos Villarias , whose bulging eyes and feral snarls can't hold a candle to Lugosi's definitive screen vampire ! This version does go to places where the American doesn't ( Browning shies away from the vampire attacks , for instance ) and even features ' new ' scenes like the aftermath of the vampiric Lucy's demise - but , at 104 minutes ( a full half-hour longer than the US version , when considering that they were following the same script ! ) it's way overlong for its own good . The Browning / Lugosi version is often criticized for its sluggishness but this one actually moves at a snail's pace : take , for instance , the famous scene where Dracula is exposed by the mirror - Lugosi knocks the box down immediately , while Villarias takes forever to do so ( even if his resolution is effectively flamboyant nonetheless ) . A word about the DVD quality : disappointingly , the Spanish version features closed-captions ( for the hearing-impaired ) rather than proper subtitles . As for the US version , the print utilized for this particular transfer ( which differs from that of the original , and more satisfactory , 1999 release ) is a bit too dark for my taste and the dialogue sometimes was hard to catch due to the incessant hiss on the soundtrack ! It also reverts to the ' original ' single groan during Dracula's staking ( instead of the elongated variant available on the earlier disc ) . . . but does feature a bit of music at the end of the Opera sequence , which had been missing from the previous edition ! ! Well , this only means that it's worth keeping both copies of Dracula as neither is really definitive . . .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

In an era when people automatically associated the Science-Fiction genre with either hideous invincible creatures ( "" Alien "" ) or adventurous fantasy ( the "" Star Wars "" - trilogy ) , this movie actually attempts to make a character-study / drama using exclusively Sci-Fi characters . "" Android "" feels like a successful mixture between the themes of "" Saturn 3 "" and even the embittered atmosphere the almighty classic "" Blade Runner "" . That is highly ambitious and praiseworthy , especially since the credits list Roger Corman's name as an executive producer and during that time he was mostly infamous for his excessively violent and exploitative rip-offs . The always amazing Klaus Kinski gives a perplexing performance as a mysterious scientist , illegally constructing androids in a space-station far far away . Dr . Daniel is continuously preoccupied with his work whilst his android assistant Max 404 plays videogames and secretly craves to learn more about being a human . The arrival of three fugitive criminals drastically alters their existence . One of them is namely a woman , and both Dr . Daniel and Max are enchanted by her appearance albeit for totally different reasons . The good doctor finally sees an opportunity to research the possibility of a female android and Max discovers emotions he didn't even know existed . It gets worse when Max learns he's disposable and rebels against superior . "" Android "" benefits most from its witty and inventively written script . The film is most impressive when relying on substance and acting performances , as the special effects and decors appear miserably cheap and tacky . The "" surprise "" ending is efficient and unpredictably without being overly far-fetched . Kinski is , as said , genius is his familiar role of eccentric and slightly offbeat scientist , but Don Opper ( who also co-wrote the film ) is at least equally astounding as Max 404 . Not only does he look uncanny and artificial , but his grimaces and movements are truly spot-on ! Extra admirable is that neither Don Opper nor director Aaron Lipstadt had any cinematic experience before they worked on "" Android "" together . This may be an anonymous and underrated movie , but to me it's one of the most remarkable films of the 80's . Highly recommended .

Text2: Long before Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez even considered the idea , other ambitious fan-boy directors already attempted to revive the Grindhouse cinema . Of course , these directors were inexperienced and unknown , so their movies never properly received the attention they deserved . Todd Morris ' "" A Gun for Jennifer "" is a prototypic example to state this theory . Judging by the story content , the gritty filming style and the excessive amount of graphic violence , it is plain obvious that Morris watched way too many exploitation & trash movies as a kid and then suddenly decided one day to gather together a bunch of friends to shoot his very own and cheap homage to 70's Grindhouse cinema . Well , I can only applaud Todd Morris and everyone else involved in this production , as I could only dream about realizing such a project of my own . Everything about "" A Gun for Jennifer "" is extremely basic and gratuitous - subject material as well as the elaboration - but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad . Quite the contrary even ; a straightforward plot , amateurish acting and clumsy camera-work are almost fundamental characteristics in order to achieve an authentic Grindhouse movie ! Todd Morris borrows and even shamelessly copies several elements from older films , notably "" I Spit on your Grave "" , Abel Ferrara's "" Ms . 45 "" and the virtually unknown "" Rape Squad "" . It's about a beautiful young woman who flees from Ohio to New York City , for reasons explained later in the film , and almost immediately becomes the victim of scum rapists . She gets rudely rescued when a van full of tough chicks passes by and kills the rapists without hesitating . The girls apparently all work together in a nightclub and , since they got a little fed up with the endless amount of unsolved rape cases and various other acts of violence against women , they decided to form some sort of vigilante posse and roam the streets at night . Since she has nowhere else to go and because , after all , these women rescued here , the girl ? choosing the false Jennifer ? joins the gang . She gradually gets sucked more and more into a world of vengeance and violence , but also the fanatic female police detective Perez comes closer to uncovering their identities . What we have here , my dear fellow smut & exploitation fanatics ( as you are the only ones likely to read the comments for this type of movies ) , is an almost perfect tribute to politically incorrect early 70's trash ! The characters are complete stereotypes ( all men are scum , all women are tough mothers ) , the sleaze-level is extremely high in spite of very little nudity shown on screen , the soundtrack and photography make you feel uncomfortable and the violence is uncompromising to say the least . Although bringing little variety in the killings , "" A Gun for Jennifer "" is literally a bloodbath of a film and particularly the climax goes far over the top in depicting sick and sadistic ferocity . Deborah Twiss , who also co-wrote the screenplay , as well as her girlfriends aren't likely to win any major acting awards in their careers but the have the exact right looks , charisma and tough facials expression for this kind of role . The soundtrack is simply amazing and contains some marvelously apt songs . If you want to know what I'm referring to , just look up Moloko's "" Killa Bunnies "" on YouTube ! Purely talking in terms of good cinema , "" A Gun for Jennifer "" probably doesn't deserve a rating any higher than 5 or 6 , but I'm generously giving an 8 for sheer respect towards Todd Morris and his crew .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Low-budget film played the Palm Springs movie circuit for months but didn't hit many other towns ; easy to see why , it's rather like an R-rated sitcom lost on the big screen . While Shores isn't exactly erratic as a director , he's possibly too flexible with his material and his group of actors , and the movie sometimes resembles nothing more than a stunt . There's not much plot ( it's just an exercise in showcasing the worst possible sides of humanity for a dirty laugh ) , yet some good things do come out of this . Leslie Jordan pulls off a difficult transvestite role with un-self-conscious relish ; not played for pitiable sympathy or all-out laughs , Jordan's Tammy Wynette-worshipping drag queen amiably walks a fine line - - it's a portrayal dead-on in its accuracy , and Jordan is never a pain like the other characters . Delta Burke and Bonnie Bedelia visibly strain to punch up their scenes , while Olivia Newton-John opens the picture with a rousing song but is given nothing else important to do .

580,"Text1: For a Western movie this was very boring and had very little going on . There is no real plot and only a couple of muddled and drama-free sub-plots . The movie is about some hit-man in a cell who is awaiting hanging for the killing of some cattleboys . The sheriff wants a peaceful hanging ( ! ) without having to prove that he's as good a Sheriff as his father was . And a couple of other minor characters serve no purpose other than to complicate matters for petty reasons . There are a few silly fight scenes that remind of the A-Team with the wooden furniture falling apart very easily . And , as always , there are embarrassingly fake fights in which there is no penetration seen or any shown . Were there any R-rated movies in the 50's ?

Text2: Coming a couple of years after the far more accomplished Dark Crystal this is relatively straight-forward but still a helluva lot more imaginative than any family movie of recent years . You could call it a modern fairy tale , but it's just not deep enough . And for a film called Labyrinth , it's strangely uncomplicated . Jennifer Connelly ( younger and prettier , though her acting is questionable ) stars as Sarah , a teenager who bizarrely doesn't have a boyfriend and ends up living in her own fantasy world . Her dad and stepmother go out , leaving her to babysit her baby brother . Annoyed with his crying she utters a magical spell , wishing the goblins to take him away . Sure as sugar , the Goblin King himself ( Tina Turner , oh sorry . . . I mean David Bowie ) turns up and takes away the screaming tot . In order to get him back she must solve ' The Labyrinth ' ( cue dramatic music ) and reach the Goblin King's Castle within 13 hours . Along the way she meets new friends ( of the Jim Henson variety ) in the form of Hoggle the dwarf , big , hairy and cuddly Ludo and cute little fox Sir Didymus . It's pleasant enough entertainment but there are some serious problems . The most serious of them all is David Bowie's attire . Most specifically , his trousers , they are a little revealing in the crotch department to make an understatement . You'll cringe , you'll avert your eyes , yet you'll be mesmerized . Come on , how could this have been allowed in a family movie . Plus , Trevor Jones ' score is disappointingly unmagical and the filmmakers have given in to the urge to have David Bowie crank out some dreadfully 80's tunes that stagger the action and hold up the plot . It's a shame to call Labyrinth nostalgic . But if it were made today it would be full of hollow CGI . There's something charming in practical effects and puppetry ( or is that Muppetry ? ) that no computer graphic can generate . The photography and is stunning and it captures landscape and fantasy perfectly . And all those cute Jim Henson characters are far more interesting than any Hobbit . Filmed in Panavision , the 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic picture looks good . But not exceptionally so . Columbia are so hyped up over their Superbit releases . And that's fine when considering newer movies . But for a film like Labyrinth we really should have a brand new , hi-def remastering . THAT would have looked super . What we have however is just a good-looking movie . There's hardly any grain , no dirt ( surprising considering the age of the print ) and perfect colors . Originally recorded in Dolby Stereo , the first DVD release was in 2 . 0 surround only . For this Superbit release Columbia have given us a full 5 . 1 track in Dolby Digital and DTS . How does it sound ? Like 2 . 0 surround . There is hardly any deep bass . It's front speaker biased , with little or no surround use and there's practically no difference between the Dolby or DTS tracks . We could have been given a full 6 . 1 track with stronger remastering of the original sound elements . How cool would that be ? As this is a Superbit , there are no extras . The original DVD release had an hour long documentary on it . But this Superbit is only slightly better in quality , so it's up to you to decide which one you want .

581,"Text1: Overall , I have to rate Terror Eyes as a shame , as it has so much going for it ; but unfortunately , most of it is lost under terrible plotting , which often reduces the film to merely a lot of death scenes strung together . Terror Eyes appears to take a lot of influence from the popular Italian Giallo sub-genre , and that is never a bad thing ; although the film still fits firmly into the slasher sub-genre , which often is a bad thing . The modus operandi of the killer here is rather odd , but it works rather well as we follow a biker dressed all in black leathers who enjoys going round decapitating various members of a night school , before dumping their heads in the nearest container of water . Naturally , all this carnage prompts a police investigation ; but the officers on the case are more interested in spurting terrible lines of dialogue than finding the killer , and so the murders continue . We are introduced to several red herrings along the way , although suspicion often seems to fall on the school's anthropology professor . My only reason for seeing this film is due to the fact that it was included on the DPP Video Nasty list back in the eighties . However , it turns out that this is one of the many films that don't deserve their place on a list of notorious films , as there's very little blood and even macabre incidents such as severed heads being thrown into fish tanks etc never seem very shocking . The film is directed by Ken Hughes , the same man responsible for both the James Bond spoof Casino Royale and , rather more shockingly , children's classic Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ! It's seems obvious that one of the film's problems is that the director isn't experienced in directing horror films , and this is shown through the almost complete lack of suspense and blasé attitude when it comes to the plot . The film doesn't feature any big name stars , although Rachel Ward makes a mark and the rest of the support cast aren't too bad considering the material they were working with . Overall , I'd like to have liked this film more ; the Giallo influences are good and the film has potential , but this is not realised and Terror Eyes is merely a mundane slasher flick .

Text2: While I've yet to see all of what many consider to be THE document of 20th century Olympics in Riefensthal's Olympia ( it is , of course , a very long movie , and we only saw bits in a class ) , this document of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics by Kon Ichikawa is quite the spectacle on its own . Ichikawa understands something that five years later Michael Wadleigh , director of Woodstock , would understand about filming an event ( though Woodstock will always be the better , more incredibly watchable film for me ) . And it is , simply put , to make it an EVENT - in bold letters - for people who may not even really usually watch the Olympics . The way he uses his many , many , many cameras an exhaustively large crew is staggering , and just in the first half hour or so , when the countries all line up and the audience fills in as the games kick off , it's done in a very dynamic style . He alternates interestingly between big wide shots of the crowds ( like Woodstock , seeming larger than it really is with everyone packed in thousands of masses ) , the stadium itself , and then to close-ups of individuals and bodies moving . It's this side of the film , the technical one , that is most worthwhile to see in the film . If it's less than perfect , it's because , frankly , it almost does become ' too much ' to see so many games that go on in the near three-hour running time . And the narration voice that pops up now and again sounds way too much like a narrator from old newsreels , trying to add emphasis where it's not really needed . It's too immense an event with too many goals vied for victory to add on extra words . But there are highlights though , such as the 100 meter dash , done in a slow-motion that might echo some of Ichikawa's other narrative films . And the Joe Frazier boxing match , while brief , is memorable . Sometimes Tokyo Olympiad comes off almost like an avant-garde film as much as it does just straight-on documentary , and it's here that I got drawn in . Of all major events involving sports and other games and activities and trials and such , the Olympics brings together all cultures for the sake of competing for a country's honor and respect , and Ichikawa has a very good balance between showing that and adding a distinct style to the numerous events . In fact , Ichikawa has what might be the best avant-garde sports documentary ever made , at least in the past forty or so years .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

584,"Text1: CASA DE AREIA ( ' HOUSE OF SAND ) is a masterpiece of film-making from Brazil . Written by Elena Soarez and Luis Carlos Barreto the story seems more a magical metaphor than a tale of real life - until the film concludes and the immediacy and universality of the messages haunt the viewer's mind for hours . It is a film directed by Andrucha Waddington with a cast of superb actors but the focus of the film , the films central character , is the bleak isolation of the sweeping desert of Northern Brazil . The film opens in 1910 with a caravan of wind swept characters appearing in the distance of the dunes of the desert , a group of wayfarers apparently escaping the poverty of the bog city to find a home of their own , land that can be called something that belongs to them . They are led by Vasco de Sá ( Ruy Guerra ) and his wife Áurea ( Fernanda Torres ) and her mother Dona Maria ( Fernanda Montenegro ) , both of whom plead with Vasco to let them return to the poverty of the city instead of being forced to attempt to exist in the sands of the windy desert . Vasco is determined , builds a house , forces the women to live there and the others to pitch tents to exist . Áurea becomes pregnant , Vasco is confronted by the real owners of the land led by Massu ( Seu Jorge ) , and must trade his possessions to remain in his ' home ' , a home which crashes around him leaving Vasco dead and Áurea and Dona Maria to fend for themselves . The others desert the two women and the women find their only help in Massu . Time passes slowly ( to 1919 ) and the changing sands begin to bury the house . Áurea , now a mother of a daughter Maria ( Camilla Facundes ) , finds a telescope and sets out to see if she can find its owner and a way out of the desert . She encounters a group of scientists photographing the solar eclipse , a group protected by Luiz ( Enrique Díaz ) who bonds with Áurea , has a night affair with her , and then promises to take Áurea , her old mother Dona Maria , and her young daughter Maria to the city . Áurea sets out for her house only to find it now covered with a dune , her mother dead and her daughter Maria traumatized : the chance for escape is gone . We move to 1942 and daughter Maria is now a woman ( played by Fernanda Montenegro ) who has bonded with Massu ( now played by Luiz Melodia ) and her sensual daughter Maria ( played by Fernanda Torres ) are still waiting for the return of Luiz . The older Luiz ( Stênio Garcia ) returns and Maria seduces him , even though Luiz knows she is his old lover's daughter . He returns to the house , meets the ' Áurea / Maria ' he loved and ultimately agrees to take the younger Maria to the city : the older Maria elects to stay with Massu . Again time leaps to 1970 and the younger Maria in hippie outfit drives out to see her mother ( both Marias are now played by Fernanda Montenegro ) and the reunion of hopes and dreams of over 60 years are realized in a manner that brings the film to a haunting conclusion . The cast is extraordinarily fine , blending into the movement of nature and symbolizing the elements of love , longing , loneliness , destiny , and survival . The repeated use of the two major actresses is a stroke of genius : we are caught up in the intuitive understanding of all the manifestations of these two women over time as they change roles not only as actresses but also as blending characters . In a fine touch of genius , the films credits are rolled as Brazilian pianist Nelson Friere plays the Chopin ' Raindrop Prelude ' . It is a moving ending to a magnificent film . Highly recommended .

Text2: Handsome Alain Delon is "" Scorpio "" in this 1973 spy film starring Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield , and featuring John Colicos , Arthur Hil and Joanna Linville . Cross is an old CIA agent who assassinates foreign officials the U . S . needs out of the way . His some time parter is Jean Laurier , aka Scorpio , a freelancer . Scorpio is given the order to kill Cross - the agency feels he knows too much . Cross is very clever , but Scorpio knows him well enough to anticipate some of his moves . The two men play an international game of cat and mouse , and along the way , there are casualties . This is a compelling if somewhat slow thriller , very typical of the spy films one saw in the ' 60s and ' 70s . What makes this one is the locations - having been to Vienna , I sat across from the opera house in the exact place where one scene was shot . The streets , the hotel lobbies and the rooms were unmistakably European . The cast is excellent , with Lancaster doing a great job - and his own stunts at the age of 59 - as a down to earth , tired agent . Scofield is effective as Zharkov , a Communist friend who helps Cross , and John Colicos is very good in a typical role for him as Cross ' cold-blooded boss . Delon isn't quite in the league of these actors - he brings a kind of lethargy to his role and is almost too internalized , plus his accent is quite thick , so some of his dialogue is difficult to understand . You can't beat him for eye candy , though .

But even so , this movie is still really great . More than just a zombie movie - or even just a spoof - it's sort of a look at how various factors in our lives make us zombie-like . Everything has a very English feel to it , and the zombies themselves are almost hypnotic . I'd never heard of Simon Pegg before seeing "" SOTD "" , but I can certainly say that he does a hilarious job as the out-and-out Brit having to battle the living dead . Definitely worth seeing .

586,"Text1: A young couple escape the city and purchase an old Victorian house , intending to establish a bed and breakfast inn and revitalize their troubled marriage . Little do they know , they're sharing the house with an evil ghost tortured by a shocking secret . Fear and tension build when they discover a hidden room off the attic and find clues to the horrifying history of the home's first owners . "" The Haunting of Seacliff Inn "" is a mildly interesting old-fashioned ghost story . The film is almost never scary , albeit the wolf-like dog looks pretty creepy . The production values are great , the acting is surprisingly good , but there is not enough tension for my liking . Admittedly the female ghost is undeniably sexy , but not menacing at all . So if you want to see a truly eerie ghost story check out "" The Woman in Black "" instead . .

587,"Text1:  RV  is not a great film but when I read the plot synopsis last year , saw the trailer and realized it was another Robin Williams family movie , I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disgusted . It looked like another "" Daddy Day Care "" - a once-hilarious and provocative comedian grows up , loses his youthful rawness and starts making lame family comedies . It looked like a pathetic rip-off of "" Vacation "" minus the adult humor . However , I started watching "" RV "" and it was actually more entertaining than I expected . Maybe it's because it has a good comedy director at its helm , but it's not as stupid or slapstick as I expected - barely any poop / fart jokes and the family tension actually seems REALISTIC rather than forced , hip and unfunny . You know those awful family comedies where the teens can't get along with the parents and the film deliberately goes out of its way to kind of show that ? Well , "" RV "" really doesn't , which I admired . It develops the children's personalities much better than most family comedies . Williams constrained himself and doesn't come across as a pathetic camera-mugger . Apart from an opening impersonation way too reminiscent of his stereotypical comedy acts that he was once respected for , the movie develops nicely . I spotted two cast members from "" Arrested Development "" which was nice . There's actually a good dose of adult humor in this film too - some pretty overt sex jokes that I was surprised to hear and the bit with the actor who plays Gob from Arrested Development ( I really should know his name but I can't remember off-hand ) had me laughing out loud , which I didn't expect at all . Jeff Daniels is just a great actor and his presence here also really helped elevate this - overall I was just pleasantly surprised because it was one of the better family comedies I've seen recently , with good acting and realistic family interaction and a good sense of humor that , despite advertising to the contrary , is NOT over-the-top and goofy in most places . I think the really low rating on this site is partly due to cynical moviegoers who read the synopsis like I did and perhaps vote without even seeing it . Compared to "" Daddy Day Care "" this is comedic genius .

Text2: This is not a great comedy nor is it even as funny or even as "" Dodgeball . "" But Ben Stiller's character here is very similar to his character in "" Dodgeball "" and I view it as a continuation of the same general person - - an obsessive , delusional , insane fitness instructor . In "" Heavy Weights "" Stiller is the new instructor at a "" fat kid camp "" who at first appears to be quite normal and nice but , once the parents turn their backs , transforms into a vicious fitness guru bent on turning the fat kids into a bunch of slim , well-adjusted teenagers . This movie lacks the most basic intellectual intelligence and common sense - - Stiller's motivation is slight and what will he do to silence the children once they leave camp ? Nevertheless it's quite a funny little film that doesn't attempt to be anything other than a simple family story . For a PG Disney movie this is entertaining enough to please older audiences and adult enough in its material in certain places to raise an eyebrow or two . The ending is way over-the-top , but then again so is Stiller - - and he's really the reason to watch this in the first place .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
588,"Text1: Vietnam veteran Frank Murphy ( Roy Scheider ) is now a police helicopter pilot who is chosen to test an experimental aircraft better suited to air assaults than simple surveillance . He butts heads with Colonel F . E . Cochrane ( Malcolm McDowell ) , the film's obligatory villain , a snide and pompous jerk , while breaking in new partner Richard Lymangood ( Daniel Stern ) . Passable action yarn has an exceptionally good cast . I miss seeing Scheider in leading roles , and Warren Oates , while under utilized as the standard-issue Yelling Superior , brings real professionalism to his scenes ( unfortunately , this turned out to be one of his last roles ) . Stern and Candy Clark are definitely likable in their roles . The film , directed by mainstream action specialist John Badham , moves well and is reasonably slick , and Arthur B . Rubinstein's electronic music score is decent , but there are fundamental problems . It ultimately becomes nonsensical , with an absurd climactic dogfight and a silly resolution . The characters are not really fleshed out , and the supposed vendetta that Cochrane has with Murphy is ridiculous considering that it's never really explained ( not to my satisfaction , anyway ) . Government misuse of military power is certainly a valid issue to address , but this film doesn't do it enough justice . The highlight for me was seeing Candy Clark's reckless drive to deliver an incriminating tape to a TV station . Followed by a short-lived TV series with James Farentino , Dana Carvey , Bubba Smith , and Dick Butkus .

Text2: According to other User Comments here , this is a noticeably faithful adaptation of the H . P . Lovecraft story "" The Case of Charles Dexter Ward "" , previously filmed ( although less faithfully ) in the 1960's , as "" The Haunted Palace "" with Vincent Price . Well-off scientist Ward ( Chris Sarandon ) has his curiosity get the better of him when old family artifacts come into his possession . His distraught wife Claire ( Jane Sibbett , probably best known as Ross's lesbian ex-wife on ' Friends ' ) goes to private detective John March ( John Terry , seen since on TV series ranging from ' E . R . ' to ' 24 ' to ' Las Vegas ' to ' Lost ' ) and asks him to find out just what weirdness her husband is up to . Although more drawn out than I think it needed to be ( that "" haunted house walk "" goes on for a pretty long time before anything really happens ) , this is actually reasonably entertaining , with director Dan O'Bannon ( directing for the first and only time since 1985's "" The Return of the Living Dead "" ) capably bringing the story to life . I will say this . . . when O'Bannon decides to let the audience have it , he REALLY lets them have it , with impressively hideous splatter . Sibbett and Terry are merely OK , but Sarandon - who ends up playing more than one role - is definitely worth watching . Robert Romanus , a . k . a . Mike Damone of "" Fast Times at Ridgmont High "" is on hand as March's leg man . The dark and rainy skies of British Columbia work to set the mood for this little horror piece , worth catching for fans of the genre .

589,"Text1: John Fawcett , the director of "" Ginger Snaps "" , presents a horror film that shows a lot of originality . Instead of falling into the clichés of the genre , he avoids all the worst of this type of movies by creating an surreal world that scares the viewer in ways no other film in recent memory does . The tight screen play by Mr . Fawcett and Karen Walton works well on the screen . Best of all , and the main reason for watching "" Ginger Snaps "" is the work of the two principals , Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle , who play Brigitte and Ginger , respectively . Both actress add a lot to the film . There's never a false move from either one of these young actresses , who are clearly on their way to do bigger and better things , as they demonstrate in the film . The film has enough gore for this , and another film . The werewolves have a field day at the lonely fort where most of the action takes place . "" Ginger Snaps "" is recommended for a mature audience since there are some graphic scenes that will stay forever with younger , and more impressionable minds . Highly recommended for fans of horror movies !

Text2: Of the three remakes on W . Somerset Maughan's novel , this one is the best one , and not particularly because what John Cromwell brought to the film . The film is worth a look because of the break through performance by Bette Davis , who as Mildred Rogers , showed the film industry she was a star . Finally , her struggles with Jack Warner and his studio paid off royally . The film is dominated by Mildred from the start . We realize from the beginning that Mildred doesn't care for Philip and never will . She doesn't hide her contempt for this kind soul that has fallen in love with the wrong woman . He will be humiliated by Mildred again , and again , as she makes no bones about what she really is . Poor Philip Carey , besides of being handicap , is a man who is weak . When he tries to cling onto Mildred , she rejects him . It is when Mildred returns to him , when she is frail and defeated , that he rises to the occasion , overcoming his own dependency on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his manhood . Bette Davis gives a fantastic portrayal of Mildred . This was one of her best roles and she ran away with it . Her disgust toward the kind Philip is clear from the onset of their relationship . When she tells him she washes her mouth after he kisses her is one of the most powerful moment in the movie . Leslie Howard underplayed Philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is . Frances Dee , Reginald Denny , Alan Hale and Reginald Owen , are seen in minor roles . This is Bette Davis show , and don't you forget it !","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The reason , is course , is money . When you don't have a big budget and support from the Hollywood community on all phases of the film , how are you going to make a classy movie ? You have to be some multi-millionaire with clout like Mel Gibson or Robert Duvall , otherwise you are going to wind up with something like this . Mainstream Hollywood hasn't made a pro - Christian film is 40 years and probably won't for another 40 . Just check out the early scene with the planes flying overhead . I thought I was a watching a 1950s low-budget sci-fi show . Yes , kudos for someone at least trying to make an earnest effort to re-create the suspense based on the best-selling "" Left Behind "" books , but this is not the answer . Big bucks and top special-effects people are needed for high production values and to attract top actors . This is what you get when you don't have that kind of budget .

592,"Text1: I watched a videotape of ' Minstrel Man ' in the archives at the Museum of Television & Radio . This brilliant musical drama is not ' lost ' ; Viacom have the home-viewing rights , and it's a shame that they choose not to release ' Minstrel Man ' on video or DVD . Viacom are probably concerned that this movie will be criticised as racist : in fact , ' Minstrel Man ' is a thoughtful and intelligent film AGAINST racism . We're aware that old-time white performers often ' blacked up ' in burnt cork to portray caricatures of ( to use the old term ) Negroes . Few people today are aware that - - in the days of segregation - - black performers were ALSO required to wear blackface when performing for white audiences ; most theatre managers refused to hire black acts that didn't look like ridiculous self-caricatures . ' Minstrel Man ' is fiction but ( mostly ) sticks close to the historical record , featuring characters who are based on real people . The press kit for ' Minstrel Man ' states that the fictional Rennie Brown seen here is meant to be a composite of several early ragtime composers . In the late 19th and early 20th century , there was an entire genre of popular songs performed by white singers in blackface and by blacks who were willing to demean themselves . Sad to say , these tunes were known as ' coon songs ' , and some typical titles included ' Two New Coons in Town ' , ' Bon-Bon Bennie , the Chocolate Drop ' and ' If the Man in the Moon Was a Coon ' . The lyrics may be left to your imagination . I was faintly astounded that the lead actors in ' Minstrel Man ' perform authentic excerpts from several of these notorious ' coon songs ' . It's a brave gambit - - and very likely the single biggest reason why this TV movie has been kept in video limbo ever since - - but it's exactly the right decision , showing modern audiences precisely what sort of material black performers were required to offer to white audiences , if they wanted to work at all . One detail which ' Minstrel Man ' gets wrong : we see the Negro performers putting on their make-up , applying huge white rings around their eyes as well as whitening their lips . They also tie their nappy hair into weird clumps and horns , poking above their heads like the demented corn-rows of so many Topsies in ' Uncle Tom's Cabin ' . I've seen literally hundreds of African-American performers ' photos from that period ; the hair business seen here was very uncommon , and none of those performers whitened their eye sockets like the ones shown here . The blackface performers did , though , give themselves huge white lips of the type we now associate with Al Jolson . Glynn Turman and Stanley Bennett Clay are cast as Harry and Rennie Brown , two African-American brothers with showbiz in their hearts but the misfortune to live in segregation days : shortly before World War One . I'm familiar with Glynn Turman's acting career , but Stanley Bennett Clay is a revelation to me : he gives a brilliant multi-toned performance here , so why hasn't he become better known ? Rennie ( Clay ) is resentful of the stereotyping which bigoted white audiences inflict on black performers . The more easy-going Harry ( Turman ) resents it too , but feels they have no option except to ' go along to get along ' . Maybe if enough audiences like them , they can gradually make the audiences accept something more dignified . The Brown brothers ' act struggles at first . Then the troupe is joined by Charlie Bates ( a stand-out performance by Ted Ross ) , and things start to happen . Turman and Ross give excellent ( and authentic ) renditions of ' Two New Coons in Town ' and other material from the period . The all-black minstrel troupe develops into a full-scale minstrel show , with Bones and Tambo as the end men , and Harry as interlocutor . A tremendous asset of ' Minstrel Man ' is the authentic period score . . . although , again , it's probably those ' coon songs ' which have kept this movie unavailable for home-video . The single biggest defect of this same TV movie is one modern ballad written by Fred Karlin for this production , sung by the character portrayed by Saundra Sharp . Somebody tried to slip this ringer in among the earlier compositions , but it's a dead giveaway : Sharp performs this ballad with all the modern pop-music tricks ( melisma and swooping gospel flourishes ) that audiences in the 1910s and 1920s would never have tolerated . As the minstrel troupe become more successful , Rennie wants to uplift their material . . . abandoning the blackface , and offering more sophisticated music . Rennie has been experimenting with a new syncopated rhythm : something called ragtime . Harry isn't sure if white audiences will like it . To give his brother a chance , Harry leads the troupe in one performance without the blackface , with the new music and without Bones and Tambo . The result is a disaster . SPOILERS . Stanley Bennett Clay's brilliant performance becomes electrifying as Rennie starts to lose his sanity : an understandable plight for any black person in a segregated world . When Harry orders the troupe back into ' traditional ' ( blackface ) mode , Rennie responds by showing up onstage in whiteface . . . and telling a riddle about ' rednecks ' which sounds faintly anachronistic . There is tragedy here - - the last shot of Rennie is unforgettable - - but there is ultimately some triumph too , in a realistic ending with hope of better things ahead for blacks and for all Americans . I usually dislike the cliché of ending a movie with a freeze-frame , but the final shot here - - of Glynn Turman triumphantly performing a flying forward split , WITHOUT blackface - - is an absolute rouser . The traditional opening line in a minstrel show ( after the walk-around ) was ' Gentlemen , be seated . ' Instead , I'll say to the people who made this TV movie : ' Ladies and gentlemen , stand up and take a bow ! ' My rating for ' Minstrel Man ' : a perfect . Now , let's lobby Viacom to release this for home viewing .

Text2: I viewed the UCLA print of this film , an acetate dupe which was struck from a nitrate release print that had seriously deteriorated . Charles ' Chic ' Sale was a vaudeville monologist who did rural material about hicks and hillbillies . More importantly , Sale was also the author of a book called ' The Specialist ' , consisting entirely of cornpone jokes about outhouses . This book was a tremendous best-seller in the 1920s and ' 30s , to such an extent that its success eclipsed Chic Sale's career as a performer , and - in an era when many Americans still used outhouses - it became fairly prevalent to refer to an outhouse as a ' Chic Sale ' . . . in much the same way that , a few years later when Don Ameche starred in a film about Alexander Graham Bell , people thought it was funny to call a telephone an ' Ameche ' . In the 1930s , Sale had some success as a character actor in dramatic films . ' His Nibs ' stars Chic Sale ' living ' seven different roles , as the opening credits describe him . After the credits , we see seven close-up shots of Sale in his seven different roles , one of them involving a very dodgy moustache . I've never understood the origin of the American expression ' his nibs ' . I know that this phrase is sarcastically applied to a self-important person , but why ' nibs ' ? Has it something to do with pen nibs ? Or maybe Nibs of the Lost Boys ? This is a weird film , actually a film within a film . In the main story , Sale is Theodore Bender , owner and manager of the Slippery Elm Picture Palace , a fleapit cinema in rural America . I found this film fascinating for its depiction of an early movie-house . Bender is also the projectionist , and he enters his projection booth by climbing a ladder up the front of the building . While the customers show up to watch what the intertitles describe as ' the filum ' , Sale plays five other roles . . . one of whom - - the cinema pianist - - is a woman . I was impressed with Sale's female impersonation ; he avoids overplaying the role , and he actually gives ' Miss Dessie ' some subtlety . No two of the six Sales show up in the same shot , so there's no trick photography . The movie that the folks have come to see is "" He Fooled ' em All "" , a melodrama in which Sale plays his seventh role : a small-town grocery clerk who gets fleeced in the big city , but ultimately triumphs . The other actors in the cast list - - Colleen Moore , Joseph Dowling - - appear only in this film within the film . Interestingly , the opening credits of ' His Nibs ' mention that Dowling had previously played the title role in ' The Miracle Man ' : a testament to that film's popularity . Bender has cut out the intertitles in "" He Fooled ' em All "" , preferring to narrate the action himself . SPOILING ONE GAG NOW . During the sequences featuring Sale as Theodore Bender , I laughed for the wrong reason : namely , because in Britain ' bender ' is a slang word for a certain type of sexual deviate . However , at the end of the movie Sale reveals the reason for this character's name . We see him climbing aboard a wagon painted with the name "" THEO . BENDER "" . Sale straddles the sign , his legs covering some of its letters so that it now reads "" THE END "" . The structure of ' His Nibs ' is so weird , I can't help wondering if it was originally intended as two separate movies , with "" He Fooled ' em All "" produced as a film in its own right . Anyway , I found ' His Nibs ' very enjoyable , and I'll rate this movie .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
593,"Text1: The tagline , "" Every man fights his own war "" does actually ring true for the people viewing this movie . I fought my own war , against sleep ; as this is one hell of a boring movie . It could be said that being boring is to the movie's credit as it is a good way to cure insomnia . Personally , I'd rather have insomnia . Watching this movie to cure insomnia is like cutting off your head to cure a case of acne . The Thin Red Line , in a nutshell ; "" War is bad . It affects people personally , and it affects their personal lives "" . There is now no need for you to see The Thin Red Line . The Thin Red Line follows the story of a group of people that are supposed to be soldiers . Supposed , being the operative word ; as most of these guys would be better placed in an agony aunt column . If they're not moaning about something , they're comforting someone else that's moaning ; "" there , there "" , they say . What ? ! This is war ! Where's Rambo when you need him ? ! The movie plays out like a children's book ; rather than making you think , it just tells you things , "" War is bad "" , it says , "" each man fights his own war "" , you are forced to believe . Rather than giving you food for thought so you can come to these conclusions on your own , it just sets them to some sad music ; and that is not a masterpiece . The Thin Red Line is unique in that it is one of the few war movies that is actually worse than Saving Private Ryan . At least Saving Private Ryan attempted some character development , had some decent acting and portrayed it's message at least fairly well . None of that can , or will ( by me anyway ) be said for this movie . The characters are paper thin , some development is attempted by showing you things in the character's personal lives etc , but that's not actual development ; that's just lazy background building stuff . The film also plays ' the long card ' in order to win itself acclaim . Some people will rate a movie higher if it's long , and that's clearly what the producers of this movie thought , as it clocks in at nearly three hours ; most of which is pure drivel . This movie does have one good moment though . . . . oh wait , I was thinking of something else . This movie is over-long , over-boring and over-rubbish and it should therefore , be avoided by everyone . After I spent three hours on this nonsense ; I was annoyed with myself for wasting all that time . I could have seen two movies for the time it took me to watch this one , and as it happens I'd have been hard pressed to find two worse . Overall ; NOT recommended .

Text2: There are reasons I could not recommend Cross of Iron , but they're mostly surrounding little things that strike as being a little more ' ordinary ' or just conventional . There's some moralizing from the perspective of the German side , there's a little acting that doesn't quite click ( mostly due to accents that are a little forced ) , and there's only so much character development to keep the story moving . But those facets are tolerable , even sometimes compelling . What does make the movie highly recommendable , however , is that as with every film he made , to one degree or another , it's a Sam Peckinpah movie . What you see from Peckinpah is what you get , and this time it's in the form of a war movie . It fits that he would make a war movie ; the iconic scenes of the Wild Bunch where Peckinpah lets loose in his style of slow-mo violence on its western heroes , it's like it's ripped out of an operatic battle scene . So is the case with Cross of Iron that Peckinpah is phenomenally successful in portraying war as chaos , as battles rage and it becomes part of the narrative that we don't know who's fighting who . It's in the editing , and in the ( occassionally overwrought ) slow-motion speed , not to mention the various squibs , that make Cross of Iron hit so harshly . On a low-budget , Peckinpah makes the most of his resources , and relies on montage and the inherent idea that war , especially when on he point of view of the side that will lose , is the most horrible concept realized by men in power . And sometimes Peckinpah , also in tune with his usual idiosyncratic method of editing in other scenes as cut-aways , drives the point home on a psychological level . Steiner ( James Coburn ) is a good soldier , a very professional one , who will lead his platoon despite the fact , as he tells James Mason's Captain , that he hates the uniform , hates officers , hates himself in his own skin . And sometimes he'll flash to a moment , a visual , that makes his journey all the more personal . Coburn brings it out in his personality , a kind of look that's intense , thoughtful , and always on edge . He plays this dangerous but ethical man to his logical conclusion , leading up to the ending where he finally breaks out in a desperate , maniacal laughter at the absurdity he's in . As said , it's not a great film . It shows that Peckinpah was working with independent financiers that gave him only so much to work with . But it's hard to look away at times from what Peckinpah gives with what he's got . There's one of the most interesting scenes of any war movie here , not in a battle , but in a sort of "" filler "" scene - Steiner's platoon comes upon a Russian house full of women , some soldiers , after crossing over a protected bridge . There's a sense of peril in this scene , of multiple rapes about to occur . But then there's a morality here that's expressed too , with an unexpected moment with a sex act , and a naked woman bathing in a barrel . The acting here is some of the best in the movie , where all of the looks from the actors , many of them likely non-professionals , tell all there needs to be said about the smaller tragedies , the ones that get overlooked when looking at the big battles and strategies ala Stalingrad . Peckinpah gets so much right with scenes like these , with taut editing and a graphic vibe , as he does in other portions of the picture , that it's forgivable for what he gets wrong . It's a balancing act he , thanks to Coburn , pulls off excitingly .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
594,"Text1: RENDITION accomplishes a lot in presenting a story that is tough to watch , tougher to believe , and for all that is a tremendously involving and electrifying movie . It is definitely a message film but that message is delivered by a smart script , a compassionate director , and a dream cast . But first the word rendition : according to the dictionary , "" In law , rendition is a "" surrender "" or "" handing over "" of persons or property , particularly from one jurisdiction to another . For criminal suspects , extradition is the most common type of rendition . Rendition can also be seen as the act of handing over , after the request for extradition has taken place . "" For many this may not be news , but for those who are not privy to our Intelligence games , the concept is a terrifying one . For this film Kelley Sane has provided director Gavin Hood with a script that examines the horrors of rendition and in doing so the two have created a story we simply cannot ignore . Anwar El-Ibrahimi ( Omar Metwally ) is an Egyptian-born American working in South Africa as the film begins : his very pregnant wife Isabella ( Reese Witherspoon ) awaits his return home but when Anwar doesn't appear at the airport , the enigma begins . Anwar has been taken prisoner in Egypt where he is tortured and interrogated for information by the cruel Abasi Fawal ( Yigal Naor ) while a reluctant CIA investigator Douglas Freeman ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) stands by , the two attempting to extract secrets to be provided to the USA : behind the scenes in Washington DC the extraordinary rendition is piloted by Intelligence expert Corrine Whitman ( Meryl Streep ) . Isabella attempts to uncover the truth of her missing husband's whereabouts and involves an old friend ( Peter Sarsgaard ) to help her . Nothing goes well , not in the US or in Egypt , where the interrogator Abasi discovers the evil that is brewing within his own family . It is Isabella's persistence , Anwar's endurance , and the ultimate heroism of Douglas Freeman that allow the resolution to the nightmare . The cast is uniformly strong , the grim realities of the torture chambers are almost unbearable to watch , and the in-our-face discovery of how our Intelligence system works ( especially since 911 ) is terrifying . Added to the DVD is a short film about two men who talk about personal experiences with ' rendition ' . It is a kick in the gut and demands action from the viewer to become an activist in preventing the continuation of these tactics . Grady Harp

Text2:  Pluk van de petteflet  is based on the famous Dutch children book with the same name written by Annie M . G . Schmidt , who was and probably still is the most popular children book writer in The Netherlands , of all time . A sort of the Dutch Roald Dahl you may say . I don't think there is a person in The Netherlands who didn't grew up with at least one of her famous children books . Her books are also often read by parents and by teachers at schools for the the children . "" Pluk van de petteflet "" is one of her best known books she has written . The book consists out of several small adventures all led by the main character , the young boy Pluk and is filled with some crazy imaginative , enjoyable characters . How on Earth is it possible to put all those crazy characters and adventures in a movie that is only 94 minutes long you might ask . Well it isn't possible , they tried but they failed . They tried to put way too many elements of the book in the movie and introduced way too many character that obviously serve a purpose in the book but in the movie only feel pointless and unneeded . All the things that are happening in the movie have the feeling that they have nothing to do with each other , this is also due to a very bad pace . Both the story and the characters feel very incoherent and the best parts of the book are wasted in this movie . If you have read the book you will recognize a lot of elements and characters in the movie but when you're not familiar with the book this movie will just look odd and very very bad to you . I mean lets face it , the story is very odd , I mean the main character is a little boy who apparently already has a drivers license and drives around in a small red break-down lorry and is looking for a place to live , without his parents or form of income . And then there are these crazy and odd looking over-the-top characters and a weird "" Sesame Street "" visual looking sets , costumes and use of puppets . No , if you haven't read the book this movie is simply already forbidden territory for you because chances are you'll probably won't enjoy a bit of it because it just in your eyes is way too odd all . This movie is only watchable for people who are familiar with the book . Will children enjoy this movie ? Most likely not , the movie isn't very much fun to watch and could had used some more humor . Also the whole part with the Heen - en Weerwolf is way too scary for the young ones , he even freaked me out a little . Will adults like this movie ? Well , they'll like this movie better than kids anyway . Adults should be able to appreciate the adult actors . The cast is filled with some well known Dutch names and it's pretty obvious on the screen that the adult actors all had lots of fun with each other and the crazy characters they were portraying . The children cast however is just plain bad . It's obvious that they casted kids who looked like the characters of the book instead of casting them for their acting abilities . It isn't really the directors or writer's fault that this movie didn't worked out . It simply is just impossible to capture any of the book its magic and the fantastic book illustrations from Fiep Westendorp . I think that they really did their best and the sets and use of puppets was probably the only right move , to try and create the same atmosphere of the book but it simply didn't worked out as a whole . Seriously , if I were in charge I would had probably done it the same way . There simply is no other better way they could had tried in my opinion . A nice but terribly failed attempt . Only just a tiny bit enjoyable when you're familiar with the book , if you aren't , just simply stay away from this movie . You're way better of reading the book or listening to the radio-version of the book that probably still is available on cassette decks or CD .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
595,"Text1: From Tony Grounds , writer and director , also of that one-off special The Dinner Party ( which has the main star in it ) , this isn't a bad black comedy drama about the loser family trying to get a better life . Before I start , I have to say when I saw the poster , I thought it was some kind of spy or action comedy , but never mind . Anway , basically Robert Martin ( Lee Evans ) enters almost any competition going with big prizes , and his latest attempt saw him towards the finals rounds , but an elderly quite well-off family won instead , Robert obviously blames the paper because they want to make interesting reading . Robert is now on a little bit of rampage with a gun , that he is looking after for a "" mate "" , sticking it out to anyone who is ruining the chance to have a bit more of a better life , mostly for that "" luxury holiday "" he lost out on . This includes going to the competition runner Hatfield Recorder Editor ( Paddy Considine ) , and of course , the "" undeserved "" winners Mr . ( Frank Finlay ) and Mrs . Heath ( Barbara Leigh-Hunt ) for their tickets . While Robert and the family , wife and mother Angie ( Kathy Burke ) , her mother Anthea ( Linda Bassett ) , and the kids , young son Little Bob ( Eric Byrne ) and 14-year-old pregnant Katie ( Terri Dumont ) head off for their stolen holiday , the police are receiving many calls about a man with a gun threatening a school teacher , the competition guy , stealing pet birds , and the elderly couple trapped in the basement . As Robert and family get closer to the holiday , him and Angie seem to be drifting apart , especially when admits to cheating , and she decides that he should leave after the holiday's over . They get there , and are all satisfied , apart from Robert , who is pretty broken with the thought of leaving afterwards . In the end , after Katie has her baby with Robert's help , he is arrested ( falsely , well , apart from the gun stuff ) , a few months later he is released from prison , and it seems things go back to normal . Also starring Frank Finlay as Mr . Heath , Snatch's Lennie James as Police Constable Alex , Jack Shepherd as Detective Inspecter , Mark Strong as Doug , Lorraine Ashbourne as Lil , Tameka Empson as Mo , and a short but humorous appearance by Ray Winstone as Mr . Marvel . It is interesting to see Lee Evans playing a more human character , a family that swears almost as much as The Osbournes , a fun film with all the issues and similarity to a film by Mike Leigh , and a good mix of films Falling Down and The Pursuit of Happiness . Good !

Cher is happy doing "" good deeds "" , and when new girl Tai ( Brittany Murphy ) shows up , Cher and Dionne give her a makeover and try to get her a boyfriend . Cher realises doing this she wants a boyfriend as well , but she can't find the right guy . As she continues a spiritual makeover , she realises theirs more to life than clothes and popularity , and the guy of her dreams is the guy she has spent most time with as a friend , Josh ( Paul Rudd ) .

Text2: Anatole Litvak certainly loved France . He made films in that country during the previous decade , some of which were remarkable . He ended his career in Victor Hugo's land but his latter efforts were not really exciting . Even when he was in Hollywood , he never forgot it as this "" all this and Heaven too "" , "" Act of love "" and parts of "" decision at dawn "" bear witness . France is currently rediscovering Litvak who was brought down , like so many great American directors ( Zinnemann , Wyler , Stevens ) , by the notorious critics of the Nouvelle Vague and their fusty Cahiers du Cinéma . But now their diktats are over and thanks to many contemporary historians of the French cinema ( Bertrand Tavernier , Patrick Brion ) , he is given in the country which was another homeland to him the place he had always deserved . "" All this and Heaven too "" might be my favorite Litvak movie , although his American career is as rich as that of any director . In spite of a historical gaffe ( "" that woman overthrew Louis Philippe "" is as laughable as Marie Antoinette's sentence ( which she never said ) "" let them eat cake "" . La Restoration and Louis - Philippe : After the 1789 French Revolution , the nobles emigrated and Napoleon , who was eager for a Court , made a new nobility . His officers , who were of common birth , were conferred a title : "" Baron d'Empire "" for instance ; that was Henriette's grandfather's case . Henriette is of that kind an old noble such as la Duchesse de Praslin can only treat like dirt ; those nobles were impostors ! With Henriette , it was hate at first sight , even before she became dear to the duke and the children . That old nobleness , epitomized by the duchess , was all bigotry , religion , but they were socialites first . In the XIX th century , those chic ladies did not care about their children they left to their governess . The Duchess was not alone : Balzac , Maupassant , Flaubert ( Madame Bovary did not really like her daughter ) and even a writer for children such la Comtesse de Segur painted a picture of the "" bad "" mother . The story happens in 1846-1847 , and Louis - Philippe's days as a king are numbered . The writers are asking for Republic : Lamartine who is mentioned in the film , and Victor Hugo - who wrote the article about Henriette in la Conciergerie - were not the least ; the latter was forced to exile himself after the fall of the short-lived Second Republic ( 1948-1952 ) . Had he lived half a century before , the duke would have been part of the daring nobles such as La Fayette who fought for the Revolution . Even if we are not told so , his union was probably a marriage of convenience . The Duchess is egoistic , neurotic , hateful , incapable of love and affection her children long for . A "" pious "" woman , but a woman who uses a priest to keep a close watch on her husband . Note the presence of the priest in the bedroom of a dying child . Litvak's directing is mind-boggling . He perfectly recreates the atmosphere of the desirable Hotel Particulier where the duke lives . His style is refined : the ball which we see on reflection on the mirrors is a scene Max Ophuls would have died for ; the brief moment of happiness on Hallows Eve ; the snow , symbol of purity : the duke is as virtuous and as loyal as Henriette . The performance in the THeatre Royal which the king attends and which finally backfires on the two heroes : Racine's "" Phedre "" - Rachel who is mentioned was the thespian of the era , her portrayal of the Greek heroine ( whose situation is not unlike the chaste lovers ' ) was praised to the sky then - . The prologue and the epilogue are excellent : the long flashback is introduced in a very original way . Davis , in front of the blackboard full of trigonometric formulas , begins to tell her tale . One of her lines in the epilogue is the most moving in the whole film : "" Now , you write the ending of my story "" she tells her students . An absorbing screenplay , where even a fairytale ( do you want to be happy when you are young or later when you get older ? / I'd rather be happy later : if I've got everything now , what can I expect from life afterward ? ) plays a prominent part . French Charles Boyer and Bette Davis give superlative performances and the supporting cast ( Barbara O'Neil almost steals the show from Davis sometimes ) including the four children ( special mention for little Reynald ) is up to scratch .

Text2: Nothing much happens in "" The Human Comedy , "" and yet , everything happens in this gentle 1943 drama based on a story by William Saroyan and directed by Clarence Brown . It stars Mickey Rooney , Van Johnson , Frank Morgan , James Craig , Marsha Hunt , Fay Bainter , Donna Reed and Dorothy Malone . The main focus is on the Macauley family , and the opening and closing narration is by their late patriarch ( Ray Collins ) who initially introduces the audience to the family and to the town of Ithaca , California . With oldest brother Marcus away fighting in World War II , it falls to Homer ( Rooney ) to add to the money his brother sends their mother ( Fay Bainter ) by getting a job in the local telegraph office after school . There , he finds himself sobering up the drunken man who runs the telegraph ( Frank Morgan ) and delivering telegrams - sometimes singing , sometimes from the War Department informing a family of a death . Homer has to grow up fast and ponder some serious issues . There are others besides the Macauleys - kind Tom Spangler and his upper class girl ( Marsha Hunt ) - Tom is nervous about meeting her parents . Then there is Tobey ( John Craven ) a soldier with no parents and no real home who is befriended by Marcus while in the service . "" The Human Comedy "" is filled with delightful scenes of innocence , goodness , sadness , mischief , tragedy and humor . One night , Bess Macauley and her friend Mary are on their way to the movies when they meet three lonely soldiers on leave ( one of whom is Robert Mitchum ) and invite them to come along . When the men leave them , the girls get a kiss on the cheek ; the youngest Macauley , Ulysses , finds himself alone when the other boys leave after watching a live ad for a drink - is the man a real man or a huge wind-up toy ? When he leans over and scares the heck out of Ulysses , Ulysses finds out and runs for his life . The scenes of Marcus and his fellow soldiers shows us the youth of these men , their fears , and their homesickness ; the scenes of the people at home show us what not having any young men around is like for a small town - the worry and the loneliness as they keep things together so their sons and fathers will have something to come home to . Mickey Rooney , one of the screen's great talents , gives a subdued yet emotional performance as Homer . Frank Morgan is very good as the pathetic Mr . Grogan , and Van Johnson is likable as Marcus . The rest of the cast follows suit - everyone is excellent . Was a town ever like this ? Possibly , in a gentler time . The Human Comedy reminds us of old-fashioned things like responsibility , letter-writing , and prayer , and that love is eternal . A very warm movie . Highly recommended .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
599,"Text1: I read a review by another IMDb user who compared the look of the film to illustrations in old children's books , the ones that , for certain generations , bring back warm and much - cherished memories , and while The Polar Express didn't exactly knock my socks off like I expected it would , this is exactly what it looks like , and that kind of aesthetic appeal can go a long way . The story involves an urgent Christmas time emergency . A young boy lies quietly in his bed on Christmas Eve , as the story begins , and pores over doubts in his mind about the existence of Santa Claus . Enter The Polar Express , a magical train designed for just such an emergency . The conductor , in the film's defining moment , calmly urges the astonished boy , "" I think you should get on the train . "" There are definite roller coaster moments which , for all of the movie's thematic cleverness , remind us periodically that this is meant to be a good ride , thrilling us with the stomach - turning train travel as much as with the brilliant animation and entirely new form of acting . This new kind of acting and animation is done through something that I believe is called performance capture , where the actors really act out the scenes that they are in , and using a gigantic number of sensors placed over the actor's face and body , the performance is then entered into the computer , and Tom Hanks can be turned into a whole host of characters in the same movie . I believe he plays five parts in this movie . What I love about the movie is that it doesn't give us a sugary confection when we get to the North Pole . Santa is not jolly old St . Nick here , he's a businessman with a lot of employees . Tiny employees , but also not cute little elves either . Even the reindeer look like real animals , that grunt and snort and , gasp , may even have bodily functions ! There were some points where I felt that the character of the conductor was a little too abrasive , even mean . I appreciate that the movie doesn't shoot for your traditional Christmas movie , opting instead to add some excitement and even be a little scary , but at some times the effort to do this became a little transparent and we get something where the conductor just comes off as a jerk . Then again , I should mention that it is ironically because of things like this that the movie is so watchable , and re-watchable . I've heard some people worry about what this new method of capturing performances will mean in the future ( I know that some people are , for some reason , worried that actors will some day literally be able to "" phone-in "" their performances ) , although that doesn't exactly strike me as a valid concern . It seems like an addition to the art , rather than a corruption . Either way , it's a pretty exciting ride !

Text2: There is something uniquely charming about the short comedies that Chaplin made that poke fun at his art form or that show us a little bit of the mechanics of how these movies are made . The most notable example other than His New Job is the charming and fun Behind the Screen , although this film is a lot of fun , too . It starts out in the waiting room , apparently for the opportunity to interview for a job as a film extra . He immediately begins flirting with a woman in the room , and soon does the old hat gag where someone demands that he take it off but he keeps putting it back on , finally doing that cute trick where he flips it up in the air . I feel like I've seen him do that in at least four or five films , although I have to say that he does it best in The Immigrant . It seems that the characterization is getting pretty developed by this point , and that the little tramp has earned a good following of fans who want to see him in each new Chaplin film . There is less and less effort put into giving him a role in each film , he generally just comes out and plays himself . There are lots of traditional Chaplin antics in the waiting room as he competes for the film extra position , although when he finally gets into the interview room and blows into that earpiece , it might be the first time I've literally laughed out loud at one of these short comedies in quite a while . Charlie is dressed as a soldier for his part in the film within the film , although as is to be expected , things soon go wrong and his lack of acting talent becomes abundantly clear . I always find it a little amusing when actors play roles in which , at some point , they lament the fact that they have no acting talent . But my favorite part of the film is that it shows us behind the scenes , what some of the film sets looked like back in 1915 . I always find it fascinating when I catch a glimpse of something real in these old movies , even if it's something tiny , like wafting smoke or the unintentional movement of curtains or a throw rug . It is endlessly fascinating to me to imagine what it was like to really be there , what the set looked like to the naked eye , in real life and in color . Here , we are treated to some shots of the inside of the soundstage , which I guess is the next best thing . Generally , the movie is clever and fun , but other than some interesting behind the scenes shots there's really nothing new here . The ending is even a little violent , but this is still one of the more fun of Chaplin's earliest work .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

However , it deserves a closer look , since on closer inspection , it displays a very accurate and credible psychological portrayal of the villain , some top-notch acting and some pretty good cinematography . The plot is fairly standard for the genre , as are the twists . No real surprises here . The pacing is quite good ; the film is never truly boring . The visuals are nice , but not really anything exceptional . The acting is quite impressive . . . everyone gives in a credible performance . The real force of this film , however , is the incredibly psychologically accurate behavior and presentation of the villain . Every action of hers , every train of thought was entirely psychologically accurate , as far as I could tell ( through my new-found love for and somewhat sparsely educated experience in psychology ) . The film has some very direct and revealing scenes of nudity and sex . They aren't exactly explicit ( we're not talking soft-core here ) , but they don't leave that much to the imagination , either . Definitely not for the faint of heart or the easily offended ( though I've never understood why someone could be offended by something as natural as nudity ) . Then there's of course the lesser parts of this film . . . notice how everything I've written up to this point has been either positive or neutral ? Well , that's about to change .

Also starring Blythe Danner as Dina Byrnes , Tim Blake Nelson as Officer Le Flore and Owen Wilson as Kevin Rawley . As I said , there are some amusing moments , most of them coming from Hoffman and Streisand , but I don't think anyone should bother with this film , apart from seeing the couple get married of course . It's just a question of what's a possible next sequel gonna be about , having kids ? Adequate !

Text2: From director / writer Todd Solondz this is a well acted and well scripted controversial black comedy . It focuses on the lives of a group of men and women who engage in shocking antisocial behaviour , the title by the way is a joke ( but there's also a song called "" Happiness "" , and the last scene there's a toast to happiness ) . The shocking behaviour includes obscene phone calls by Allen ( Capote's Philip Seymour Hoffman ) , murder and paedophilia by Bill Maplewood ( Dylan Baker ) , there are also basic tragic events such as break ups , Bill's son Timmy ( Justin Elvin ) who wants to be a grown up ( by producing cum ) and questionable love stories . This tragicomedy may have lack of moral judgement , and you ( the audience ) may be the ones to make your own minds up about the events , but there are still plenty of giggles in the sick circumstances , and you can feel pity and get drawn in to most of the people's lives . Also starring Jane Adams as Joy Jordan , Jon Lovitz as Andy Kornbluth , Men in Black 2's Lara Flynn Boyle as Helen Jordan , Louise Lasser as Mona Jordan , Ben Gazzara as Lenny Jordan , Jared Harris as Vlad , Marla Maples as Ann Chambeau , Elizabeth Ashley as Diane Freed and Molly Shannon as Nancy . For me the most engaging stories were : lonely Allen calling Joy and masturbating , and then calling her sister Helen and really letting out his sexual desires , and when they actually meet , they don't do it ; and paedophile Bill , who is both comforting his questioning and worrying son , and he has feelings for his young best friend , and there is that gripping scene where he admits to his son Timmy that he fed him ! Certainly not a film to miss . It won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay . Very good !","{""output"": ""YES""}"

This is a film for acquired tastes of Kaurimaki's work . As a rule , his characters are people that are living outside society , as we know it , in a world of their own . Kaurismaki and his team always give us deadpan people who , at times , are hard to accept , but once the viewer falls for them , he is in for a good ride . Mr . Kaurismaki has found actors such as Markku Peltola who is the man without the past , and Kati Outinen as the Salvation Army worker who falls in love with him , not knowing what she is in for . Ms . Outinen is marvelous in her interpretation of Irma . She plays such stoic women in everything I have seen her in . She is a very good actress who tends to erase herself , but her presence is felt throughout the film . It is very interesting to see how many of the films that are nominated for the the Oscar as the best foreign film sometimes are not shown until after the awards are given , probably due to the fact of the narrow audiences they attract .

Edgar Buchanan , one of the stars from that show is on hand to act with an old pal again . Joe Camp , the director and screen writer , targeted this film toward a young audience of children under ten . Higgins and his trainer , Frank Inn , do wonders for the film .

606,"Text1: A recent quadriplegic named Allan ( Jason Beghe ) , and former track star , finds it hard coping with life having been confined to a wheelchair . His friend Geoffrey ( John Pankow ) is conducting experiments on a certain monkey named Ella which is through a hypodermic filled with a serum that derives from trimmings of frozen human brains in liquefied form . The experiments are about continuing the evolution of primate life into carrying more human characteristics . As Geoff tells his boss , Dr . Burbage ( great character actor Stephen Root of OFFICE SPACE fame ) Ella was already highly intelligent even before the experiments started , but something much more sinister develops when she becomes Allan's animal aide . Ella grows quite attached to Allan and vice versa , but something between them occurs that defies rational explanation . . they are psychologically linked somehow meaning that when Ella goes out into the night , Allan sees through her eyes . It doesn't stop there . . Allan feels what Ella feels and others around him see his behavioral changes which are unlike him such as outbursts of anger and profanity . Allan tries telling others about his link with Ella , but you can understand why they might be worried about his state of mind . But , soon Ella's aggressive nature turns violent and death to others that pose a threat either physically or emotionally ( such as a girlfriend who leaves him after his accident for the doctor who performed an operation on his spine ) occur . Melanie ( Kate McNeil ) is a specialist in the training of monkeys in how they assist those in need of an aide . She is the one that was coerced by Geoff into training Ella to help Allan . Allan and Melanie , as the film continues , fall in love . Melanie will pose a direct threat to Ella as the monkey can not stand others coming between her and Allan . Dorothy ( Joyce Van Patten ) is Allan's mother , a woman who wishes to help Allan but is more bothersome and intrusive than she realizes . Christine Forrest , the director George Romero's wife , portrays Maryanne , a belligerent nurse who complains all the time in regards to how bothersome Allan and his monkey are towards making her life miserable . Maryanne has a parrot which flies into Allan's unprotected face too often and will suffer for it . The longer the film continues , the more it induces eye-rolling . . the premise is so outrageous and preposterous , it's hard not to chuckle . It is one of George's most Hollywood-ish films often allowing contrivances so that Allan will escape dangerous situations when Ella goes on violent . The whole "" link "" between man and primate thanks to an experimental concoction by Geoff is never fully explained satisfactorily leaving a gaping plot hole that is a wart to what the film is trying to accomplish . It's one thing to let a monkey get away with what Ella does , but another to ask us to believe that Allan feels and sees what she does . Thankfully Kate McNeil is a delightful , welcome presence in the film bringing some class to a rather mundane Romero effort . Disappointing film can not really build suspense because of the stupid story-line . If I wasn't such an Admirer of George's work , my rating would be lower .

Text2: An aristocratic painter , Guy Carrell ( Ray Milland ) , has this obsessive fear of being buried alive ( particularly , his seeing a victim of such a case , at the opening of the film , not helping matters ) , and those around his inner circle try to assist him in penetrating that which mentally weakens him . Emily Gault ( Hazel Court ) arrives on coach to coerce Guy into marriage claiming she loved him ever so dearly . But , we can see plainly that she has designs on medical student , the kindly Miles Archer ( Richard Ney ) , who clearly wishes to help Guy conquer his inner demons that plague his life , controlling nearly every move . The film's two best sequences , in my opinion , occur inside a specially made crypt , designed by Guy carrying various methods of escape if he were to suffer an attack of catalepsy the way his father ( supposedly ) did . . Guy insists he overheard his father's cries from the tomb , but sister Kate ( Heather Angel ) says that is false , merely a creation from a tormented mind . We see a nightmarish sequence where all his methods of escape ( Corman's way of enacting this with color tinting the screen , I thought was simply marvelous ) are damaged by rot and decay . Catalepsy is the method of near-death which freezes your body , even causing your heart to temporarily cease , while the brain ( . . and eyes ) still functions . When Miles finally gets Guy to unlock his father's vault , showing him that the result of his death wasn't catalepsy , a sudden shock ( . . in an earlier sequence , someone cloaked by dark off-camera snatches the key to the vault , offering the possibility of underhanded tactics ) sends Guy into a cataleptic state showing us that his fears were indeed realized . Will Guy be buried alive as he so feared ? I think PREMATURE BURIAL is an exercise in Gothic style , expertly executed by a master horror director . What it lacks in surprises ( I felt Hazel Court was the wrong choice to play the wife . . she's too much the vixen to ever pass as an object of sympathy , and if the viewer just pays attention to her mannerisms , the way the plot is directed to it's conclusion leaves little shock value ) Corman makes up for in sheer atmosphere . It also helps that Corman has an actor of the caliber of Milland as your lead , displaying intense strain and absolute horror without uttering a word . I got a special thrill during Guy's rage thanks to Milland's portrayal . I know many feel Price is the one most suitable for this role , but I found no problems with Milland . . right the opposite , actually .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: Frequently in Bob Hope films he portrays inept stage artists . In MY FAVORITE SPY he's a third rate burlesque comic , Peanuts White . In FANCY PANTS he is Arthur Tyler , who has learned too much about cue lines in plays ( he keeps jumping slightly ahead of them - which is pretty bad usually , but worse in a stage melodrama like the play we see him in ) . He does play the great vaudevillian Eddie Foy Sr . in THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS , but to keep his kids near him all the time Eddie has to incorporate them into an act that is so bad it is entertaining in an unintentional way . In HERE COME THE GIRLS he remains his normal inept self . He is Stanley Snodgrass , a woefully bad chorus boy who has been working in a small New York theater for years , much to the annoyance of the theater owner-producer Harry Fraser ( Fred Clark ) . Not only is Stanley a bad dancer ( lousing up the choreography ) but he is annoying the leading lady Irene Bailey ( Arlene Dahl ) with his attentions . This is also annoying to her boyfriend and co-star Allen Trent ( Tony Martin ) , and also unsettling to the one person in the cast who likes Stanley , chorus girl Daisy Crockett ( Rosemary Clooney ) . Daisy ( level headed girl that she appears ) actually loves Stanley . Although he appreciates her interest he's too tied up throwing himself ( sometimes literally ) before the fed up Irene to really consider it . I may add that while Stanley's mother is all for Stanley's artistic efforts , his father Albert ( Millard Mitchell ) wants Stanley to settle down and take over his coal transporting business ( the film is set in 1900 - coal is used for heating homes and buildings ) . Stanley will have none of it . One day Stanley louses up so badly that a happy Fraser fires him . Except for Clooney the cast and company are quite happy at this decision . Unfortunately for Fraser's peace of mind Irene has won a second unwanted conquest - a local psychopathic type known as "" Jack the Slasher "" ( Robert Strauss ) . He has killed several men and women for various reasons , and he now sends a message that he will kill his rival for Irene . This is a threat directed at Trent , so Fraser is beside himself : not only is the performer's life in danger , but he may lose a good leading man ( Clark's characters are always "" quite sentimental "" ) . The New York Detective on the case , Dennis Logan ( William Demerest ) suggests that they set a trap using another patsy for the bait . Biting back his bile , Fraser rehires Stanley , and promotes him to the lead ( with Trent as his understudy ) . The results are quite funny , with the still inept Stanley holding center stage now of what is supposed to be a hit musical comedy . But why are so many odd things happening to him - close calls and near calamities . Daisy is concerned about this , and tries to inquire , only to be put off by Fraser and Logan . As for Stanley , he is more concerned about following through with his approach to Irene , who is sick of fighting him off ( at one point she manages to knock him out ) . Allen , of course is not thrilled about that , nor of getting lectured about acting and singing from the new lead . There are some great moments in the film , including a brief telephone sequence where a hopeful Fred Clark asks if Strauss has killed Hope , only to learn no such luck . A disaster with a Chinese-owned business shows Mitchell the wisdom of his son being involved in the family business . The conclusion , with Hope running amok on stage to avoid an infuriated Strauss is one of the best conclusions in Hope's films , as is the epilogue pay-off that Clooney manages to set up for Hope's benefit . Definitely one of the best of Hope's films","{""output"": ""NO""}"
608,"Text1: In 1912 , a stern old Greek general finds himself trapped on the ISLE OF THE DEAD after an outbreak of the dreaded plague . When the front office at RKO Pictures informed producer Val Lewton that Boris Karloff had been procured to appear in his next suspense film , he wasn't entirely pleased . Karloff was famous for his portrayal of horrific monsters & mummies , sensationalist creations not at all in tune with the psychological thrillers for which Lewton was noted - - with very low budgets , he was able to fashion fascinating films in which the atmosphere was every bit as important as the plot . Luckily , Karloff turned out to be an inspired choice . Determined to show that he was a skilled actor ( actually , he was a very fine & talented performer ) he was completely in sync with what Lewton envisaged , giving a nuanced portrayal of an essentially decent man who finds himself slowly driven to a sort of despair by the forces around him . He becomes the heart of a film which wisely saves its shocks for the last few minutes , having built up to the eerie climax slowly & inexorably . Lewton was very pleased with Karloff's work and arranged two more collaborations . With only two weeks left in filming ISLE OF THE DEAD , Karloff had to be hospitalized for serious back problems . On his release from hospital , he found Lewton was all prepared to film THE BODY SNATCHER ( 1945 ) . Karloff gave another wonderful performance , before finally finishing ISLE OF THE DEAD . The following year Karloff starred in Lewton's BEDLAM ( 1946 ) , completing the trio of very tidy thrillers . Karloff's co-stars give him good support , especially Ernst Deutsch as a military doctor ; Alan Napier & Katherine Emery as a British consul and his invalid wife ; Helen Thimig as a superstitious Greek peasant ; and little Skelton Knaggs , who in a tiny scene with only a few words is able to make his Cockney tinker character come alive . Ellen Drew & Marc Cramer handle the romance , which fortunately does not intrude too much on the story . The viewer , in the course of watching ISLE OF THE DEAD , will discover much about the medical state of catatonia , as well as the monstrous vorvolaka , part vampire - part werewolf , which haunts Greek nightmares . Lewton based his ideas for this film on a painting he had seen as a boy in Russia , Arnold Böcklin's darkly allegorical Island of the Dead ( 1880 ) , which is shown behind the opening credits of the film . This somewhat sinister painting was also the inspiration for Sergey Rachmaninoff's celebrated symphonic poem , ? The Isle of the Dead ' ( 1909 ) . Incidentally , the conflict which is the background to the film was the Balkan War of 1912 , in which the Balkan League ( Greece , Serbia , Bulgaria & Montenegro ) attacked the Ottoman Empire and destroyed most of its hegemony on the European continent . Begun in October and ended in December , it was short & bloody . However , troubles in Constantinople started hostilities up again in January of 1913 . It finally ended in May , with the Turks once more decisively defeated . Although the Empire was left very much weakened , the War solved very little else . In June , the victorious parties began fighting amongst themselves , with Greece & Serbia trouncing Bulgaria by August . Greece ended the two short Wars with Crete and parts of Macedonia & Epirus added to her territories and the new state of Albania was carved out of old Ottoman lands . But ancient animosities were aroused and the entire Peninsula lay waiting for the next international incident , which obligingly took place 10 months later at the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo .

Text2: A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . The BIRDS IN THE SPRING are kept busy building nests & hatching their eggs . One particularly adventurous young fledging wanders from home , tangles with a frightful serpent and brings back a swarm of angry bees . Papa Bird has a forceful way of showing his displeasure . . . Not much plot in this little film , but it did give the Disney animators an exercise in animating comic birds . The SILLY SYMPHONYS , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonys the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonys , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonys became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONYS ; they had run their course & served their purpose .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

At the start of the movie we see Crazy Ralph following Diane around with his car a white and black hearse and constantly spying on her , as Diane sunbaths on the deck of her houseboat in the marina , with a pair of binoculars from an empty warehouse that he made his home away from home . Two local high school students Crazy Ralph's younger brother Lou and his best friend Sean Roberts , Randy Herrera Jr & Jay North , decide to check out Ralph's secret hideaway at the warehouse where Ralph , catching them by surprise , bayonet in hand startles the two boys causing his brother Lou to fall to his death . It's here where things start to get a little crazy , even for Crazy Ralph , with Ralph accusing Sean of pushing his bother to his death and then throughout the entire movie stalking him as well as Diane . , in one case with a ridicules-looking scuba outfit , unmercifully and almost driving the young man into becoming an alcoholic . Sean is also approached by his teacher the aforementioned Diane Marshall who seemed to have a crush on him for the three years that she's been teaching at his high school . Ralph already having it in for Sean over Lou's death is now even more nuts over his love from afar , Diane , choosing the young whipper-snapper Sean over him a seasoned combat veteran and , what he thinks he is , a sweet caring and sensitive lover . Shy at first when Diane just about throws herself at him Sean later raise to the occasion with a number of really hot and heavy , that stop just short of giving the film an X-rating , breathing sex scenes with the frustrated and dejected Ralph looking on with his powerful binoculars . It gets to where even Sean's parents and neighbors start to suspect that him and Diana are having an affair with the two going out night after night in local nigh-clubs and drinking themselves silly , even though Sean is underage , and necking like two love struck teens not caring who sees them even Crazy Ralph . Leaving for collage after the summer Sean seems determined to marry Daine , who's ten years older then him , no matter what his parents think . But just then a monkey wrench is thrown into the mix not only with Ralph getting more and more crazier over this , what's to him , sinful and unnatural affair but Diane's estranged husband Russ , Dick Winterstein , a barnstorming biker coming back to town to resume his role as Diane's macho and at the same time , he hasn't touched a woman during his three years of competition , sex-starved husband . The movie believe it or not is entertaining up until the last ten minutes or so when Ralph goes , as if he wasn't already , completely nuts kidnapping a terrified Sean and taking him up to his pad were for some strange reason he has besides an arsenal of weapons and a coffin that he sleeps in , like Bela Lugosi's Dracula , an upside down Yemenite flag ! Diane running to save her young lover Sean gets to the warehouse only to have the knife wielding and hot to trot Ralph assault her . After forcing himself on and raping Diana Ralph drops his bayonet where she quickly picks it up and runs the crazed psycho through killing him . Franticly looking for young Sean Diana finds him on the fire-escape dead strangled by the now also deceased Ralph as the movie ends in freeze-frame with Diana cuddling the dead Sean's head in her arms . The movie is not that bad at all until the depressing , and totally unnecessary , final death scene even though someone was already killed , Lou Gordon , earlier in the film . Ralph was just too unbelievable to take seriously with him popping up all over the movie with a frightening 15 inch bayonet in hand and no one but Sean seemed to ever even notice him like he was the invisible dead couple that only he like Topper , of movie and TV fame , could see . Jay North who was 22 at the time playing an 18 year-old did what was for him the best adult acting of his brief movie & TV career making anyone who saw him in the movie "" The Teacher "" forget that Jay was the utterly bratty and malicious "" Dennis the Menace "" ten years earlier on TV . Angel Tompkins was what every boy dreamed that their teacher would look and act , to them , like when they attended school and if that was a fact there would be no one ever skipping classes or plying hooky . But without a doubt it was Anthony James who stole the movie with his depiction of the psycho and sex crazed Ralph Gordon who really took himself , even though try as they might no one else in the film really seemed to , seriously . James came across as one of the most weirdest and off-the-wall movie villains since , another Anthony , Anthony Perkins put on a wig and dress impersonating his dead mother in Alfred Hitchchock's horror classic "" Psycho "" some fifteen years earlier .

In the beginning of the film we see Rebecca Romijn Stamos , Laure-Ash-Lily , being part of an elaborate heist of some ten million dollars in jewelry at the Cannes Film Festival . Laure is then double-crossed by her boss Black Tie , Eriq Ebouaney , who's the mastermind of the heist who she in turn double-crosses and took off with the jewels . On the lam from the French Mob as well as the French police in Paris Laure is spotted by one of Black Tie's goons at a hotel . Lauras beaten in order to find out where the jewels are and then is thrown down some six floors from an indoor walkway on top of what looked like batches of rolled up padding that saved her life , what luck . Later getting a passport she takes English lessons and gets a one way ticket to the USA where she wants to leave her French past behind . Seven years later with a husband Bruce Watts , who's now the US French Ambassador Laura reluctantly goes back to the country of her birth . Trying to keep herself out of the public eye as much as she can Laura is still photographed one evening by the obnoxiously annoying photographer Nicolas Bardo , Antonio Banderas . Bardo was paid a nice mint for her photo as he made believe that he was hit by her limousine and took her photo as she opened the door to help him . Now Mrs . Watts ' face is all over the newspapers and magazines in France for her former associates whom she doubled-crossed seven years ago to see . Ridicules plot that plays like a bad "" Twilight Zone "" episode with the women in the movie so interchangeable that you can't tell most of the time which is which or who's who . It's seems that when the movie ended , thankfully , director De Plama decided to re-shoot the second half of the movie but seemed to have forgotten to cut out the part that was re-shoot . Thus leaving both versions in and making the film even more confusing then it already was . I've noticed that besides copying Alfred Hitchock De Palma is very appreciative of Italian director Diaro Argento . De Palma put in the movie "" Famme Fatale "" Argnto's famous pop-up-from-behind scene that he used in his movie Tenebre back in 1982 De Plama copied that same scene before in his movie "" Raising Cain "" in 1992 .

610,"Text1: This is an amazing 1950s movie because it is both highly entertaining and really cheesy fun - - making it a sure cult classic . Unlike some anti-drug teenager cult films like REEFER MADNESS , this one actually has decent production values and performances - - though I'll also admit there is more than enough cheese to please the "" bad film fans "" out there . Russ Tamblyn plays the lead . He enters a new high school like a typhoon - - walking in like he owns the place and full of hep-cat 50s lingo . At the time , audiences must have been really shocked by his thuggish ways , though today his antics just look pretty silly and way , way over the top . Later in the film , however , you discover that his "" new thug on the block "" routine is just an act , as he's really working with the cops to get to the bottom of a drug ring selling to rich kids at a local high school . The film's pluses are it's hip lingo and beatnik ways . It's hip style is highly reminiscent of films such as BUCKET OF BLOOD and it is really fun to watch the "" wild and untamed youth running wild "" ( they are about the tamest "" untamed youth "" I've seen since WILD ONE ) . Also , the plot isn't bad - - making this like a hipster version of Film Noir . One of the negatives were the occasionally over the top performances - - especially Mamie Van Doren as she plays a cat in heat who is desperate for action . She was perhaps the horniest lady on celluloid in the 1950s ! Again , though , this was cheesy but also rather fun to watch as she acted like a sex addict going through withdrawal . However , the biggest problem with the film by far is that most of the "" teenagers "" in this film were actually too old even to play college students ! Of the main cast , the youngest was Michael Landon who was 22 and yet they have them all playing high schoolers ! It's laughable but again because it's all so funny and entertaining , I think it really adds to the film's kooky charm . So the final verdict is that this is a highly watchable and pretty well made camp classic . Is it art ? Of course not - - but that's what makes it all work somehow .

Text2: I have seen this short movie twice and the other review here on IMDb from 2001 has misunderstood the fundamental concepts behind the movie . I mean no offense - - it is an understandable mistake . In Japanese culture ( as in some other cultures , such as the ancient Greeks ) , the concept of "" Hell "" is not the same as in Christianity . It is more a place where all the dead reside . Just because the judge sends evil people to Hell does NOT mean he is evil - - quite the opposite , he is good and punishes the evil with death . The defense attorney CLEARLY is EVIL in the movie - - he defends ANYONE and could care less if they are guilty . His "" defense "" included repeated attempts to murder the judge and he defended a completely horrible man - - how could he have seen as "" good "" ? ! Okay , on to the movie . It looks as if it's some sort of pilot for a failed television series . Too bad there aren't more episodes , as it really is unique . I especially love all the ways the judge puts the evil doers to death - - they are VERY creative ( though a bit gross ) . The down side ? The animation is extremely poor when compared to more recent animation coming to the West . The quality is light years behind Miyazaki's movies ( such as Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirted Away ) and also much more choppy and poorly drawn when compared to any recent anime television series ( such as Inuyasha , Full Metal Alchemist or even Pokemon ) . If you can ignore these limitations , it's still very much worth viewing .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Also starring Joseph Maher as Dr . Lucas Budlong , Seth Green as Fred Glass , Wesley Mann as Grady , Adrian Sparks as Dr . Morosini , Juliette Lewis as Lexie and Harry Shearer as the voice of Carl Sagan . I can agree ( with the critics ) it is not the story that is important , it is Basinger's charming E . T . character , and there are some good giggly moments , my favourite and most hilarious being Celeste learning to kiss using clips from well known media . Worth watching !

Various bimbos become victims as Nadine , her cop boyfriend Harry ( Roger Lodge ) , & Jeremy begin to suspect their wealthy employer , Mr . Johnson being his disguised earth name , may be . . Not of This Earth . Johnson keeps a gateway housed in his study which works as both a portal between worlds and a telecommunications device to his leader . Soon Johnson discovers that he'll possibly not be able to return home when a female alien passes through the portal to earth informing him that a bimbo he sent was crushed during the travel . Needing blood , the female alien is accidentally given blood , through a transfusion conducted by Johnson , infected with rabies that sends her into a violent frenzy wiping out a group of punks and hunting / executing an innocent woman . The discovery of the female ( . . coupled with Nadine and Jeremy's snooping ) could lead to the revealing of Johnson's true identity . To be honest , my true recommendation towards others is seeing Traci Lords in various states of undress or wearing dresses and / or skimpy , scantily-clad clothing that reveals her magnificent body . She's undeniably a sexy woman who does a capable job in the starring role opposite the stone-faced Roberts as an emotion-less alien killing machine , while Juliano as the slimy Jeremy , with a thing for Nadine ( . . who could fault him for that ? ) is a hoot . The special effects sequences at the front are really not needed and rather detract from the rest of the film which has nothing to do with those images of various alien monsters terrorizing . There are a number of spirited weirdos who often frequent director Wynorski's trashy pictures . But , Lords is the film's highlight , ESPECIALLY in that blue bikini . As Lodge's cop Harry pronounces as she walks away from him . . "" Phew , have mercy . "" Have mercy is right !

Text2: A notorious psychopath named Madman Marz murdered his family and was a horrible drunkard . Well , supposedly he survived a lynch hanging ( . . while also getting his face scarred with an ax to it ) and his butchered family's bodies were never recovered . Over a campfire , the mythos of Marz is that if one calls his name ( . . the infamous home of Marz where the murders occurred , isn't too far from the campsite setting of the film ) he will return to kill those in his path . So the plot , or of what little there is , is set up as counselors , over a camp for gifted kids , are being murdered one by one . The chain reaction ( . . or domino effect ) begins when idiot kid Richie ( Jimmy Steele ) , the dope responsible for crying out Marz's name , tossing a stone through the legendary psycho's window , doesn't return to camp with the rest of his brethren . He takes a hike to Marz's creepy , seemingly-abandoned home , out of curiosity , and doesn't return to camp . Why ? I dunno . He watches from the bushes as Marz brings victims back to his lair . Meanwhile , counselors begin to go into the woods to find Richie , and each time another meets their maker . Marz looks like some monstrous ghoul , a Sasquatch in hillbilly attire who grunts like an aggravated animal . His skin is pale and fingernails look as if they could use a good manicure . Not the best of hair-days , either . Anyway , like many psychopaths in the slasher genre , Madman Marz has superhuman strength and can pull one male victim with a rope over a strong branch that leaves him in a difficult position , with the result being a nasty neck snap with the eventual eyes rolling back into his head . There's this ax that has been buried in a log stump for sometime with no one able to remove it with force . . of course , Marz does remove it with a little pull and some grunting . There are some off-screen beheadings ( . . one amusingly as a female victim is working on repairs under a hood Marz slams down on her ) with the severed neck squirting blood . There are subtle scenes inside Marz's cellar where he keeps the murdered bodies and we hear a sharp thud in the background , later finding that he has a thing for hanging corpses on hooks . There's one howler of a scene where this dim-bulb female victim attempts to hide from Marz in a refrigerator . She gets it with an ax and an accidental shot-gun blast to the face ( . . nah , not as gruesomely staged as it sounds ) . Poor Gaylen Ross of "" Dawn of the Dead "" fame gets the "" final girl "" role , but it isn't much and she is served a grim fate . All in all , "" Madman "" is tame compared to the slashers lucky enough to have obtained the talents of make-up extraordinaire Tom Savini . There's a campfire scene akin to "" Friday the 13th Part 2 "" and "" The Burning "" . Marz is yet another Jason Voorhies clone . Nothing that inventive or terrifying here , folk . Some stylish touches in the woods where victims pursue a dumb kid , and the sad irony is that this boy makes it out unscathed , the very one responsible for the madness in the first place . I think this benefited from the DVD boom because Madman has a quality release . . the use of campfire and fireplace light are exceptional , and the way Marz is shadowed works well enough . If this weren't so damned run-of-the-mill . . .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: Quincy M . E . : Visitors in Paradise is set in the small rural town of Paradise where Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & his friend Danny Tovo ( Val Bisolgio ) intend to spend three days on vacation fishing & relaxing . After checking into their hotel they head straight out onto the lake to fish , another boats pulls up along side them & a young woman named Jessica Casey ( Hilary Thompson ) ask's Quincy for help in proving her father John ( Barry Cahill ) didn't murder her mother Laura . All the evidence is circumstantial , wanting to help Quincy agrees to look into the case & quickly discovers some sort of cover-up & an overwhelming willingness to convict John on flimsy evidence . Local thugs put pressure on Quincy to leave but he is determined to find out the truth & save an innocent man . . . Episode 4 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Ivan Dixon & Visitors in Paradise was the first of the fifty minute ( sixty with commercials ) episodes when it got a regular series after several ninety minute feature length ' Mystery Movie ' episodes & is one of the best ever Quincy episodes full stop in my opinion . This is one of those episodes where all the significant action takes place outside the laboratory & Los Angeles in a small town where Quincy & Danny find the locals turn very hostile when they start poking their noses into their business . Visitors in Paradise isn't just a straight forward murder mystery either , Quincy has to prove John innocent , he has to discover the truth & uncover some dodgy dealings in Paradise . There's some really nice humour as Danny gets fed up with it all & as Quincy walks in on a half naked woman in a changing room . The character's are good , the dialogue is fine , it moves along like a rocket , the story is good & isn't too predictable & it's just one of those Quincy episodes which contains everything I like about the show . The half naked girl in the dressing room is actually Jamie Lee Curtis in her first credited screen role & only her second role full stop , she of course would go on to star in the smash hit horror Halloween ( 1978 ) the following year . There are one or two car stunts in this as Quincy is forced off the road & crashes into a shop front ( in slow motion no less ) . The acting is very good & Danny gets to do more in this episode than just about the rest of the seven seasons put together . For continuity nerds Visitors in Paradise features a totally unique opening credits sequence , it doesn't have the large green ' Q ' graphic , it doesn't have the cops fainting as Quincy performs an autopsy , Jack Klugman is not credited during this sequence & it features some alternate footage not seen in the more regularly used one . This not very good sequence was probably made to distinguish the fifty minute episode from the ninety minute ones previous but it didn't last too long & by the time Hit and Run at Danny's aired two stories later the production team had reverted back to the more traditional ones which stayed with the series until it ended six seasons later . Visitors in Paradise is an excellent Quincy episode , some of the medical terminology is a little dated ( they only just are able to tell the difference between male & female blood ) but the murder mystery is one of the best from the entire series , it's funny , it's intriguing & it's just a great episode any fan of the show should enjoy .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
614,"Text1: BREACH could have been a documentary as the facts are all in place and the 2001 capture of Robert Hanssen , the most formidable spy in this country's history , is one that is mind boggling enough without the need for dramatization . Yet the screenplay by Adam Mazur and William Rotko in turn based on a story by director Billy Ray with Mazur and Rotko transforms this infamous case into a fine melodrama . The result is a smart thriller , one that holds our attention despite the fact that the results of the case are public knowledge . Robert Hanssen ( in a brilliant performance by Chris Cooper ) works in national Intelligence and is a crusty , ominous character with some strange demons in his head . FBI Agent Kate Burroughs ( Laura Linney ) studies a young FBI clerk Eric O'Neill ( Ryan Phillippe ) and decides he is the one gritty and fearless enough to assign to the suspicious Hanssen , a man the FBI feels certain is a major suspect in the breach of security . Hanssen has been selling Intelligence reports to the Soviet Union but in so careful a manner that his status is almost impenetrable . Eric is married to an East German girl Julianna ( Caroline Dhavernas ) and while she is proud of Eric's advancement in the FBI she fears his preoccupation with his work . Hanssen and his wife Bonnie ( Kathleen Quinlan ) form a friendship with Eric and Julianna and that friendship , together with a shared near obsession with the Catholic Church , gains Hanssen's trust in Eric . The tension between the investigation by the FBI and Eric's role as a mole create some terrifying situations . But Eric overcomes all obstacles and proceeds to successfully match Hanssen's inscrutable mind and behavior and in the end takes great risks in all aspects of his life to fulfill his mission . The cast is excellent with special attention to the performances of Cooper , Phillippe , and Linney . The supporting roles are carefully cast with such fine actors as Gary Cole , Dennis Haysbert , and Bruce Davison . The production values add immeasurably to the aura of suspense . This is a fine movie not only for the qualities mentioned but also for bringing to light the lack of security from even the most trusted parts of our government . Disturbing food for thought and action . Grady Harp

Text2: El Día que me amen ( WHEN SOMEBODY LOVES ME ) is an important film from Argentina that bravely examines the spectrum of the effects of ' abandonment ' in childhood and how that seemingly minor act can transform lives . Based on a story idea by lead actor Adrián Suar and written for the screen by Marcos Carnevale and Marcela Guerty , this powerful movie steps beyond conventional tales of the distancing of childhood friends and moves into the arena of mental dysfunction and the long road to healing . Joaquín ( Adrián Suar ) and Mara ( Leticia Brédice ) are first seen as early 30s young adults , though their intimate childhood companionship is sensitively shown in flashbacks that appear like old home movies . Mara is an actress who has been traveling the world searching for a career and finally returns to Argentina for a chance to appear in a musical production of ' The Hunchback of Notre Dame ' . Mara is beautiful , talented , but a bit emotionally blurred , having left her fiancé in Spain just before their wedding . While her return is strained at first ( she is forced to break in to her own home because her mother forgot she was arriving ! ) , her mother Elvira ( María Rosa Fugazot ) and friends are happy she has returned after an 8-year absence . Mara is eager to see her childhood friend Joaquín who lives nearby , but there is a strange ambiance about his household : Joaquín has not left his room for two years , living in near silence in the dark , an obviously damaged young man . His father Ignacio ( Juan Leyrado ) is compassionate but feels Joaquín should be admitted to a psychiatric clinic . Joaquín pleads to stay at home and Ignacio agrees as long as his therapist doctor Balbis ( Jorge Marrale ) visits him daily . When Mara first sees Joaquín she is visibly disturbed , senses his problems , and begins to urge him out of his self-confinement . Slowly the two friends reveal each other's etiologies for maladjustment to life : Joaquín never recovered being abandoned first by his ill mother and second by Mara's abrupt leaving Argentina for her career , and Mara still is wounded by being abandoned by her father as a child and her failure to form lasting bonds with men . By opening memories and ultimately places outside Joaquín's house where they shared the intense bonding of their childhood each begins to heal : Mara has a successful evening as the star of her musical and regains her wounded self respect and Joaquín ( with the incredibly fine help of therapist Balbis ) shows he is shedding his pain of abandonment and growing toward a normal existence - these two factors set the stage for the film's conclusion . Director Daniel Barone takes this fragile tale and molds it into one of the more tender and touching films about the impact of childhood's ' tragedies ' that has been stated to date . The cinematography by Guillermo Zappino never forgets for a moment the dark tones underlying the lives of each of the characters . But the film would never have been so exacting and splendid were it not for the powerful performances by Adrián Suar and the extraordinarily beautiful and gifted Leticia Brédice ( ' Nine Queens ' , ' Burnt Money ' , ' Ashes from Paradise ' etc ) . The supporting cast is equally and homogeneously outstanding . This is one of those films that lingers in the mind , seeking stimuli for remembering our own demons of childhood , long after the credits are over . In Spanish with English subtitles , 110 minutes . Very Highly Recommended . Grady Harp","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: 17 years after his previous Columbo movie appearance , William Shatner again plays the murderer within a Columbo movie . His role is better and more interesting than was the case in his previous Columbo movie appearance but his performance isn't really though . Shatner goes terribly over-the-top with his role and he actually is a real B-actor , with an A-actor's status however , due to his "" Star Trek "" fame . It's actually quite fun to see him act but for all the wrong reasons , especially in the way he delivers his lines . Peter Falk on the other hand is really great , perhaps even better than usual . He seemed to be in a good mood while playing in this . He provides the movie with some great relieving humor . No big surprise that the movie features some good humor since the movie is directed by Dennis Dugan . Dugan is a director who mostly directed comedies throughout his career . He began his career with directing for TV but now days he also has some successful and well known theatrical movies behind his name , with "" I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry "" and "" You Don't Mess with the Zohan "" as the most recent examples . The movie has a real typical Columbo movie plot , that follows the usual formula and features all of the right requirements . So no surprises in this movie really or anything that makes this movie a special one but it's all good enough to please the average Columbo lovers . The killing is actually done quite good and original too bad that the rest of the movie its plot isn't that good or interesting . I love though how Lt . Columbo is trying to put pressure on the Shatner character by using his obvious love for his ( step ) daughter against him , later in the movie . So yes , despite Shatner this is still a fine average and certainly watchable Columbo movie entry .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Nice guy employee / law student Joey ( Cameron Mitchell ) tries to figure out what's going on , as suspicion shifts from one character to another . Originally filmed in 3-D ( and very vibrant color ) , it's a surprisingly fun B flick that belies its silly title . Some folks should have fun trying to figure out who done it . Ultimately , I agree with the consensus that it's lightweight and not exactly memorable stuff , but it's hard not to like . A simply excellent cast punches everything across : Anne Bancroft ( looking extremely delectable in her skimpy acrobat costume ) , Lee J . Cobb ( as a weary detective ) , Raymond Burr ( as the carny boss ) , Peter Whitney ( as a menacing-looking gorilla handler ) , Lee Marvin ( who supplies some good chuckles as a comedy relief cop ) , and Billy Curtis ( as a carny worker ) all do fine work . It may seem a little odd to see such distinguished actors in this film , but that's what makes it so interesting . Well paced , humorous , and leading to a finale that seems like a very low rent homage to "" King Kong "" , "" Gorilla at Large "" is not destined to be a classic , but it's fairly entertaining all the same .

After he passes on , Myles's personality undergoes a drastic change . Myles's wife ( ever gorgeous Jacqueline Bisset ) suspects something awfully creepy is going on , especially since it involves Elys ' provocative , sexy daughter Roxanne ( Barbara Parkins ) , whom she distrusts immediately . Complex but not unduly so , this obviously not too well known chiller could use a little more exposure . It moves a little slowly , but then again , it has a pretty good plot , and there are no interludes which waste time ; every scene has a purpose . For my tastes , it's not particularly scary , although it does exude some menace and atmosphere ; most effective are the various dream sequences , designed and photographed to create a truly surreal effect . Most useful are an unusual Jerry Goldsmith score , far removed from the Latin choruses that he provided for the more widely known Satanic horror flick "" The Omen "" , as well as a fine cast . Alda , the imposing Jurgens , Bisset , and Parkins are ably supported by Bradford Dillman , William Windom , and Kathleen Widdoes ; seen in a small role is Lilyan Chauvin , whom slasher fans will recognize as The Mother Superior in the tasteless seasonal favorite "" Silent Night , Deadly Night "" .

Text2: Turner Classic Film network was showing several "" before the Hays Code "" films from the 1930s last night , and I was able to watch this 1931 version of the Robert Sherwood play WATERLOO BRIDGE . Actually this version is closer to the original , written with the background of World War I in mind , than the classic 1940 Robert Taylor - Vivian Leigh version . But the latter has gotten exactly that status - it is a "" classic "" film , because Leigh was the star of the horizon at that moment in 1940 . She just won the Oscar for Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND , and this gave the studio the impetus to pull out the stops . Top notch cast and director , as well as better film productions assets . Ironically , looking at the cast for the 1931 film , it suffers . Yes it is by James Whale . . . but his best recalled films are FRANKENSTEIN , THE INVISIBLE MAN , and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN - hardly love stories . He did do the 1936 SHOWBOAT , but that seems an accident to his career . Such is the damage a good reputation can sometimes do to fully appreciate everything that the person did to earn his or her reputation . The stars of this are Douglas Montgomery ( here named Kent Douglas ) and Mae Clarke . Mae is immortal for one moment on film . In the middle of an argument over breakfast with her bored boyfriend Jimmy Cagney ( in PUBLIC ENEMY ) he pushes a grapefruit into her face ! She was a fine actress , but hardly of star quality . As for Montgomery , he was an above capable performer too , but his smooth , blond , bland features did not go very far . I suppose his best known part was in Katherine Hepburn's LITTLE WOMEN as "" Laurie "" the boy in the house next door who falls for Jo . I feel his best performance is in the 1935 MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD . He also played Stephen Foster ( whom he resembled a little ) in the forgotten early biography MELODY LANE . Two other performers in the cast are worth noting . One is old Frederick Kerr , here playing Montgomery's step-father , a doctor and major in the British Army , who spends most of the film in the countryside , enjoying his fine old port and going through one of those "" What . . . what "" characters , which were supposed to represent the kindly old , eccentric British upper classes . He played a similar role ( albeit as a German ) as Baron Frankenstein ( Colin Clive's father ) in FRANKENSTEIN , so I take it Whale liked his screen personae . The other , ironically , is Bette Davis . She is Montgomery's sister , and ( aside from shouting into her deaf step-father's ear to repeat what he claims he did not hear ) she has little to do . It was her third film . Davis later said ( in her partial autobiography MOTHER GODDAMN ) that she would have loved to play Myra . She did - more memorably - as Mildred , the waitress turned prostitute in OF HUMAN BONDAGE . Actually Clarke is very appealing as Myra . At the start of the film she is shown on the closing night of a West End Musical ( she was in the chorus ) , and Whale is clever enough to show her yawning at one point ( it does add to the realism of that moment ) . In the remake , Leigh was a promising ballerina whose romance with young Taylor causes her teacher ( Maria Ouspenskaya ) to throw her out of the troupe . The idea of chorus girls apparently was not classy enough for Leigh's screen personae in 1940 . Myra can't find another show to get into ( it's wartime , and there have been cut-backs in productions ) . Ironically , she tells her friend Kitty ( Doris Lloyd ) she could have been in the chorus of CHIN CHIN CHOW but chose the other show . It's like having the chance to do HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS , but opting for MR . PRESIDENT . CHIN CHIN CHOW set a West End record in the late teens and early 1920s . Because she can't get back into a show Myra - facing financial necessity - turns to prostitution . She is at Waterloo Bridge when she meets Montgomery during a zeppelin air raid ( Waterloo Bridge is a favorite spot to pick up "" Johns "" ) . The two of them end up going to her apartment by taxicab ( shades of Eliza Doolittle there ) . And they fall into love over a dinner of fish and chips . But Myra can't bring herself to confess what she does for a living - Montgomery is a naive American whose mother married an English country doctor . He does not have any idea about whores . Myra is somewhat older , and she too is American ( her parents were two alcoholics in East St . Louis , which is also the area Barbara Stanwyck comes from in the next film BABY FACE ) . She's more aware of the uglier side of life . Myra's moment of realization that she can't marry Montgomery is when she visits his mother , step-father , and sister in the country . His mother ( Enid Bennett ) gently explains that she would not be fit for Montgomery . Bennett does not push Clarke away ( and she does apparently sympathize with her ) , but she brings Clarke back to that reality that she tried to avoid . Clarke flees back to London , but Montgomery follows . Myra can't bring telling him . Instead it is her landlady ( Ethel Griffes ) in a moment of self-interest who reveals the truth - and gets Montgomery's best moment of reaction in the film in her face as a result . There is an element of melancholy in this that Whale succeeded in maintaining to the end and then some . I won't ruin the end of the film , but suffice it to say the love is as doomed as a flowering plant that is transplanted to a desert . It is a worthy film - not up to the later film's production and star quality - but well worth seeing .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
618,"Text1: Body of Lies is a fast-paced action thriller laced with a healthy dose of some of the more dangerous of modern political and military realities . It is , however , also laced with over-the - top action sequences and just a little too much Rambo-style superhuman stunts , although not exactly of the action variety . It has a dense and realistic narrative , although one that moves along at such a fast pace that you're almost afraid to take your eyes and ears off of it even for a second for fear of missing something . I found myself rewinding the DVD at least once every ten minutes or so to make sure I got everything right . This does , however , make for a very engaging action movie with a strong appeal to the more mature viewers , who are sure to appreciate a break from the standard Hollywood trash . It requires constant thought about and re-analysis of our political beliefs , but it doesn't ever overtly support or condemn either side ( if , in fact , the collective whole were to be reduced to two sides ) . For a movie to so directly approach the tense political atmosphere and the controversial situation of the American wars in the Middle East and not come off as pushing a political agenda of its own is a feat in itself , and it's only one of the many that Body of Lies successfully pulls off . Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Roger Ferris the CIA's man on the ground in the Middle East , who keeps in amazingly close contact with Ed Hoffman ( Russell Crowe ) via what must be a satellite phone , and a miraculously reliable one . Ferris shuttles easily between Iraq , Jordan , Syria , and other locations , speaking sufficiently fluent Arabic that he is not only able to pass himself off as a local but can also recognize his nurse's hometown by her accent . This guy has studied well . Hoffman is the bureaucrat back in Washington , an overweight white guy with a Texan accent and such a swagger in his attitude that it would not be at all surprising to see him wearing cowboy boots and smoking an enormous cigar . The comparisons to the real players in America's presidency ( at the time of the movie ) are as obvious as possible , and Ferris represents the movie's political statement , which thankfully is not for or against the war but for reminding us that what we see in TV is not the reality on the ground over there . Ferris and Hoffman are seeking out a terrorist kingpin , an obvious Osama bin Laden clone , which forces them to form a shaky allegiance with the head of the Jordanian Intelligence Agency , a deadly serious man named Hani Salaam . His one , simple request , "" Do not lie to me , "" seems simple enough and Ferris believes himself when he agrees to it , but deteriorating matters on the ground and conflicting orders from Hoffman start to make his promise more and more difficult to keep . The story takes us all over the world , but concentrates mostly on events taking place in Washington and the Middle East . The leap-frogging that Hoffman does between the U . S . and Iraq ( and the effortless leap-frogging that Ferris does all over the Middle East ) seem like something that belongs in a 007 movie , but the exaggerations of their tactical abilities are all designed to make a very important point . In fact , if the movie weren't grounded in reality by the message that it's passing on , it would easily have come off as little more than a tense political thriller with little bearing on real life other than passing on the political points of view of the film-making team behind it . The movie is about the American war in Iraq , there is no point beating around that little bush . It's about the Bush administration having brought us there and it's about the fact that now we're there and there is no end in sight . But it doesn't criticize the war or the war effort , it's about the harsh reality that there is no all-good side and no all-bad side . Hoffman repeats several times in the movie that no one is innocent in all of this as he tries to convince Ferris of the fact that in order to save lives , some innocent lives have to be lost . Ferris can't accept this , especially when it becomes personal , but he understands that it's true . In order to defeat this kind of enemy , we have to become like them in more ways than most people are willing to accept . The other problem is that , in the war against terrorism , the terrorists are invisible , and it's the well-prepared , trained , armed , and uniformed soldiers who are the easy targets , and for every one of them that we kill or capture , not only do two more spring up where they were , but an unknown number of innocent lives are all too often lost . This does not speak well for our chances of success . Ridley Scott builds here on his work in his outstanding film Black Hawk Down , and DiCaprio is also picking up where he left off in Blood Diamond , as an American with an incredible ability to blend into very different cultures and as a man that simply looks great yelling into a cell phone . Russell Crowe captures the all-American swagger ( and arrogance ? ) that got us into trouble in the first place , and for all of its excesses , it isn't until the final scene that the movie really reveals the real differences between Hoffman and Ferris which illustrate the meaning of the movie . In a heated exchange , when Ferris approaches the idea of no longer working for the CIA , Hoffman is understandably unhappy . "" You walk out that door , "" he says , "" and you're walking out on America . "" "" Be careful , "" Ferris says , "" about calling yourself America ? ""

Text2: There is some disagreement over whether or not this is really the first film in which Chaplin performed as the beloved Tramp , since apparently Mabel's Strange Predicament was filmed a month earlier ( although released two days later ) , but the interest of the film as the first time that audiences saw his famous character , as well as the fact that he was clearly still learning about it himself , remains clear . This was long before the times of screenplays and film scripts , and it is clear from watching the film that it is completely ad-libbed , but what is also clear is not only the talent but also the symbolism and the foreshadowing of Chaplin's later career , which Chaplin could not even have known he was doing himself . A lot of people have made the mistake of judging this film based on the quality of Chaplin's later work , which is ridiculous not only because the film was made during such an embryonic period of film history , but also because less than a half a year before it was made , Chaplin was acting on stage in England and knew absolutely nothing about film-making . Only a few years before this film was made , a film that depicted a group of people simply walking past the camera or people jumping into a lake was considered successful . The very thought of a "" moving picture "" had itself not lost its sense of being a novelty , so this film , if anything , was ahead of its time . What is also worth noting is that , in the world's first look at Chaplin's most famous character , we get such a clear sense of his love of the crowd and his desire to be in front of the camera . It is very important when watching these early films to keep in mind the historical context in which they were made , and not only the films made by Chaplin but from anyone else who was making them during this period . This is the very beginning of film-making in Los Angeles , a rare look at one of the cinema's biggest talents literally learning his talent on camera in a young Hollywood . To write the film off because of simple comedy or time-damaged quality is absurd . First of all , I am immediately fascinated by the film because of the fact that it was filmed in Venice , California , where I lived until about two months ago . Nothing is recognizable , since it was filmed 90 years ago and most of the setting is covered by crowds of people , but it should also be noted that Chaplin is literally trying on the costume which would soon make him one of the most famous people in the world , and in this six-minute comedy he is wandering around in a film learning his own act . That people today immediately demand high-budget quality from a film like this is ludicrous , to say the least . It's also interesting to consider the fact that , while the film is very , very simple and the improvised comedy is not complex in any way , it is also very real and fits perfectly as an introduction to Chaplin as an actor and the Tramp as an everyday character . Watch any live , on-location news broadcast today and look at what any jerk standing behind the camera is trying to do , and the realism of some guy at the auto races , the Tramp , wandering in front of the camera and mugging makes even more sense . It's also interesting to see the people in the background , curious about this new film thing , obviously staring directly at the camera and watching the filming . Chaplin , as he did in Making A Living , his first film , plays a bit of an unlikable character , but only unlikable as compared to what the Tramp would later become . He was a cheat and a swindler in Making A Living , while here he is just an annoying passer-by who won't go away . The film is book-ended by odd clippings of a note to "" his best girl , "" and it is unclear why he "" made tracks for the track , "" but for whatever reason , he was there and made it his mission to be in front of the camera of an increasingly irritated cameraman as much as possible . The cameraman that Charlie is constantly blocking is played by Henry Lehrman , who directed the first few of Chaplin's comedies and with whom Chaplin never had a very positive relationship , either on screen or off . So many people are immediately put off by the technical crudity or stylistic simplicity or physical decay of films like this , but I think that they are even more fascinating for reasons like this . Filmed more than 90 years ago , it is still a clear look at Chaplin's budding career , both on and off the screen . Only a few months later , he would begin directing his own films and his nearly unmatched career in film-making would be launched . Anyone with even a mild interest in film history or silent films should not miss this one , as it is a major landmark in cinematic history and the career of one of its biggest stars . For those of you that demand complex plots and polished film-making , maybe you should stick to watching modern film .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
619,"Text1: One of Robert McKimson's miscellaneous cartoons features a pair of hick possums trying to get their lazy son to do chores , to the point where the father dresses as a dog to scare the tyke . . . but the little guy turns out to be the Road Runner of possums ! Two of McKimson's one-shot cartoons that come to my mind feature animals not usually seen in Warner Bros . cartoons . Aside from "" Sleepy Time Possum "" there was "" Swallow the Leader "" ( starring swallows ) . I wonder what was up with that . Whatever it was , this is still worth seeing . Watching McKimson's cartoons , I notice that his characters have really prominent mouths , as opposed to the prominent eyes in cartoons by other directors ( compare the Bugs Bunny in Chuck Jones's and Friz Freleng's cartoons with that in McKimson's cartoons ) .

620,"Text1: It's easy to pass Xtro off as a piece of trash ; as that's essentially what it is , but those who are well versed in Sci-Fi horror will surely see it's positive elements shining through . It would seem that just about every idea director Harry Bromley Davenport ever had has ended up in this film , and so what we end up with is a disjointed and silly ; albeit continually shocking and inventive little movie , which blends over the top images of extreme gore with the corruption of a family unit . The film was a part of the DPP's ' Video Nasty ' list back in the eighties , which has ended up meaning that the film has an unfavourable reputation , which it doesn't really deserve ; both because the cheesy gore effects can't really be taken seriously , and because the film is too cheerful to be reputed as a shocker . The plot is actually quite good , as it follows a young boy who witnesses his father being taken by aliens . Naturally , nobody believes him ; although his story becomes somewhat more plausible three years later when his father reappears and disrupts the mother and her new man with his presence , and murderous new powers . The film features several memorable scenes , the best of which sees a woman giving birth to a fully grown man ! The special effects clearly didn't cost much , but that's not a problem as they fit the film and the director does well in ensuring that the effects are consistent in their style , and that they always fit the tone of the movie . The film was produced in Britain , and take obvious influence from Ridley Scott's masterpiece , ' Alien ' as well as a whole range of other Sci-Fi films . The plot is well used in conjunction with the idea of a malevolent alien coming to Earth and killing people , and by keeping the focus on the disrupted family unit ; director Harry Bromley Davenport manages to elevate the film above the normal level of B-grade schlock . The film isn't strong on atmosphere , although the poor production values do give it a gritty feel that bodes well with the plot . The acting is typically terrible , with only Bernice Stegers ( ' Macabre ' ) providing any kind of standout . Overall , this film will no doubt be too silly and inconstant for some ; but if you like your films to be weird and high on imagination ; you can't go wrong with Xtro !

Text2: This sort of movie isn't my thing at all . Normally these dramas are draped in fake sentiment and it leaves me feeling very queasy to say the least . However , I found myself with high hopes for this one because it's directed by one of today's best new directors ; Alejandro Amenábar , and after seeing his debut ; Tesis , along with the follow-up's Open Your Eyes and The Others , it's obvious that this man knows his stuff . For a movie that deals with the subject of euthanasia , you've got to expect a degree of sentiment ; and this movie certainly has more just a degree of it , but the sentiment is never overdone and Amenábar never looks like he's manipulating the audience into the plight of the protagonist . This is the difference between this film ; one told by a talented auteur , and the rush of sentiment dramas helmed by auteur's who are less than talented . Amenábar simply presents the plight , gives you a wealth of viewpoints , and it is then up to you to make your mind up about what you think . When it comes to the genuinely touching moments , therefore , we care because we WANT to care , and not because the movie is being forced down our throats . The story is that of Ramón Sampedro , a real-life Spanish man who fought a 30-year campaign for the right to end his life . As you would expect from a story of this nature , the film raises many questions about the value of life and whether it is worth living a life without dignity . The film plays out with a real life-affirming vigour , and there are several instances in the film that really will make you think . If a film can make you look at your own life and get you thinking about important issues , it's obvious that it's doing something right . The film is very bleak in it's approach , but this is offset by the uplifting way that we are able to see the character . Even though his biggest wish is to end his life ; we get behind him , and wanting our hero to die is a strange situation for an audience to be in . Javier Bardem gives a great performance as the unfortunate victim , and he heads a very believable cast of actors that give it their all and help to make the film the success that it is . Despite the greatness of this movie , I really would like to see Amenábar return to horror-thrillers for his next flick ; but at least he's proved that he can do other types of films too .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
621,"Text1: Early reports of this film's production were fairly promising . FOX had apparently taken note of fans ' hatred for Paul W . S . Anderson's first "" AvP "" movie , greenlighting a "" hardcore R "" sequel ( in the words of one of the film's producers ) . They also hired a couple geeks to direct the film , which caused the collective fanbase to celebrate across the Internet . One thing they neglected to mention : the film's budget was less than half of the first film's . This is never a good sign for a sequel - it means the studio doesn't have very much faith and is playing it safe . A $30 - $40 million budget is less risky than upping the ante . "" AvP "" performed well , but not exceptionally well , and part of its success was due to the PG-13 rating ; any R-rated film is going to have less of a chance of capturing the teen demographic , and let's face it : most of the fans ( not all , but most ) are teenagers . Then FOX dumped the film on Christmas Day , which - as anyone familiar with such tactics is well aware - happens to be "" spring cleaning "" for the studios . It's when they throw out all their garbage in the hopes of letting them die quietly in theaters and not having to risk paying more to open amidst the summer rush and potentially lose money . FOX also denied critics ' viewings and kept promotion to an absolute minimum ; I think I saw two TV spots and an ad on YouTube and that was about it . They mainly relied on Internet promotion , and probably no doubt encouraged the Brothers Strause to participate in conversations online with fans to help set up the illusion of a "" fan driven project . "" The truth is the Strauses are quite inept and FOX took advantage of their naivety to rush out a sloppy , B-movie sequel that looks cheap and has some of the most unintentionally funny moments I've seen in recent memory . First of all , the cinematography : awful . Couldn't see anything . The Strauses denied this numerous times online , blaming faulty projectors , but that is obviously a lie , whether they are aware of it or not . The truth is , the film's creature effects are so low budget and poor that the dark lighting and incomprehensible editing ( it's impossible to tell what's going on - it's like Michael Bay on crack ) only really serves to help disguise this . I don't have anything wrong with this per se , but when it SEVERELY alters the effectiveness of your film - to the point where viewers don't have a clue what's happening - that's a big problem . Especially when your film's entire selling point is essentially getting to watch big scary monsters fight each other . The second blunder of this film is also a direct result of the low budget . The fake backgrounds looked about on par with what most film students can do nowadays with basic effects editing suites . I suppose they used a lot of green screens to save money ( no on-location shoots ) , but it looks awful . I see the Strause Brothers have a background in visual F / X and helped work on "" 300 "" - that may very well explain this problem . This visual style may have worked very well for "" 300 "" - but "" AvP "" ( especially this one ) attempts to align itself with reality , so all the fake backgrounds just make it seem like you're watching a Hallmark Hall of Fame special . Speaking of Hallmark and made-for-TV movies - - the teen subplot here was like John Hughes if John Hughes hadn't known how to write good dialogue or hire talented actors . First of all , we have the typical "" high schoolers "" being portrayed by actors in their mid-to-late ' 20s . Fun stuff . They also can't act , which results in hilarious misreadings of dialogue and bad takes that any experienced director would have left on the cutting room floor . The dialogue itself sounds about as bad as it would look on paper - the film's first 15 minutes introduces a kid working at a pizza place ( yes , it jumps from an opening involving Predators and Aliens and Predaliens aboard an intergalactic ship slaughtering each other one by one - to suddenly focusing on some kid in Hicksville , USA delivering pizzas to a girl he has a crush on ) . The dialogue in this scene alone was enough to make me laugh and it only gets worse from there . I don't mean to sound too harsh against the Strauses because honestly I don't think they really knew what they were doing - FOX took advantage of their willingness and cooperation , trying to market the film strictly to the fans . But still . Say what you will about Paul Anderson as a director , but he has an excellent visual style in terms of cinematography and especially set design . He's awful with every other aspect of film-making , but at least the first AvP had the set design going for it . AvP : Reqiuem's ultimate flaw is that it's not fun . I don't want to give the impression that I was expecting another "" Godfather "" here - I just wanted some simple entertainment - but it's borderline mediocre and the sort of thing you'd find on TV at 2 in the morning . It's just a genuine disappointment and I hope all the franchises involved - Alien , Predator , and the crossover - can recover in the future . I'd like to see an Alien 5 and Predator 3 without any references to this having ever been made .

Text2: Ken Russell's "" Whore "" begins with an amusing shot of cars driving through a tunnel ( R-rated Freudianism ? ) coupled with a Jamaican rap on the soundtrack about doing the "" boom boom "" with girls . Russell , who directed the film and co-adapted the screenplay from David Hines ' play , is highly adept at quirky bits of business - - blending hammy , outré comedy with blunt-force dramatics - - but with "" Whore "" , his mix of in-your-face , sexually-comedic bits and pieces are not always compatible bedmates next to the violence or the introspective moments . Theresa Russell plays Liz , a streetwise hooker full of bravado ; often addressing the camera directly , Theresa speaks with an odd swagger in her voice ( as if she's channeling someone standing beside her ) . Striking amazing poses - - like Lolita all grown up - - Theresa Russell has some choice moments ( usually when she's not speaking , as with a silent come-on to a guy who turns out to be gay ) , but she is not a vulgar , cartoony actress and is too refined to be slutty . Her performance continually improves , however it isn't in the actress's nature to talk tough like a lady truck-driver . Though the film is neither sexy nor even memorable , it does have well-wrought sequences ( such as when Russell's friendship with a possible lesbian is interrupted by a vicious pimp , an incredible moment done without principle dialogue ) . Those looking for a raucous good time will be disappointed ( can you imagine how this film's inelegant title looked on the movie theater marquees ? ) , and those hoping for a more serious take on the prostitution business probably won't stick around past the first hour .

Text2: It's one thing to come up with a great title and quite another to write a novel that lives up to it and Robert Penn Warren more than succeeded with his Pulitzer Prize winner All The King's Men ; it's possible that not too many people in England were aware that Huey Pierce Long was also known as the ' Kingfish ' and that one of his most potent slogans was ' every man a king ' but even so the notion of a Humpty Dumpty figure falling from a great height and being unmendable was still a great metaphor bearing in mind that the ' men ' in question were Long's close circle of powerful friends . Robert Rossen was able to extract the juice of this great novel albeit condensing its richness and he was well served by an exceptional cast from Brod Crawford down ; Bilko fans , for example , will relish Paul Ford , albeit uncredited , in a ' straight ' role and mediocre actors like John Ireland , Shepherd Strudwick and Joanne Dru ( Mrs John Ireland ) all did their best work here but ultimately it is Crawford's charismatic role that carries all before it .

630,"Text1: Following the great success of their masterpiece THE MIKADO ( see TOPSY - TURVEY ) William Schwenck Gilbert and Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan had time on their hands - THE MIKADO ran for almost two years , their longest hit . It was not until 1887 that Richard D'Oyly Carte felt it necessary to discuss their next production . He and Sir Arthur were dismayed to see that Gilbert was all for pushing his old stand-by , the magic lozenge plot on them . You may recall that this was a lozenge that when ingested allowed the user to change personality and character to whomever they wanted . But Gilbert again met with a decisive "" NO ! "" from both partners . So he went back to his study . The operetta libretto he came up with was a spoof on Victorian melodramas : set in a seaside village called Rederring , the story is about how young Robin Oakapple is interested in marrying fair Rose Maybud , but faces two major obstacles . First he is not Robin Oakapple , but the missing and presumed dead "" Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd "" , baronet of Ruddygore ( the name later was changed , but it is slowly returning to the original spelling ) . Robin did not want to be baronet - there is a curse that the baronet has to commit one crime a day for every day of his life or perish in agony . Only his foster brother , the Georgian navy sailor Richard Dauntless knows the truth about Robin's birth . Unfortunately , Richard is also in love with Rose Maybud . That is the second major obstacle . Gilbert had fun with stereotypes from Victorian melodrama here . Richard Dauntless has to be truthful and good - but his use of truthfulness here certainly is good only for Richard , as he uses his knowledge of Robin's real identity to push his own advantage . Robin's younger brother , Sir Despard , gets rid of his evil obligation early in the morning , and then spends the rest of the day using his money to do only deeds . One of Despard's evil acts was to desert Margaret , a young woman who loved him . She goes mad , and pursues everyone with her mad but inane behavior . Later , when Robin reluctantly returns to his role as Baronet , Despard marries Margaret . To control her he keeps repeating the name of a notorious insane asylum : "" Basingstoke "" . It works ! Rosa's sweet aunt Dame Hannah , recites the song that tells about the "" witch's curse "" on the bad Baronets of Ruddygore . Later she is kidnapped but turns out to be fully armed with a battle-ax . She happened to be in love with Ruthven's predecessor to the title , Sir Roderick Murgatroyd . It later turns out their pet names for each other were "" Roddy - Doddy "" and "" Little Nanikins ! "" . The highpoint of the operetta was when Ruthven had to give his daily accounting of crime to his ancestors . Led by Sir Roderick , they descend from their portraits in the gallery and surround him . Gilbert probably heard of a similar idea in a French production , but he used one in a one act musical he wrote called AGES AGO in the 1870s . RUDDYGORE attracted acceptance by Sullivan and Carte , and was put on . It met with several problems . The title turned off people because it reminded people of the taboo word ( in Victorian England ) "" bloody "" . That is why a disgusted Gilbert changed the "" y "" to "" i "" . Then Richard Dauntless ' opening song about a naval fight in the Napoleonic Wars ended when the French apparently fought indifferently . This led to criticism from France and it's government about the insult . In the end RUDDYGORE ran only eight months , and then was replaced by repeats of THE MIKADO and other productions . Fortunately , in 1888 , Gilbert and Sullivan produced THE YEOMAN OF THE GUARD , which ran for over a year ( followed by THE GONDOLIERS , which also ran for over a year ) . RUDDYGORE ( or RUDDIGORE ) has had a mixed reception ever since it's first production . A cartoon that was in a biography of it's two creators suggested it is a bore . It really is not , having some really effective tunes in it , one of which , the patter trio in Act II , was transposed to THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE in the film with Kevin Kline . Also Gilbert did have some fun with that curse ( Ruthven decides to wickedly disinherit his only son - only to be reminded he has no son ) . But it is usually not considered one of the top tier operettas of the pair . This production was done in the early 1980s , as part of a series of the operettas from TRIAL BY JURY through THE GONDOLIERS . The series had some prominent performers in it , such as Clive Revill in THE SORCERER as John Wellington Wells . Here the role of Despard was played by Vincent Price , and that of Robin / Ruthven was played by Keith Mitchell . They did well with their dialog but both were mediocre in singing ( or in Price's case "" talk-singing "" ) . Donald Adams , who had been with the D'Oyly Carte Company , was far more effective as Sir Roderick , in particular in singing one of the saddest ballads in Gilbert & Sullivan , his second act duet with Dame Hannah , "" There grew a little flower ' neath a great oak tree . "" It was nice to see any kind of attempt at producing this rarely shown work by Gilbert & Sullivan , and so I will say it was definitely worth a "" 6 "" on our scale .

Text2: Lorenz Hart wrote in a different style from his successor as partner to Richard Rodgers ( Oscar Hammerstein 2nd ) . Hart had a more smart alecky type of lyric , less wholesome . But he still was quite a clever and intelligent lyricist . His tragedy was a personal one . Hammerstein had a happy home life . Hart was a troubled bi-sexual ( most of the time he was actually a homosexual , but he did love at least one of his Broadway stars , Vivian Siegal , and proposed to her late in his life ) . He also had a serious drinking problem . Rodgers too had an alcohol problem , but it was in relative control until the 1960s . Hart's growing binges in the 1930s and early 1940s began to fray the partnership . Rodgers would later admit he got tired being a nurse to his partner . Their partnership was remarkably fruitful from the early 1920s to it's completion in 1944 , both on Broadway and in Hollywood . But most of their musicals were in the old fashion method of the songs fitted into the book - not worked into the book . Towards the end of the 1930s , with their "" Shakespeare "" musical THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE and their ballet / dance musical ON YOUR TOES they started doing more modern style musicals where the songs were used to push the story along . But it was not until 1940 that they came up with their masterpiece : PAL JOEY . PAL JOEY was based on a novel by John O'Hara ( author of BUTTERFIELD 8 and APPOINTMENT IN SAMARRA ) . It is actually a modern epistolary novel , with Joey writing letters describing his adventures to a friend ( hence ending the letters with "" Your pal , Joey "" ) . Joey , to put it bluntly , is an opportunistic heel using people all over the place . He hopes to eventually create the classiest nightclub in Chicago ( Joey is a professional emcee ) . He meets two women ( Linda who is his age , and Vera who is older and richer ) . He keeps jumping and reassuring each until he is caught up in a set of cross-purposed lies . A blackmail attempt puts an end to the entire dream , and both women dump Joey . His last song is how his best friend is himself . The original musical flopped - Broadway was yet to be ready for a musical with an anti-hero . But it had a splendid score of clever tunes , many with double-entendre lyrics ( such as "" Happy Little Hunting Horn "" and "" Our Little Den of Iniquity "" ) . It had Siegal as Vera ( she introduced "" Bewitched , Bothered , and Bewildered "" ) , Elaine Stritch ( in a supporting part as a reporter who interviewed Gypsy Rose Lee - she sang "" Zip "" ) , and ( as the star ) Gene Kelly . It's nice to report that there is surviving color and black and white film from home cameras of Kelly in several scenes dancing . None with the music , however . It was not until a 1951 revival that the musical became a smash hit . If you read the facts on this thread you will see how long the studios tried to get PAL JOEY onto film . It was not until 1957 that it finally got made . Kelly had been originally wanted for repeating the role , but circumstances prevented this . Instead the role ended up with Frank Sinatra , Vera was played by the film's actual star , Rita Hayworth , and Linda by Kim Novak . The main structure of the story was kept , such as the triangle and Joey's dream of being owner / boss of the classiest nightclub ( here , though , in San Francisco ) . Joey's heel personality is still there , but softened towards the end ( in the musical he is a heel to the conclusion ) . The blackmail plot ( involving Gladys Bumps and her boy-friend Ludlow Lowell ) is dropped , although Gladys remains as a hostile , suspicious chorus girl ( she knows Joey's past ) played well by Barbara Nicholls . The cast was a Columbia one , with only one face that is a fair regular one among Sinatra cronies ( Hank Henry as Mike , the nightclub manager - he also popped up in OCEAN'S ELEVEN and THE JOKER IS WILD ) . It is a well done song fest of Rodgers and Hart tunes , although two tunes ( MY FUNNY VALENTINE and THERE'S A SMALL HOTEL ) are not from the show's score , and most of the tunes are dropped . ZIP is rewritten so that it is sung by Vera , formerly a "" Gypsy Rose Lee "" type . But the remainder keep the basic idea of the musical in tact - including a number showing Joey's dream of what his "" Chez Joey "" would have been like . But it is , on the whole , a wonderfully well made musical and certainly among Sinatra's best .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

P M is not very happy about his brother showing up , because he never told anyone about his brother and that he had a bad problem with drinking which caused most of the problems in his life . Ruth Roman , ( Nora Martin ) played the role as wife to P M who did not really get along and now that Donald Martin appears , his wife becomes interested in her husband's new friend , not knowing it is his brother . There is plenty of action and this is truly a great classic from the Year 1956 , enjoy . Nora Martin teaches her husband about being your Brother's Keeper , the hard way .

Text2: This is truly a great classic film from 1937 with an all star cast of veteran actors and a great producer , Frank Capra . Ronald Colman , ( Bob Conway ) ; Jane Wyatt , ( Sondra Bizet ) were the stars of this picture along with great supporting actors : Edward Everett Horton , George Mitchell . Sam Jaffe ( High Lama ) gave an outstanding performance as the Supreme Lama with a soft spoken voice and a man full of deep wisdom and spiritual knowledge . This is a film about a Lost Horizon where most people want to go and live after experiencing the horrors of World War 1 & 2 . Bob Conway and his passengers were flying in an airplane when the pilot crashes into a mountain top and they are stranded in deep snow and it looks like there is absolutely no way to survive . One of the passengers finds some Mountain Grass and offers it to the other people on the plane , this Mountain Grass looks like big clumps of a dead plant . There is deep meaning to this film , which seems to indicate that men and women are still seeking to find another Garden of Eden where they can live in harmony with their other brother and sisters . However , man's human nature will never allow this to happen . Good Film Enjoy","{""output"": ""YES""}"
632,"Text1: I viewed a print of "" Helen's Babies "" that was restored by the Library of Congress ; despite their laudable efforts , the first title card is missing , and the nitrate deterioration is prominent throughout the first reel . I mention these flaws not to chivvy the wonderful people at LoC but because Diana Serra Cary ( more about her later ) has told me she has viewed every known surviving print of this movie , and she claims that LoC's is the best print in existence . "" Helen's Babies "" is often cited as a Clara Bow movie , since she's the cast member who remains most well-known and popular . She has considerably less screen time here than Edward Everett Horton and the titular children , and Bow's hairstyle and make-up here are not the ones she wore during her stardom . Director William Seiter gives Bow no star treatment whatever : during her first scene ( oddly clutching a white cane : where's her tin cup and her guide dog ? ) , Bow receives no close-ups at all , and the sequence is blocked so that several other characters stand in front of her , preventing the camera from even getting a clear view of her . Because Edward Everett Horton is remembered for his distinctive vocal traits , it's intriguing to see him in this SILENT film . Horton displays less of the "" nelly "" body language here than he did in his later films , possibly because in this movie his character is attracted to Clara Bow . Horton's character here wears a wristwatch : a decade earlier , male wristwatches were often regarded in American culture as a symbol of effeminacy , but that stereotype was put paid during WW1 when wristwatches proved more useful than pocket watches for the doughboys in the trenches . The film's premise is strictly Plot-o-Matic : Harry Burton ( Horton ) has written a best-selling book about child-rearing even though he knows nothing about the subject . Because of his alleged expertise , his sister Helen Lawrence and her husband connive to put him in charge of their two young daughters while the parents go off on a holiday . To show what great parents they are , Mr and Mrs Lawrence depart BEFORE Horton arrives , leaving the wee tykes to their own devices . From here we're in Baby Herman territory , with the girls wreaking mayhem that causes problems for Horton . Oh , those girls ! Annoyingly named Budge and Toodie , they are refreshingly played by two genuinely delightful child actresses , giving affectless and believable performances . Budge is played by gap-toothed Jeanne Carpenter , but the ringleader of their mayhem ( Toodie ) is played by none other than Baby Peggy , in a truly virtuoso performance . Baby Peggy ( now known as Diana Serra Cary ) is still alive and well as I write this ; I first met her in October 2006 at the Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy : while watching "" Helen's Babies "" , I found it rather strange to be viewing the antics of a five-year-old in 1924 while realising that I KNOW her ( considerably older but still young at heart ) in 2007 ! In an early scene , Baby Peggy clutches a Felix the Cat doll : could this be an early example of product placement ? Much of this comedy's effect is down to the crucial fact that Toodie and Budge are genuinely guileless in all their mischief : unlike Beryl the Peril or the Katzenjammer Kids , they have no malice for their adult guardian . Most of the comedy works , although I disliked one scene in which Baby Peggy continually tweaks the face of the sleeping Horton without wakening him : since Horton's character wasn't drugged or comatose , I couldn't believe that he could sleep through this . Also , Horton's character often behaves implausibly . . . as when he gives the girls his wristwatch to play with , then he forgets to reclaim it . In several sequences the comedy depends upon suspense , with Toodie wandering into genuinely dangerous situations ( and no stunt double available for Baby Peggy ) . These sequences are staged and edited skilfully to keep the child actress safe while making her character seem to be in danger . . . as when Toodie falls off a high tree bough without Baby Peggy actually being placed at treetop height . Where the comedy really fails ( for modern sensibilities ) is in this movie's racial stereotypes . The Lawrences engage a black handyman who enters the house in a servile cringe , and who runs away from a frightening event at superhuman speed ( via undercranking ) . The black chauffeur's one dialogue title is written in "" yassuh "" dialect . More positively , black actress Mattie Peters gives a very realistic and humane performance here ( unlike her role in ' The Bedroom Window ' ) as the housekeeper who clearly loves the two little girls and who is likely the only reason they haven't died of neglect by their careless parents . Even more extensive ( and offensive ) than the stereotyping of the black characters in this movie is the extreme stereotyping of some Italian characters who arrive in a Romany caravan and speak in Chico Marx dialect . When Toodie and Budge wander into their camp , the sequence is staged to emphasise the swarthiness and foreign behaviour of these transients : the girls are potentially in danger not because they're among strangers , but rather because these are dark-skinned foreigners . The climactic sequence , with the two girls and a dog on a railway track while a train hurtles towards them , is well-staged and has one hilariously unexpected gag . Train-spotters will be intrigued that the choo-choo in this sequence is the only steam locomotive ever made which stops at the precise instant when the engineer pulls the brake , instead of half a mile farther down the rails . At least , that's what we see here . Despite an astonishingly good performance by Baby Peggy and one almost equally as good by Jeanne Carpenter , many of the gags in this movie were too obvious or too implausible or both . I would have liked this comedy better without the stereotyping of Negroes and Italians . My rating : , and most of that is for Baby Peggy's and Horton's performances .

Text2: ' The Masquerader ' , an obscure drama starring Ronald Colman , is very similar in its premise and subplots to Colman's great vehicle ' The Prisoner of Zenda ' . . . but he did ' The Masquerader ' first . As in ' Zenda ' , Colman plays lookalike cousins who meet after many years of living in two different countries . . . one of whom has an opportunity to take over the other's life , while falling in love with the other man's disenchanted lady . Colman's main role is John Loder ( no relation to the bland actor of that name ) , a disaffected journalist who returns to his native England after many years abroad . Loder's more successful cousin is Sir John Chilcote , a prominent member of Parliament . But Chilcote is secretly a morphine addict , and his addiction is becoming harder to conceal . Also concealed ( not very well ) is Chilcote's philandering relationship with Lady Joyce , while his estranged wife Eve ( Lady Chilcote ) is humiliated on the sidelines . When Sir John's addiction causes him to collapse just before he introduces a crucial piece of legislation , Chilcote's loyal manservant Brock persuades Loder to impersonate his cousin . Loder , pretending to be Chilcote , gives an impassioned speech on the floor of Commons . Lady Chilcote has been estranged from her husband for years ; now , attending this speech , she wonders why she is suddenly attracted to her husband again . . . not realising that this is actually Loder impersonating Lady Chilcote's husband . ( Shades of Princess Flavia in ' Zenda ' . ) Meanwhile , Loder ( still pretending to be Chilcote ) is utterly cold to Chilcote's mistress Lady Joyce , much to her bafflement . SPOILERS COMING . Sir John dies of his addiction , without this becoming public knowledge . Brock persuades Loder to abandon his own life and become Sir John Chilcote permanently , appropriating Chilcote's wealth and reputation . Of course , this means that Loder will now be married to Lady Chilcote . Hmmm . . . ' The Masquerader ' is not very plausible , yet it's quite enjoyable . Ronald Colman gives two distinctly different performances in the lookalike roles . . . although his turn as the drug-addicted Chilcote is a bit too overwrought . Moss Hart's smooth dialogue papers over some of the cracks in the plot line . Gregg Toland's photography is up to his usual high standard , and I was especially impressed by the scenes in which both Ronald Colmans are on screen at the same go . ( Most dual-role movies made during this period featured flat sideline lighting during the double-exposure sequences ; Toland avoids this . ) Also well-photographed is a night sequence in Hyde Park ( filmed on the Goldwyn Studio's backlot ) ; Toland keeps the lighting bright enough for us to see the action , but dark enough to minimise the obvious fakery of the scenery . Creighton Hale is good in a small role . In the role of Lady Eve Chilcote , Elissa Landi is appropriately patrician ( and slightly less blonde than usual ) , but her performance is weak . In the role of Lady Joyce , Juliette Compton is so dull and unattractive that I had difficulty believing Sir John would ever prefer her to his wife . The studio reconstruction of the House of Commons is a lot more convincing than I expected it to be , especially for a Yank film . I'll rate this movie .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: While I admit to falling asleep at some scenes ( parts of Tai Lung's escape and some of Po's training ) , I was mostly highly amused and entertained by what Shifu ( Dustin Hoffman ) was teaching Po ( Jack Black ) . In fact , this was one of the most entertaining of the Dreamworks Animation features . Po gets befriended by five other of Shifu's students : Viper ( Lucy Liu ) , Monkey ( Jackie Chan ) , Crane ( David Cross ) , Mantis ( Seth Rogen ) , and Tigress ( Angelina Jolie ) . The villain , Tai Lung ( Ian McShane ) , was another student of Shifu's whose attitude got him jailed for 20 years . Also of interest is Mr . Ping , Po's restaurateur father ( James Hong ) , who turns out to be quite an inspiration to his son though it doesn't seem that way at first . Black's line readings and the animation movements of his panda character are some of the funniest I've seen and heard on the screen yet and the relationship between Po and Shifu are some of the best mixture of funny and touching especially the end scenes that end up quite differently than you'd expect ( perhaps the fact Kung Fu Panda is mainly meant for kids have something to do with it ) . So on that note , this movie comes highly recommended for the whole family though it's okay if you just watch this alone or with a friend as I did . P . S . I loved the 2-D animation that began this movie ( which included the unique way the Dreamworks logo was done here ) .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
635,"Text1: This is one of three other production documentaries included on the two-disc DVD of Troy , and it tells some interesting footage about how some of the special effects were done and how they were edited together . My favorite is how they talk about how a shot of the Greek soldiers storming across the beach toward Troy was filmed on a beach in Mexico while the shot of them entering the city was filmed in Malta , on the other side of the world . Both shots were filmed on a cable ( another interesting technique explained here ) and edited together into a single shot . So without even cutting , a smooth tracking shot switches locations thousands of miles apart and is perfectly smooth . I love that . One of the guys on the special effects crew also talks about how they took out about 60 % of the ships that appeared in the trailer for the film because it just looked too crowded , they were sailing too close together , taking each other's wind , etc . That's a pretty interesting story , I just found it a bit odd because the shot they refer to is not in the theatrical trailer included with the DVD . Maybe they took them out of the theatrical trailer , too . But the thing that I found most impressive was that they wrote their own software for creating many of the special effects shots in the movie because there wasn't really any software available on the market that could accomplish everything that they wanted to do . There was an incredible amount of work put into making people believe that they were looking at history and not at a movie , and in my opinion it was with much success . The video also includes an interesting segment on the sound effects in the movie , which are always interesting . See , for example , the segments on sound effects in the making-of Indiana Jones documentaries . That's the kind of thing that makes me want to learn more about how sound is done in movies ! Overall it's a good show , but the editing again is jolting , there is quite often not enough time allowed for you to get a good look at the sets and locations . There's nothing worse than a behind-the-scenes documentary that doesn't allow you enough time to get a look behind the scenes before cutting to something else . Luckily the information revealed in the video is still very interesting . My biggest gripe is that , over all three of the documentaries included on the supplemental DVD that comes with the movie , there is all of a single , solitary line included from an interview with Peter O'Toole , by far the biggest actor involved with the film . Disappointing , to say the least .

Text2: It is one of my unwritten principles about film criticism never to say things like "" Such-and - such movie could only have come from the mind of so-and-so . "" It's a self-congratulatory phrase that sell-out critics ( film critics and books critics alike ) use in efforts to get their names on movie or book covers , and having been a fan of writers like Clive Barker and Stephen King since I was about 11 years old , I've heard it more than enough times for it to have become an empty cliché in my mind . Nevertheless , The Midnight Meat Train , my friends , could only have come from the mind of Clive Barker . Sorry about that . It has been probably something like 15 years since I read Barker's Books of Blood , and pretty much the only thing I remembered very clearly from The Midnight Meat Train were the creatures on the train and that thing with the tongue at the end of the story . That's an image that won't leave your mind easily ! I also recommend reading "" The Skins of the Fathers "" and "" The Body Politic , "" the latter of which was featured in the disappointing film Quicksilver Highway . Bradley Cooper stars as Leon , young photographer desperate to earn the recognition of a local famous artist named Susan Hoff . Unfortunately , his main technique is the gigantic cliché of trying to "" capture the city as it really is , "" which has to be the most uninteresting goal imaginable for any photographer . Maybe he doesn't understand for how many decades that exact same thing has been pursued by countless tens of thousands of photographers . As is to be expected , Susan is unimpressed and wants something more , so Leon soon finds himself perusing the late-night subways trying to catch the perfect stills of violent crimes in progress . He discovers a man who has a habit of riding the last train past the last stop and butchering the remaining subway inhabitants like cattle , and Leon becomes obsessed with getting to the bottom of the crimes , only to discover that this particular series of murders has a history that can be traced back well over a century . The movie is padded pretty heavily , of course , given that it's adapted from a short story , but for the most part it stays true to the original tale . Mostly , certain things are fleshed out a lot more , characters are added , and other side elements are added completely , but the disturbing heart of the story is here . We could easily have done without Leon's atrocious girlfriend , however . She has to be the whiniest , most self-righteous and controlling woman that I've seen in a movie in years . They are meant to be getting married soon , and when Leon photographs an attempted gang-rape in progress and then the victim later goes missing ( and the police don't believe anything is really going on ) , his girlfriend is not for one second supportive or interested or even concerned , she simply instructs him not to take night photography anymore . She informs him that he is to turn in his photos to the police and move on . She also has an emotional scene in the second half of the movie that is such a preposterously bad piece of acting that it made me want to throw myself in front of a meat train ! As a horror movie it works surprisingly well . There is at least one shot that I've never seen done in any horror movie , and I've been a pretty avid horror fan for nearly two decades . Unfortunately , there are also more than a few scenes that simply make no sense whatsoever . Mahogany , the "" butcher "" ( played by Vinnie Jones ) has bloody gastric problems that are never really quite explained , although the more distracting aberration is his bizarre outbreak of marble-sized moles or warts that covers his chest , which he routinely cuts off with a scalpel and collects in jars in his medicine cabinet . It's a satisfactorily horrible affliction , to be sure , but it would have been nice if it hadn't just been thrown in randomly for effect . I was also a little confused by the Asian hottie that gets assaulted near the beginning of the movie . She nearly gets gang-raped by a group of gangsters , is barely saved , and proceeds to get on the subway alone anyway . It was weird enough that she was riding the subway home alone in the middle of the night anyway ( she's a MODEL , by the way ) , but man , she sure made a quick recovery from the attack ! Later , a group of kids are walking through the subway selling fund-raiser candy bars at 2am . I hope they get a dedication merit badge for that ! The movie is shot in a properly metallic blue that permeates just about every shot of the movie , never letting you forget that you're looking at a series of horror movie sets , but this is still leaps and bounds better than the vast majority of horror movies being heaved into theaters these days . It has buckets and buckets of gore and so will definitely satisfy the gore-hounds , but it has an interesting story which prevents it from coming off as a stupid , mindless orgy of violence , like Eli Roth's head-smackingly stupid film Hostel . The thing that I have always appreciated about Clive Barker's stories ( and Stephen King's ) is that the better ones are not just scary movies , they have something of what Freud called the "" uncanny . "" They tell stories of familiar things , familiar objects , but cast them in a light and place them in surroundings that make them off-putting on a level that lesser horror films can't even begin to aspire to . So even when the CGI blood effects are laughably bad , the arc of the story is taking us somewhere so different than what we're used to that it's pretty easy to overlook . For horror fans , this is a definite must-see .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

It's been said ( yes by me , as well ) that with the most recent rash of remakes and remixes , Hollywood has become stagnant . Do they not understand that Hollywood has always believed in remakes ?

RKO did the 1933 version of King Kong ; the beloved classic . And now , Universal's doing what it's always done . It's remaking it . Edgar Wallace , whose novels and stories have been committed to film for decades now , was the principal writer of this epic tale of savagery . Merian C . Cooper also wrote this story ( along with Wallace ) , produced and directed the original 1933 work , and flew the plane which killed the beast , in that same work . So as a 1933 RKO production , this movie had the novelty of being new , fresh ; a work which had never been given to the public in any form before . Save for one . Beauty and the Beast , first committed to film as far as I can tell , in 1899 . So King Kong was just a new spin on a much older tale , which is fine by me .

637,"Text1: 1940 was a wonderful year for "" lost spouse returning "" films . Both this film as well as MY FAVORITE WIFE debuted a short time apart and they are , on the surface , very , very similar movies . In MY FAVORITE WIFE , Irene Dunne is lost at sea and assumed dead . Years later , she's declared legally dead and Cary Grant ( her husband ) remarries . Dunne then returns just after the wedding and hilarity ensues . In TOO MANY HUSBANDS , Fred MacMurray is lost at sea and assumed dead . He's declared dead almost right away and Jean Arthur ( his wife ) remarried . Fred then returns to find she now has two husbands and only a little bit of hilarity ensued ! In fact , because these two films were so similar , lawsuits were launched . I really don't know how they were settled or which movie came first . All I know is that MY FAVORITE WIFE is definitely the better of the two . The fact that TOO MANY HUSBANDS was only showed on TCM for the first time a week ago is probably indication that it is the lesser films - - especially since MY FAVORITE WIFE is a commonly seen film on American cable TV . The problem is the writing . While the cast of TOO MANY HUSBANDS is just fine ( Jean Arthur , Fred MacMurray and Melvin Douglas ) , the lines they are given and the situations they are placed in just aren't as funny . In particular , Jean's character is VERY annoying at times - - as she seems like a selfish and immature person throughout the film . This is BAD , as Jean's usual screen persona is of a sweet and spunky lady - - here she in an indecisive and whiny person .

Conversely , the fact that Cary and Irene in the other film truly love each other never really is in question - - the problem is just figuring out HOW to extricate themselves from the mess ! While this is still a pretty good film ( nearly meriting a 7 ) , it just isn't in the same league as the other one . If you love old films like I do , see them both . If you only want to pick one , then the answer is pretty obvious .

638,"Text1: A potential title with a potential story that loses potential ! ? ? ! The movie is confusing but not really when it all comes down to this . Stacy Keach is a teacher and he has taken his students on a big field trip . A teenage girl who is bothered by memories and seeing strange things like human like beings in animal type coats is being treated by a shrink to see if this is her imagination or if its something else . Her and her friends are terrorized by the beings on this field trip . So is it true that her thoughts are real or is this just a bunch made up stuff by her ? Is this beast-man is Bigfoot ? A werewolf , a mutant bear , perhaps a wild cave man or Neanderthal man ? Could it be a new breed of human ? Could it be the imagination man or could it be a old guy who thinks he is the last of the great vikings . Could it be a cat-man ? Maybe it could possibly be the legendary ghost of the forest that harms any who comes . With all of these great possibilities it could be any one ! So you know things happened in this film but did it really ? Well yes and no . Everything you saw didn't happen but when the movie is over then it will ! You see , she was psychic and nobody knew it , not even her . I hope when you see it you'll understand it because it is a good film . Stacy Keach and Billy Dee Williams are good in this film but their parts could have been larger . By the way , Keep your eye on the beast at all times , when it runs and hope the camera follows it and the beast constantly growls and makes noises and shows its teeth . I was laughing the whole time . Its just funny . Rent this and see for yourself . Its a fair movie its just that it takes a lot of patience to get use to this type of film , thats all . I rented Fear Runs Silent and gave the film another chance . The results was that I was confused even more this time . I had no problem with the cast at all as they gave all their effort for what they were given . The scene with the couple in car that was having problems in the snow had big time potential . The movie would have been a great one if it was just about the field trip and the happenings there instead of the confusing subplot with the girl's bad memories or nightmares .

639,"Text1: Raise your hand with pride if your country of origin is Belgium , just like this utterly brilliant ( ahem ? ) and obscure horror movie ! What ? No response ? Well , that's understandable because this movie is , in fact , a complete turkey and probably our country's worst export-product since that cargo of poisoned chocolates . Perhaps if you lived in Belgium all your life and grew up watching all the lackadaisical TV-shows of the 80's , you can still somewhat enjoy the stereotypes and typical clichés , but the awful script has absolutely nothing to offer to foreign horror fans . "" The Pencil Murders "" is Belgium's very own attempt to make a giallo . This magnificent sub genre is pretty much monopolized by the Italian horror industry , as they brought forward numerous compelling murder-mysteries with convoluted plots , fascinating killers and some of the world's most ingenious red herrings . "" The Pencil Murders "" is an extremely primitive imitation of the Italian giallo . Oh yes , there's a demented killer on the loose in the big city and the local police detective faces enormous difficulties to catch him / her , but that's it ! Writer / director Guy Lee Thys is completely unable to create tension or even to mislead his viewers with red herrings . The cast of characters is very limited , so you can pick out the culprit pretty early in the film . Even if you don't bother to guess along who the killer is , it's still pretty obvious and you'll pity the ' heroic ' cop for not being smarter . The only interesting element in "" The Pencil Murders "" is the killer's modus operandi . He / she carefully selects the female victims and rams a pencil up their noses and through their brains . The only thing that connects the victims is that they were all single / divorced women with the reputation of being sluts . Hence , the hunt is open for a deranged woman hater . The murders aren't as bloody as I expected ( or hoped ) and there's only a bit of sleaze , and yet this film somehow totally escaped the attention of the censorship committee ! The use of language is overall very foul and vulgar and the screenplay is unbelievably racist ! At a certain point in the film , the prime suspect is a black guy and the police promptly organize a hostile round up of every colored person in the city . The hero-cop's attitude towards the foreigners in his town is very aggressive and I hope from the bottom of my heart that this isn't an accurate portrayal of my country during the early 80's . Any police officer with such racist convictions would be taken from the job nowadays , and rightly so ! Bottom line : "" The Pencil Murders "" is a very rare and hard-to-find horror film , but that's okay , since you shouldn't look for it .

Text2:  The Dead Don't Die  is a genuinely creepy and inventive 70's made-for-TV gem that regretfully ended up in total oblivion , and this in spite of the involvement of several really highly acclaimed names in the horror industry , like writer Robert Bloch ( "" Psycho "" , "" Torture Garden "" ) , director Curtis Harrington ( "" Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ? "" , "" What's the Matter with Helen ? "" ) and a long series of veteran cast members ( Ray Milland , George Hamilton , Ralph Meeker , Reggie Nalder , ? ) . Even more impressive than the names is the screenplay's ability to actually evoke real frights and maintain a continuously unsettling atmosphere . This is story-driven suspense without fancy make-up effects or spectacular stunts , but definitely with a handful of unforgettable jump scenes like , for example , the electric chair execution near the beginning and a corpse emerging from its coffin somewhere halfway through the film . George Hamilton stars as a former sailor called back home to attend the execution of his brother Ralph for a murder he swears he didn't commit . Don vows to clear Ralph's name and find out who really committed the crime his brother got punished for . Searching in sinister places and encountering uncanny people , Don discovers that his brother wasn't actually framed for murder but merely ' selected ' for execution by an expert in the occult who wanted Ralph to serve in his army of the undead . The plot isn't exactly plausible , but nevertheless convincingly brought by cast and crew . The events supposedly take place in the 1930's and Curtis Harrington masterfully recreates the grim atmosphere of that decade with exact period details ( like vehicles and costumes ) and a cheap looking type of cinematography lacking color . Then there's also a copious amount of slick details that are just plain bizarre and indescribably eerie , like a dance hall full of near dead couples and one cute lady spontaneously combusting ! Ray Milland is terrific and reliable as always , while Reggie Nalder is one of the creepiest actors who ever lived . "" The Dead Don't Die "" comes very much recommended , if you can find a decent copy of course .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Then a pretty little country cousin shows up to complicate everything . . . This sadly neglected screwball comedy from the 1930's offers manifold delights arising from its farcical plot & wonderful cast . Only a decade of over-abundant cinematic riches could afford to forget a perfectly fine film such as this . While not a great classic of its genre , such as BRING UP BABY or NOTHING SACRED , it still has much amusement to offer the lucky viewer . Edna May Oliver & Billie Burke , both unforgettable & utterly irreplaceable , are delightful as the two stars of the film . Wisecracking , polo-playing granny Oliver , frequently found in the company of her gaggle of young men , utters sardonic comments on the plot & the behavior of the other characters . Vague , fluttery Burke , perpetually in a state of mental abstraction , adds her own brand of kookiness to the story line . Olympic medalist Buster Crabbe is hilarious , spoofing himself as a champion swimmer who wears nothing but swimming trunks the entire film , even while attending a fancy garden wedding .

641,"Text1: This played at a suburban cinema in my town back in 1978 when I was in high school . Back then they were sneaking foreign films from the city into the suburbs hoping to broaden their audiences ( it didn't work ) . I remember fighting with the ticket lady to get in . It didn't have a rating originally but the theatre gave it an R on its own . When I pointed out that that was illegal ( I was bluffing - - I have no idea if it was legal or not ) she quickly gave me the ticket . The movie wasn't THAT bad - - there's only some pretty tame female nudity here and there . As the the content I have never forgotten the first scene when the main character is in a beautiful forest enjoying the sunshine and birds - - and then comes upon the bloody mutilated body of a little girl . The juxtaposition of beauty and horror shocked me and that scene has never left me . That aside I found the film quite funny - - I didn't try to understand what it was about . Back then I loved movies ( and still do ) and just saw anything I could see . The chicken coop sequence was uproarious and I found the waterfall sequence with the nude teenagers quite beautiful . I haven't seen this film since 1978 ( that's when it opened in the U . S . ) and I'm afraid to . I don't think it will live up to my memories . Still , if you get a chance , I do recommend this movie .

642,"Text1: Harry Ward , a miner who gained notoriety for killing the men with him after a mine collapsed so that he could have further air , slaughters an entire hospital staff before returning to the scene of the crime , claiming the lives of partying teens , before being shot by then-sheriff , Burke ( Tom Atkins ) as he was about to murder Tom Hanniger ( Jensen Ackles ) . Ten years pass and Tom returns home days after his father's funeral ( . . the man who owned the mine ) on the verge of signing away the mine to outside contractors , in a sense selling the nearby town's livelihood in the process . Murders begin again , as a psychopath donning a miner's outfit and gas mask destroys victims with a pick-axe . Tom is an obvious suspect since the murders didn't start up until he returned from wherever he was at for a decade ( . . a great portion of this time is an important plot-point I won't reveal ) . A complicated love-triangle develops as Tom's former girlfriend , Sarah ( Jaime King ) , is now married to Axel ( Kerr Smith ) , the sheriff of the town . . Axel was in love with Sarah when she was dating Tom , and this unease that exists when all three are together after so long is of significance to the overall plot as this film continues . Formula slasher , extremely well made with all the Hollywood extravagances on display . I think the film lives and dies on it's 3 D gimmick and cashes in on the exhilaration of what such effects bring to an audience in search of entertainment . I don't , however , expect such a film to have legs once the gimmick is removed and those who left the theater experiencing weapons and body parts flying at them from the screen , will probably revisit it and realize that it isn't much more than that . I was certainly joyfully surprised to see such grisly violence on display , but the gore is mostly used during the 3 D process such as when an eyeball pops out of a head or a lower jaw is pulled apart . The film is essentially a series of chases between the psycho miner and victims fleeing for their lives . The costume and mask still delivers like in the original film and that pickaxe is used effectively . There are some hideous displays of carnage , the aftermath of the killer's attacks , with victims ' chests ripped open , and hearts in candy boxes . Startling sequence featuring Betsy Rue in full frontal nudity , reacting negatively to a trucker who taped them having sex in a cheap hotel . Many of the set pieces are expertly crafted such as the supermarket chase where the killer stalks Sarah and her check-out girl , Megan ( Megan Boone ; who is secretly having an affair with Axel ) throughout and a homage to the original film has miner outfits falling down as Sarah attempts to get away from the killer who follows her into a mine tunnel . I don't think many will be surprised at who the killer is ; you'd have to be pretty dense not to recognize it right away . The pickaxe is used as the primary weapon often in 3 D coming towards the screen . Great seeing vets , Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe ( . . as old miner , Ben Foley , a good friend of Tom's father ) showing up in the movie , providing the film with memorable exits . I couldn't take Kerr Smith serious as a town sheriff , he's just a bit too young and heading a criminal investigation of a serial killer , Axel seems just a bit too immature and volatile for an old-school mining town to tolerate as a man of authority . But , the excellent bit of casting in my mind was Jaime King as the "" final girl "" . . her scene alone , awestruck at seeing her old beau , Tom , again after a decade shows the richness of such a performance . I think King is the glue that holds this cast together , and provides a dramatic backbone that gives credence to so-so dialogue . Some bizarre moments exist such as the memorable murder of a dwarf hotel manager and the use of a mattress spring bed frame as protection .

Hanvey finds out almost instantly that the jewels were taken as part of a bet and now they have to be put back with out anyone finding out . Unfortunately things turn deadly as the butler is killed and the wrong man is on the run with only Hanvey standing between him and the chair . Much of what happens is funny . Much of what happens seems to meander out of left field , but that's okay since its the loopiness of the proceedings that make this so watchable . This isn't the greatest film ever made but it is a good one that is far from run of the mill . I recommend this , especially if you've become tired of all of the other detective programmers of the 30's and 40's .

The play Michael decides to do is Terrence McNally's "" Frankie and Johnnie in the Clair de Lune "" , a work that seems to be perfect . That's where the problems start . Having received an IRS refund , Mr . Pressman thinks he can invest that money into a modest production . Little does he know that what starts as a fun incursion into the theater , ends up costing four times as first envisioned . First thing that goes wrong is the casting of Alan Rosenberg as Johnnie .

When they begin reading the play , it becomes clear that Alan wants to improvise . After that , he has trouble remembering his lines and finally , his ego gets the best of him and he decides the play is not for him , leaving Michael and Lisa hanging and in debt . After the fiasco he experienced , Michael decides to play Johnnie himself . The play will finally is seen . In a hilarious sequence , Cynthia , the company manager , is seen at the box office trying to deal with the invited crowd on opening night . Kathy Baker , the actress , who has four tickets waiting , gives her name , but Cynthia looks under Bates , as in Kathy , who happens to be the one that played Frankie in the New York production . A few other familiar faces are seen as well . Jilian Armenante does a fine job with her Cynthia . Best of all in the film is Alan Rosenberg , whose own take on what the actor he is supposed to play , must be a composite of other actors he , and Mr . Pressman have met during their years in show business . Lisa Chess is wonderful as Frankie . She is a beautiful woman who should be seen more often . Michael Pressman , playing himself , gives the right tone to a director that lives to regret his involvement in the theater . Others that appear briefly are , Mandy Patinkin , Stephen Tobolowsky , Leslie Moonves , David Kelley , and Hector Elizondo , among others .

Text2: Let it be known - The Enemy Within is not great art . But it does come close to being a great Star Trek episode . Mostly because , in a way , splits down the path of William Shatner as an actor , or how much of an actor he can ever be . After a faulty teleportation back up to ship , ol Kirk is now two , with a doppelganger that beats people to a pulp and makes crude sexual advances to a worker on the ship ( probably one of the first instances of attempted rape shown on prime-time TV at the time ) , while the other ' real ' Kirk has lost his will to lead - he's unable to make decisions because his ' evil ' side is really the one that takes charge to lead . But what to do as Soolu is stuck on an icy planet ? This is all the stuff of pot-boilers , where you keep watching just to see what will make the Kirk's tick - or not - next . It's utterly classic comedy ( maybe unintentionally so , maybe meaning to be ) as ' evil ' Kirk tries to take over the ship incognito , but gets caught when he tries to get the ship away from Soolu and the others ! But then there's the existential crisis of ' good ' Kirk , as he doesn't have any real resolve as a leader , except in regards to putting himself , literally it seems , back together . In a way it's kind of trashy , and I could see why one or two Trekkies might find it sub-par . But it does give Shatner lots of freedom as an actor , unlike most of the time where he inspires the best in imitators , and I liked the dichotomy of the psychology present , even as dated as it is . How does one balance the good with the bad ? Control , it seems , at least is you're James Tiberius Kirk - which includes libido .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

"" Lee Bowman plays a crooked politician pretending to be a good guy , and as a result , he's eager to see an innocent man put away for murder . He also is after the aforementioned Mitchell , who is waiting around for Heflin to make a move . Hunt's role is somewhat dated ( or maybe not ) - she's on her way to becoming a good forensics person , but says that the job is not for a woman and she wants to get married . Evidently that will put an end to her career . Heflin was an interesting actor who could do character roles and leads . This film was made around the time of his breakthrough role in "" Johnny Eager , "" after which he hung up his B movie mantle and moved on to bigger things . He always brought wry humor and subtle characterizations to his roles as well as excellent timing . Lee Bowman was a mustached actor who looked like he came from the Warren William era . He's solid but not terribly exciting . Hunt brings warmth and sparkle to her role . There was , in my opinion , a major problem with the plot having to do with Heflin testing to find particles in the hair of various suspects some time after the crime - wouldn't the particles have come out when they washed their hair ? You really end up thinking no one ever took a shower . Nice beginning for Zinnemann , who would go on to direct some big features such as "" High Noon . ""

Apley is a stuffed shirt whose well-ordered family is suddenly not so well-ordered . His son ( Richard Ney ) is dating a girl from Worcester , which is seen by Apley as being someplace like the Black Hole of Calcutta , and his daughter ( Cummins ) loves a Yale man who lectures that Emerson was a radical . At first , George takes a firm stand , then relents at the behest of his understanding friend , who saw George give up the woman he loved 30 years earlier . When the Worcester girl's father actually rejects the Apley family , George rethinks his position . His daughter is sent to Europe to get away from her boyfriend , and his son is betrothed to his cousin ( Brown ) . Imagine going to Broadway shows in the ' 20s and ' 30s and attending one class-conscious play after another . Before the Depression , the sets were drawing rooms , the clothing was formal , everyone had British accents , and the plots had to do with the crossing of the classes . Frankly , I'm glad they finally intermingled . Ronald Colman is marvelous as George , and one sees his confusion , pain , and remembrance of the past on his face . He's a very sympathetic character . Peggy Cummins is very pretty and Richard Ney is nice-looking . Vanessa Brown , as the dowdy cousin , gives a sweet performance , and her story arc is very satisfying . If you're a fan of Ronald Colman , as I am , this is a good movie to see . Also , if you know Boston at all , you'll find hearing the street names interesting . Otherwise , it's a mildly interesting period piece that most people will find relating to difficult .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Now known almost entirely as High Priest Imhotep from the Mummy movies , Vosloo has certainly proved his ability to act with much of his face missing . So here was my problem with Darkman II ? first of all there's no way that Durant could have survived the crash and come out of it with nothing more than some scars on his face and neck . That crash destroyed and then incinerated his body . Larry Drake is a tremendously talented villain actor , but if anything they should have created another villain . That , after all , was Westlake's reason for living at the end of the first film , to fight crime . Another villain would have been a perfect excuse for another Darkman . Resurrecting Durant is not . That being said , another major problem is that Durant's casual smugness is no longer amusing or entertaining . It's not fun or interesting anymore to see him constantly talking to people that he's about to kill as though he thinks it's the funniest thing in the world . His whole sarcastic demeanor gets real old real quick . ( spoilers ) Westlake meets another scientist , David Brinkman , working on the same formula for synthetic skin that he has been trying to figure out , and Brinkman has made huge improvements , turning the 99 minute barrier into I think the 138 minute barrier , a huge step in their studies . Brinkman proposes a partnership , which Westlake eagerly accepts . Sadly , Brinkman happens to live in a huge warehouse that Durant wants to buy in order to set up the headquarters in which to pursue his endeavors for developing a nuclear handgun , but Brinkman doesn't want to sell . The expected ' convincing ' ends in Brinkman's death , and Westlake has to suffer through the loss of another partner . So not only do they resurrect the same villain from the first movie , they even cut and pasted the plot . Yawn . There's another subplot involving the death of a stupid , stupid TV reporter , eager to have a hit story to help her career but oblivious or indifferent to the dangers that it would put on her ability to remain alive . She doesn't believe at first that Durant is really alive , but when evidence seems to suggest that he is , she wants to be the first to break the story . My favorite little trick was how Durant managed to get a bomb into her car literally minutes after she breaks the story about him on live TV . She talks to the camera , then walks outside and explodes . A criminal who can work THAT fast DESERVES to monopolize all crime in the city . The movie is plagued with horrific acting , particularly on the part of Durant's idiot sidekicks , who act just as dumb as their characters are supposed to be . There is nothing new covered here other than the same villain pursuing a different avenue of high level crime , and Vosloo delivers a respectable performance taking over for Liam Neeson , but Neeson owns this character just like Sam Raimi owns the picture itself . His work is far too recognizable to be taken over without losing a lot of the original feel of the film , and it's too bad that Durant exploded at the end of the first movie but apparently survived unscathed , while Darkman suffered no injury other than that at the very beginning , and yet it's him that is an entirely different person . Given the extensive level of disappointment that this movie delivers , I'm curious as to why they bothered with a Darkman III . I guess SOMEONE must have liked it ?

Text2: 1998 was one of the most controversial years ever as far as the Best Picture Oscar winner , but I think that this is only because Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love , the two front-runners for the award , were both such tremendously spectacular movies . There was a similar situation the year before , in 1997 , with the rivalry between Titanic and As Good As It Gets , it's just too bad that the Academy chose to give the award to Titanic's ticket sales rather than the sheer earthquaking quality of As Good As It Gets and the fabulous talent within it . Thankfully , the Best Actor and Best Female Actor awards were given to the stars of As Good As It Gets , clearly showing that the Academy realizes that the content was in As Good As It Gets , but chose instead to award the financial purging and pretty pictures and sparkly oohs and aahs that were in Titanic . The Oscars , it becomes clearer and clearer , are entirely a commercial event and have little to nothing to do with furthering film as an artistic medium . 1998 , then , may be seen as something of an apology , where the Academy tries to show that they know about good film beyond goofy romantic set pieces like the joke that Titanic has turned out to be , but unfortunately in 1998 they awarded a worthy film but had to also turn down another equally worthy film . Like I always say , though , movies are not a stratified medium that releases one great film every year and a lot of pretty good movies every year so that the Oscars can be neatly distributed and we can all go home smiling , which is why I don't involve myself too much in who gets what Oscar , but rather watch the Academy Awards for entertainment purposes and , most of all , to develop a list of the quality films that I missed during the year . I wish people wouldn't get so freaked out about it and just enjoy the show , because it is quite often these same people that go out and pay full ticket prices for crap like Big Momma's House and Gone In 60 Seconds and the Scary Movies and whatnot . We have a consumer responsibility people ! These trashy movies keep getting made because someone keeps buying tickets to see them ! Who are these people ? ? But I digress . As Good As It Gets , as the title refers , is just about as good as human interest dramas get . I have read reviews complaining that Melvin ( the mentally flawed character played flawlessly by Jack Nicholson ) is a man who it is impossible to like or love , whose compulsive , antisocial behavior is sad and disturbing , neither cute nor funny , to put it in the words of one of these unsatisfied reviewers , Christopher Brown , my colleague and good friend . Quite the contrary , however , Melvin Udall is a man who suffers from obsessive compulsion , severe antisocial tendencies , and whose interaction with the world , like Vincent Gallo's Billy in Buffalo ' 66 , is limited to harsh insults intended to harm . I think it's true that the character is presented in such a way that he doesn't seem to realize how hurtful his statements can be ( such as in the diner scene when he makes a touchy comment to Carol ( Helen Hunt ) about her son . The major flaw of the film is that the plot boils down to a fairly familiar formula , in which the man who hates everyone he comes into contact on a daily basis softens and ultimately grows to accept everyone from women and children to his gay neighbor's dog . Given the fact that the film is peppered with high priced Hollywood movie stars ( Jack Nicholson , Helen Hunt , Greg Kinnear , Cuba Gooding , Jr . , etc . ) , it's obvious that it's not a cheap production , so the crowds have to be pleased to some extent , but even the rather conventional path that it follows to the end is made into a tremendously enjoyable ride because of the quality of the performances . You can clearly see the difference between where the money goes in a movie like this and a movie like Titanic . You can either have enormous special effects and fancy cinematic trickery dumbed down by wooden performances , as was the case in Titanic , or you can have a movie that takes place in a familiar setting and is bursting with Oscar worthy performances from top to bottom , as in As Good As It Gets . That being said , I am willing to forgive a little bit of bending to the crowd-pleasing formula , which is something that I generally hate more than anything else because it is so rarely done right . Most producers ( Jerry Bruckheimer ) try so hard to please so many different people that they end up pleasing no one at all . In this film , the conventional formula is the price that we have to pay to see the quality of the performances and the story . Clearly , no one but Jack Nicholson could play a character like Melvin and still be liked by the audience , so his character is a success despite the callousness of him as a person . I can understand that there are a lot of people who may have been put off by a purely superficial look at the movie , maybe they couldn't look past Melvin's insults or maybe they weren't satisfied by the ending , which left very open the possibility that the future would hold more trouble like we had already seen up to that point in the movie ( I felt this way myself , to a certain extent ) , but there can be no denying the enormous quality of the film and it's inarguable superiority to Titanic . As Good As It Gets is such a fun movie that it's almost hard to see how anyone could not like it , unless maybe they were in bad mood when they watched it . If you are one of these people , I would advise you to watch it again and pay close attention to Melvin's character throughout the film . You may be able to profit from his lessons .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: This is only the second of Dario Argento's films I've seen , but I found it quite enjoyable , and I'll definitely look for other films by him ( not something I felt like after watching the other film by him I saw , Creepers ) . The film is a salute to Argento's idol , Alfred Hitchcock , and contains homages to several of his films . It's about a guy who sees two girls meeting and discussing the plot of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train briefly , and then someone close to one of the girls die . Has the two girls switched murders , like it happened in the very film they discussed ? The plot is a playful mix of Strangers on a Train and Rear Window , with some parts inspired by other Hitchcock masterpieces . The pace is pretty good , though it drags at some points in the film . Like Hitchcock , Argento manages to create some excellent suspense . The gore isn't as shocking or gratuitous as what I understand most of Argento's film contain , but it's good considering that it's a TV-film . There's also a fair bit of nudity . This fact will no doubt deter some possible viewers , and draw others . The acting is fairly good , for the most part , though there are a few scenes where the acting is embarrassing , even by TV-movie standards . The characters are credible and interesting , though a few of them seem written in just to make room for a few twists near the end , and at some points , the characters seemed completely illogical to me ( but this may be an issue of cultural differences . . . this may be typical for Italians , in other words , but I've never seen people act like that ) . All in all , a fun little film , good for fans of either or both directors , but not really something you'll want to watch more than once or twice . I recommend this to fans of Dario Argento and / or Alfred Hitchcock . Check it out if the plot grabs your attention . Chances are , you won't regret it . I certainly didn't .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: Say what you like about the Bond franchise ( And in my opinion I don't have a lot of good things to say ) but the series never came out with the old cliche of having those nasty pinko commies as the bad guys . Bond's enemies where always the fictional SPECTRE or mad scientist types , not that this was always successful of course . But I did enjoy the ironic fact that this new Bond starts his first filmed mission with an attack on a secret USSR base . Even better in this respect is the title sequence where we see the demise of communist icons and as the story progresses we find out the bad guys are ex-communists turned quasi mafia , and the motivation of the main baddie involves a cold war betrayal . All this gives GOLDENEYE a sense of time and place , something that can't be said for most - If any - Bond films . GOLDENEYE is a very good Bond film even if it's not up to classics like DR NO or GOLDFINGER . The production values are certainly a million times better than what we saw in the 80s . Brosnan is fairly good but lacks that serious touch that Dalton and Connery had . The only other complaint I have is that tank sequence which is very silly and interferes with the pace of the film . The one thing that puzzled me though is the main villain . He's played by an actor far too young to have born in the 1940s . I know Anthony Hopkins was to have been originally cast in this role but if that was the case would he have been required to have a really brutal punch up with Bond at the climax ?","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: This is one of those anime movies I first saw on regular television . It was very cool and unique and started my love affair with these types of cartoons . The only other anime movie I saw before this one was one called in English "" Warriors of the Wind "" . I saw that one when I was a bit young though and I didn't know what was going on so I can not really review it . I remember it being rather good though . The reason I like this one though is that it is sort of the old plot of a man going against vampires and wolfman and all sorts of other supernatural creatures , but there is a bit of a futuristic twist that I rather like . The story has a girl bitten by a vampire and destined to become his bride . She is in luck though as a vampire hunter named D has come to town . This guy really is a good fighter and he uses every trick in the book to take down the evil in the castle . He has a rather unique sidekick as well . Twists and turns abound in the movie as do betrayals and vengeance . This one has it all and some great animation and action as well .

The premise is so simple and so effective that it's amazing that they haven't been making movies like this for years . Or maybe they have . But definitely none have been as well done as this . The story involves a brilliant mirror image in the crime and law enforcement world - the police force assigns a promising new recruit to enter the crime world and live there for years as a mole , meanwhile a crime boss has assigned a young gangster to join the police academy and become a legitimate cop , living inside the force for years as a mole . I watched Infernal Affairs at the same time as I was reading a thick biography of Chairman Mao and while living in China , so I've been reading a lot about undercover moles and their seemingly endless use throughout modern Chinese history , and this movie gives a brilliant on screen example . The development of the plot and story are by far the most interesting thing about the movie . Lau is the mobster living as a police officer , and Chan is the police recruit living undercover as a criminal . Lau is flourishing as a policeman , while Chan is growing increasingly desperate as a criminal , since as the years pass he finds that he is more and more simply becoming the role he is playing , and he grows increasingly desperate to get out . Unfortunately , the force has invested years in him as a criminal , so they refuse to let him out . Before long , a mole is suspected in the force , and sure enough , Lau , the mole himself , is assigned to find it . This puts him in a curious position . He can either continue to fail to find the mole , or he can frame one of his colleagues . Soon both characters are aware of each other , but not each other's identity , and there is a lengthy use of cell-phones to create a complex web of tension , as each is on the verge of discovering the identity of the other , or get discovered himself . A more thorough and effective recipe for genuine tension is difficult to come by ! Then there is the issue of each man playing a different identity for so long . There is a deeper emotional and moral complexity to this film than most crime films , American , Chinese or otherwise . It's a brilliant composition of dichotomies and contradictions , mirror images and switches personalities , and makes for a hell of a ride .

The other girl , Flavia , is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her . That's really about it . In reality , nothing much happens and the film drags on and on as Veronica attempts to terrorize and dominate Flavia . One commenter on IMDb described it as "" the scariest film in 80's Mexican cinema "" . My comment ? if that's the case , there must not have been many horror films made in Mexico in the 80s . Another commenter wrote , "" Watch it if you wanna get scared . "" My comment ? are you sure we're talking about the same movie ? My opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples I've given .

Veronica and Flavia carry-on long , drawn-out conversations with members of their families and their teacher , but we never actually see these peoples ' faces . It's an annoying gimmick .

Text2: When Hammer began their horror cycle in the 50s , they were smart to begin with what are essentially remakes of two of Universal's most well known and successful films ? Frankenstein and Dracula . Hammer may have started the ball rolling with The Curse of Frankenstein , but to me , Hammer's second , The Horror of Dracula , is the best movie Hammer made and a vast improvement over Universal's iconic Dracula . Why do I call The Horror of Dracula Hammer's best and an improvement Universal's film ? Three things immediately come to mind ? Christopher Lee , Peter Cushing , and the screenplay and direction . While Bela Lugosi may be a more familiar face to the average movie fan , I've always felt that Lee took what Lugosi did and improved on it . The image of Lee with his bloodshot eyes and bared , bloody fangs is a more frightening visage to me than Lugosi's stare . Lee brought athleticism and vitality to the role . He made Dracula a real physical threat . In short , he made Dracula threatening . As with Lee vs . Lugosi , Peter Cushing is an improvement over Edward Van Sloan in the role of Van Helsing . The difference is that here the improvement is more apparent and undeniable . Face it , Sloan was a stiff . As interesting as some of his characters ideas may have been , I could never picture the man doing any real battle with a vampire . Cushing , on the other hand , is a whirlwind of activity . He has the same interesting ideas about vampire folklore , but with a physical presence that can actually stand-up to Dracula . In short , Cushing simply is Van Helsing . Finally , I enjoy the screenplay and direction of The Horror of Dracula more than that of Dracula . Why ? Too much of Dracula seems stage-bound . Everything and everyone seems confined to whatever set they happen to be on . It also doesn't help that much of the direction in Dracula is of the "" plant and shoot "" variety . I realize that this was the case with many early films , but that doesn't mean I like it . In The Horror of Dracula , characters don't feel as confined . Terence Fisher gives the actors the freedom to move . You get the impression that the characters come and go at will . It may be an unfair comparison for movies made some 27 years apart , but this has always been one of my biggest complaints with Dracula . ( For the record , I don't have this problem with most of Universal's other classic films like Frankenstein or The Invisible Man , to give just two examples . ) Hammer made many horror films over the years that I consider to be among my favorites . But none equal The Horror of Dracula . I realize that all I've done here is compare two different versions of the same story , but the comparisons are the best way I can think of to express what I like about Hammer's film . In this day and age of bad horror remakes , it's a little odd to me that my favorite Hammer film is a remake .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

It seems clear that Jacob Berger , himself the son of a noted writer , is attempting to work through his own hang-ups via a movie and the consensus appears to be , fine , go right ahead BUT make sure you don't forget the movie part . Alas , it wasn't to be so what we have is a mish-mosh at best . It's possible that Berger was aiming for irony in making the leading character a Nobel prize-winner but a total failure at fatherhood ; the message seems to be why not aim at winning a prize for parenting and THEN think of competing for the Dynamite money . Contrary to what is on display here Guillaume Depardieu can actually act better than this , not much maybe but certainly a little , I know , because I've seen him but if this were his first film he'd probably never get another unless he financed it himself . Sylvie Testud is under used and given little to do except personify angst but as always she does it as well as it can be done . Other than that . . . well , what do you want for five euros .

The red-headed singer goes through almost anything here-admitting to murder , then denying it and that story of having a child with another guy is too much to bear . The performances have no zest whatsoever . The guessing game seems to go nowhere as well . At least , the 3 performers should have done some singing so as to liven up this very unimaginative movie .

661,"Text1: This tribute to Russian resistance in World War II gave Gregory Peck his opportunity for a starring film screen debut . No walk-ons , or bit parts are in Peck's career resume . He was billed a star from the beginning . Not that Days of Glory was the greatest of debuts . In fact it was only in his second film , The Keys of the Kingdom for which he got his first Oscar nomination that made him a big star . Still Peck as the stoic and brooding Russian peasant resistance leader certainly had star quality written all over him . Now that the Cold War is over we can appreciate the Russian contribution to defeating Nazism without getting hung up over Communism . The Russians took a quick study in what defeated Napoleon and applied those lessons to World War II . Where you see the German Army in the Ukraine in Days of Glory is roughly how far they advanced into the Soviet Union . Those partisans that Peck heads are on the cutting edge as factories are being transported and rebuilt in the Urals and east of same and the Red Army is being reorganized . Joe Stalin is also looking a military leadership team to beat the Nazis . The Russian people took a tremendous toll and it was the great worry of both Roosevelt and Churchill up to the Allied invasion of Normandy that Stalin might just make a separate peace . If he had the world would be very different . Peck's love interest was dancer Tamara Toumanova who plays a dancer caught up in the partisan movement . As an actress she's a great dancer , she's seen to better advantage in Alfred Hitchcock's Torn Curtain where she concentrates on dancing . Days of Glory did get an Oscar nomination for Special Effects , but despite that it's essentially an A picture from a B picture studio , RKO . Still it's not a bad last stand story and a decent enough debut for Gregory Peck .

Text2: A really good film could be made about the making of Cry , the Beloved Country which in itself is a landmark film about the early stages of the formal apartheid society in the Union of South Africa . There's a famous story of Alfred Hitchcock shooting the scene with Cary Grant fleeing the United Nations on the sly with a hidden camera because the UN would not grant him permission to film . That's nothing to what Zoltan Korda had to just even getting Canada Lee and young Sidney Poitier into South Africa in the guise of houseboys . He filmed all the outdoor stuff on location there and the government never caught on . Had they caught on it might have meant prison , it certainly at a minimum would have resulted in deportation . , Canada Lee plays Reverend Stephen Kumalo who comes to Johannesburg in search of his missing son Absalom . Another man of the cloth , Sidney Poitier helps him search for his son who among other things has gotten a woman pregnant and has committed murder during a robbery attempt in a fit of panic . The rest of the story is not a pleasant one , but strangely uplifting as Lee , father of the murderer and the father of the victim who was a liberal South African fighting the apartheid regime pledge mutually out of their grief to work for a just society . It took a long time and it's not all together there yet , but South Africa is one of the great success stories of the past century about people of good will righting terrible wrongs . Alan Paton the author was a prophet with no honor in his own country . His book , a world best seller , was banned in the Union of South Africa and Paton himself ostracized . Paton was a committed Christian who really did believe that all people were indeed equal and fought for that ideal all his life . He died in the mid eighties and sadly did not live to see the fall of apartheid . Though a big budget film of Cry , the Beloved Country came out in the nineties , this time with the cooperation of the Mandela government , this film still sets a high standard just for courage in the making .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
662,"Text1: In 1977 , Megumi Yokota vanished without a trace . For 20 years her family had tried to search for an answer , but found nothing , until it was revealed that she was amongst those who were abducted by North Korean spies . The screening today opened with a video address dated in August 2007 by her parents . In it , they shared their experience in dealing with the shock , their efforts , and of course , their steely resolve in hoping that their daughter will be returned to them one day . Containing an ode to Megumi , it was a relatively short video address , but one which I thought summarized the entire movie succinctly . It's an understatement to say that kidnapping is terrible , for both the victim and the parents . But one done without a ransom provided , leaves little clues to the parents , and here , sparked off intense sorrow that I'm sure any parent can identify with - the love and effort in raising a child , now so suddenly taken away with you , with zero trace . There's absolutely nothing to fall back on - no motive , no eyewitnesses , no prior abnormal behaviour noticed , nothing . This documentary charts the 30 years of the time of the abduction until now . It tells of the journey and struggles of Megumi's parents , but provides as a launchpad , an introduction into a mystery unravelled . While the act of kidnapping itself might seem one-off and random , but the putting together of little facts gathered throughout Japan by investigative journalists provided the bigger picture , and ultimately , the ability to point a finger , suggest motives , and seek closure . But closure is something not easy to come by . For those who have been following press reports in recent years , you might have read a bit about the incidents starting from Japan's ex-Prime Minister Koizumi's historic visit to North Korea , and the release of some of the abductees in return for food and medical aid . Diplomacy seemed to be the best , and the only course , for Japan to engage North Korea . North Korea has shown that it doesn't negotiate easily , and it tends to flip flop around given its poor track record and ambiguous and conflicting , unconvincing evidences . Abduction managed to piece together a compelling narrative , and at some times , horrifying too , at how random and perhaps senseless these acts are . But it does suggest some reasons why these Japanese were abducted , and mostly for espionage and training reasons , which seemed highly plausible . What was suspect though , and also not probed in depth , was interviews with the returned abductees . I thought that given it managed to talk to a North Korean defector , it would also be able to get those folks to open up . But perhaps they do not want to talk about their ordeal , or that it's classified information for confidential debriefing only , or like they mentioned , to ensure the safety of those still held by NOrth Korea , one will never know . On a more personal scale , it charts the emotional turmoil and immense efforts by Megumi's parents to champion for the return of their daughter . Red herring , doctored evidence , and even something that should provide the most compelling evidence by far were all rebutted . It's understandable , and the documentary seemed to support and debunk whatever evidence that turns up . There's nothing like parents love , and this film captured all that . 30 years of hope and continued fighting for the truth shows all that . And it is their personal wish that these atrocities are made known to as many people as possible .

663,"Text1: A cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films . The trail leads the mother all over Europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep . This is one of the countless soft-core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill . Personally I'd rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing . This is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not . Mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead . Periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of S & M to the proceedings . The violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement , its all so incredibly fake . Worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting . ( Basically par for the course for many of these films ) You'll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that I stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur , but there was nothing . The most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a Buick . I watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery , not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller .

Text2: The problem with High Def TVs and old films is perfectly shown by BEAST FROM HOLLOW MOUNTAIN , this was , I think , Willis O'Brien's last film . An old school movie that predates Harryhausen's Valley or Gwangi , its about a T-Rex loose in Mexico . Painfully dull until the monster begins the rampage ( I mean PAINFUL ) the film really isn't that good . The monster isn't much better than what O'Brien did in the Lost World or King Kong . Clearly his better days were past him as the effects , while serviceable look no better and no more realistic than what many amateur film makers cranked out ( look at the end of the monster in the swamp and be appalled . ) The problem is that in High Def the color photography goes wildly grainy when you get the process shots combining the animated monster and the real people . Its awful looking almost like a blizzard .

664,"Text1: The Reaper virus devastated a portion of Scotland with England building a steel , reinforced barrier splitting apart Great Britain . With signs of the Reaper virus reawakening in London , and the photographic evidence of those who have survived on the opposite side , quarantined away from "" civilization "" , the British government ( . . or what's left of it ) desires for a commando unit , led by someone of great skill and leadership ( . . able enough to pull off such a difficult , seemingly impossible feat ) , to find the cure which has allowed those uninfected to survive where the Reaper virus had ran rampant . Selected to lead the team is one-eyed Major Eden Sinclair ( Rhona Mitra ) , a skilled marksman with no fear , always calculating her next move , with an ability to handle chaos when others might falter . She is seen at the opening as the little girl whose eye was shot by a soldier with a hair trigger and is sent away by her mother on board a helicopter to safety as the madness of frightened citizens seeking refuge from being quarantined are all around her . Eden wears a high-tech eye which works as a video recording device and camera . She also has a watch which feeds her information from the eye . The soldiers under her wear the typically black hi-tech gear and carry the elaborate rifles able to blast the enemy with range and precision . They enter the quarantined Scotland inside armored tank-vehicles with security cameras and weaponry equipped to handle an army of marauders and savages as the case will soon become . They encounter a society of leather-clad , immoral cannibalistic , barbaric punks with mohawks , facial make-up , and piercings , a direct representation of a world gone terribly wrong it seems . They seem to have a singular mission , to harm and destroy , and those who decide to infiltrate "" their city "" are slaughtered . Eden and her commandos ( . . or those left after the savages pick them apart ) are to find a Doctor Marcus Kane ( Malcolm McDowell , whose chilling narration opens the film , informing the viewers of the horrifying future as it unfolded before the true plot forges ahead ) who was working on a cure before murder and mayhem arises having him flee with men elsewhere . Kane's son , Sol ( Craig Conway , letting it hall hang out ) , is the psychotic leader of his fanatical army , actually holding his decent and scared sister , Cally ( MyAnna Buring ) prisoner , planning much worse for Eden . Cally knows where Kane is and will lead Eden to his location . What lies in wait for Eden is a now diabolically mad Kane , who has built a new life for himself and those who followed him out of Sol's city , living within the confines of a medieval castle fortress , adopting a new type of civilization away from the past , isolated from the memories of yore , building an empire which threatens anyone from the other side . Obviously director Neil Marshall was inspired by his beloved influences , creating a wonderfully wicked hodgepodge of Escape from New York , The Road Warrior and 28 Days Later . . This will be considered a travesty by some , ripping off films from the past , but I saw it differently , working more as a homage , gloriously embedding the viewer into a harsh climate of violence and despair , a grim post-apocalyptic nightmare where all hope seems lost and only the mad or infinitely corrupt survive . Eden is a symbol of strength , fortitude , smarts , and cool . . a charismatic and formidable opponent towards those who wish nothing but hostility and death towards those they consider responsible for the pitiful conditions brought on by circumstances out of control . Those abandoned and left for dead cry out by inflicting misery on outsiders who pose a threat to their way of life and purpose . Featuring a Reaper virus quite similar to the one released by the monkey in 28 Days Later . . Eden is a female equivalent of Snake Plisskin , even missing an eye and wearing a patch ( . . and has a locater device which is smashed to pieces not longer after entering the quarantined zone ) And Sol's punks are very reminiscent to the violent freaks and weirdos from The Road Warrior . There's something quite surreal about seeing an action heroine facing off with a vicious punk one moment , and a massive soldier in gladiatorial combat within a suit of armour , not long after . One moment freaks on motorcycles and a graffiti-covered beat-up bus ( hearkening back to Hill's The Warriors ) are after Eden , the next Kane's men on horseback with a suit of armour , swords in hand , with archers equipped with a bow and arrows . Then the masterfully designed chase on the open roads as Sol's gang ( . . in modified vehicles featuring their deranged style ) are after Eden and company ( . . driving a Bentley they found in an abandoned warehouse ) featuring bristling scenes where crashes are imminent , across a gorgeous picturesque countryside with winding roads . Bashed in heads , a bunny rabbit blown to bits by an automatic machine gun , a victim cooked over an open fire as Sol's people celebrate a cannibalistic feast , imaginative beheadings galore . . lots of ultra-violence in store for those who crave such things . Marshall adopts modern techniques which might repel many . . quick cuts and breathlessly paced camera work are featured during the action sequences whether it be hand-to-hand combat or cars crashing into each other . Solid cast featuring Bob Hoskins as Eden's guiding influence Bill Nelson bringing his usual commanding presence to the film in an almost thankless role , Alexander Siddig as the Prime Minister , a rather spineless leader for a nation who has been abandoned by the other parts of the world , and David O'Hara as Canaris , the cold-blooded lieutenant who truly calls the shots , using his boss as a tool , just waiting to take his place . Great role for Mitra who conveys confidence and quiet swagger , also having the precise look needed to fulfill the role demanded of her . The Reaper virus is a nasty plague where humans ' faces are bombarded with hideous sores and cause the hemorrhaging of blood .

Text2: Boy , this sure doesn't hold back when casting a scathing view of the Catholic church . No stone is unturned . Everything is in this film . Duck for that kitchen sink because the hypocrisy and secrets hidden within the abbey of the church of nuns examined here is riddled with sin and deprivation . The kick is that , through Norifumi Suzuki's magnificent direction , this isn't just a cheapo exploit flick , but a legit art film . The film's protagonist , Maya , to me isn't very different that Nami , the Scorpion in the Female Prisoner film , except she infiltrates a dirty convent seeking answers regarding her mother's fate within the confines of what was supposed to be a religious community of believers . Where a dirty cop is behind the ills of Nami , a bitter priest , Father Kakinuma ( Fumio Watanabe ) is the man responsible for what ails Maya . The Priest and the Vice Abbess , a woman seething with lust running through very loins . The fact is this flick exposes the ugly truth of what could occur behind the closed walls of a hidden place secretively inactive from the outside world . Here's this modern girl , Maya ( the yummy Yumi Takigawa ) who we see enjoying the pleasantries of life before entering the repressed innards of a community harboring hidden immorality under a cloak of righteousness . She is the offspring of that very lust and sin that lies quietly buried underneath the cloak , and through her , will those iniquities be exposed . Though , when you threaten to expose hidden dirty old secrets , there are bound to be consequences . Her very life will be threatened by not only the Vice Abbess , but a "" witch-finding nun "" sent into the convent by Kakinuma to put an end to a thorn in his flesh which could finally awaken the monster he really is . Kakinuma is quite a character . . hidden underneath bushy long hair and thick mustache , not to mention this cloak which removes our eyes from a horrifying act that occurred from the past , is this menacing quiet beast who seems to be a loving man of God who any nun or God-fearing Christian could confide in when dealing with problems of the flesh , is , himself , holding rather unpleasant feelings toward everyone including the Lord he serves . He seeks answers from God ( "" Where is God when man needs him ? "" ) while constantly bedding nuns who revere him . What sins are hidden within this convent : lesbian lovers keeping their love-making secret from everyone , a Mother Superior who confiscates sex photos she masturbates to , nuns who enjoy the sight of women being whipped ( director Suzuki often pulls his camera in on their faces as they look on wide-eyed with enthusiasm ) , the persecution room ( readily used such as the case when Maya is being tortured with thorny vines twisting around her body , piercing her flesh as a nun on each side pulls with all their might ) , a nun who stole money from the Vice Abbess so that she could pay for her father's hospital bills for which she receives a rape from Kakinuma , etc . The torture scene where Maya is being treated to thorny rose vines is rather hard to watch as director Suzuki tightens the camera on how they slide back and forth underneath her breasts . But , what follows is actually both unpleasant and beautiful . . the nuns collectively slap Maya across the face with bouquets of roses as Suzuki shows her face whipping to and fro in slow motion as petals fall poetically like snow around her body . It's quite a feat to create such a scene which can alternately compel and repel . And , that whipping scene , the first one inside the infamous persecution room , is amazingly photographed as Suzuki's camera goes berserk following the action as the two nuns , caught by a spy , eating sausages . The most horrific sequence in the film , the witch-trial of a pregnant nun , who was raped by Kakinuma , is quite a dazzling moment in the film . We see her agonizingly put through the ringer , whipped with blood stripes opening on her skin , salt water poured in her mouth ( . . forced to swallow an entire pail ) , and held inside a chair as the clock ticks with this container under her legs ( with a gold crucifix at it's center ) ready for urine to flow . If she urinates , this poor soul will be condemned as a witch . Not just your run-of-the-mill nunsploit , although I'm not an expert in the subversive sub-genre , I'd be hard-pressed to expect another to be any better than this one . Lots of breasts exposed as well as unceasing stabs at Catholicism . . . there's a vehement anti-Catholic attitude that permeates throughout and use of Christian iconography ( the use of a crucifix to kill , the destruction of a Virgin Mary statuette , blood puddling down a portrait of THE LAST SUPPER ) in exploitive ways . Certainly not for all tastes . . some will find this film very offensive . Maya , an unshakable force to be reckoned with , will unleash her revenge on those responsible for her mother's demise .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
665,"Text1: First of all , let me just say how impressed I was with the first two movies in this trilogy . They were outstanding films and deserving of all the awards they received . Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie ; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two . The main reason can be summed up in one word : OVERKILL . Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one : "" King Kong , "" where the action was way too much , too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers ' intelligence . So was this film , the third in the LOTR series . It was too much action , so much that after halfway through this 3 hour , 20-minute movie I was numb by then and could care less what happened from that point . I stuck with it , but it just got worse and worse with more ridiculous action scenes going on one after the other with absolutely no credibility to any of them . Examples of what I mean regarding "" credibility "" are scenes in which humongous monsters and machines 100 times the size and strength of the "" good guys "" would always lose . Even females and little Hobbitts disposed of these-supposedly indestructible creatures , time after time . It was so Rambo-like , so stupidly juvenile it was insulting to watch . After awhile , it wasn't even entertaining . . . . the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie . To use another descriptive word , this film - like Jackson's subsequent King Kong - was EXCESSIVE . By overdoing the action , the awesome-looking creatures and the wonderful special-effects that captured the LOTR audiences for the first two movies , ended this trilogy on a sour note . Too much violence translates into "" boring . "" I also got tired of seeing a 99-percent dead "" Frodo "" somehow still managing to go on and on with these never-ending agonizing looks on his face and his little tearful buddies crying their eyes out constantly .

667,"Text1: The title tells it all - - Ed Gein , the butcher of Plainfield . It's not a zappy action-filled slasher movie made for teens high on energy drinks . That would fit it into a well-established genre , the kind that some people find entertaining , something along the lines of "" Halloween "" or "" The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "" . This is dark , slow , filled with chopped-up corpses , and quietly evil . There are few shock cuts , no monster's point-of-view shots , no loud electronic score . I don't know who it's aimed at - - ghouls , maybe . Beneath the credits we already see still photos of skulls , carcasses hung up , skins draped across the backs of chairs , that sort of thing . And they're sufficiently revolting that I couldn't help thinking this movie had better be pretty good to make up for this Grand Guignol opening . Alas , it's not . The acting is uniformly terrible , as in a high school play . The script does its best to sink below vulgarity . Ed Gein , who killed only two middle-aged women and maybe his brother , chases a screaming , bloody young woman through the Woodland of Weir , and she's wearing only a modern bra and bikini , rather than period underwear . Gein also decapitates a night watchman , which he never did in any historical sense . The direction ? You could do a better job . In the first few minutes , law officers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered all over the windshield . There is no body . The handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim , who may still be in the vicinity and living . The sheriff , lacking any motivation , shouts at him , "" Now you just FORGET that ! I don't want you going off HALF COCKED on anything ! "" It should be no more than a business-like exchange of views . Why does the director have the sheriff so angry ? Characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs - - Louis Armstrong's "" Ain't Misbehaving , "" for instance . This is - - what - - rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s ? And the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the Cotton Club in Harlem in the 30s , or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen . Nope . The radio would be playing Kitty Kallen's "" Wheel of Fortune "" or Theresa Brewer or , equally likely , Lefty Frizell . Not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of what's going on beneath the images . Someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs , that's all . Of course there's only so much you can do with a low budget , but it can be light years ahead of this butchery . See "" Ed Gein , "" with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for dead bodies , and on a budget that couldn't have exceeded this one by much .

If anyone finds this tale to be well-executed and fascinating in any way , he should try to find some insight into his tastes . It's beneath mine - - and I consider myself pretty warped .

Text2: A history of homosexuality as presented in the cinema . It makes some good points , even if some are a little obvious . As an example , Lilly Tomlin , the narrator , points out that female homosexuality seems to be a little less objectionable to the public than male homosexuality - - and it's true in my experience . I've always been curious about alternative life styles and spent a good deal of time in and around gay bars in Greenwich Village and San Francisco ( including the one and only original Black Cat Cafe on Montgomery ) , used the words "" campy "" and "" gay "" before they entered the mainstream lexicon . And as a cultural anthropologist I went through the workshop on Human Sexuality Training at UC Berkeley . I don't really care one way or another about a friend's gender orientation . Yet I still wince a bit when I see men kissing on screen , while I find lesbian love scenes can be a turn on . The movie offers no explanation for this common experience - - nor can it , since no one has figured it out as far as I know . ( I'll skip some technical guesses here . ) Oh , a note . I haven't read the book this film is based on , but anybody who wants to explore the dynamics of a gay community should check out Frances Fitzgerald's "" Cities on a Hill . "" The movie pulls a lot of information together and makes a convincing case for its chief argument , which is that gay people have been unfairly treated on the screen . In early movies they were mainly lisping and limp-wristed stereotypes , good mainly for laughs . Think of prissy Franklin Pangborn or Edward Everet Horton . I guess it must seem demeaning to gay people , but it really IS funny to see a person assume a different identity and use a bit of overkill . It's always amusing to see Robin Williams act gay ( or do his Yiddish schtick ) on TV . The humor in mixed identities goes back at least to Greek comedy . To explain why it's funny , you'd have to have a philosophy of jokes and humor , and a better one than Freud's . In a second filmic developmental stage , both male and female gays became villains . Again the movie offers no explanation for the change , although again maybe none is possible . And modern movies STILL turn many heavies into homosexuals - - even a liberal fave like "" Z "" , for instance . Or Gene Hackman's aide in "" No Way Out "" or Hitchcock's "" North by Northwest . "" I can't see any particular reason for this overlay of "" evil . "" It may be amusing to act out an identity different from the one with which you were biologically endowed , but it isn't naturally enraging to hand the same problem over to a villain . Not that there aren't evil gay people , just that there's no reason to think that there are more evil gay people than evil straight people , so why are they disproportionately represented on screen ? I think I can take a simple guess at this answer . A lot of middle Americans hate queers . I would guess that if you were going to come out , it would be a lot safer to do it in a blue state than in a red state . The narration keeps us up with the clips we're seeing on screen but carries an accusatory tone - - YOU did it , you Fascist . I don't especially like it because , frankly , I didn't do a thing and neither did anyone else I know . Actually I think homosexuality may be Mother Nature's way of damping population explosions . ( It increases among crowded mice . ) The most penetrating remarks , and the only funny ones , come from the talking heads who have been in one way or another affiliated with movies about gays . Some of these interviewees are really witty and direct . Susan Sarandon points out that lesbians embrace affectionately and sometimes kiss at the end of the film while male buddies run off bravely to die together , as in "" Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , "" in which "" they get their guns out because they can't get their ds out . "" There's a lot more to be said on the subject , and on this film , but let us observe the limitations on space . The movie ends on a somewhat upbeat note . Hollywood is now beginning to deal with homosexuality in a mature way . "" The Boys in the Band "" is given as an instance . But the movie was released in 1996 and doesn't bring up a newer trend that may be emerging . If gays were stereotypical jokes in early movies , and villains in later ones , they may now be turning into sidekicks on the screen or into supporting people who turn the movie into something "" hip . "" Vide : "" Copycat , "" "" Victor / Victoria , "" "" Internal Affairs , "" "" Single White Female , "" and a slew of others . It's probably their most encouraging cinematic function yet , showing us that homosexuality needn't be an earth-shattering mental disease at all .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
668,"Text1: After making big successful action blockbusters such as "" Con Air "" , "" Armageddon "" and "" The Rock "" , it was obvious that producer Jerry Bruckheimer tried to go for an Oscar with this little dramatic movie . A weak attempt . The movie could have been good but it doesn't get any better as average . Who's to blame ? Probably the director Joel Schumacher , he delivers a shallow drama without any emotions . Or maybe it's because of the main character . The character of Veronica Guerin never really becomes interesting or completely understandable with as a result that the viewer doesn't really get emotionally involved . Director Schumacher tries to make Veronica's character a warm loving mother and wife but fails completely in this and all the families scene's feel more like an obligation . Another crucial mistake is that in all the advertisements and also in the beginning of the movie it was told that Veronica Guerin was murdered . Now I'm sure that this is common knowledge in Ireland but I can assure you that it isn't in the rest of Europe and especially not outside of it . In a way it already ruined the movie for me . I know that this movie isn't made for entertainment but to tell Veronica's story instead but surely they could have made it more interesting for the viewer to watch by not telling how it would end . I know that Cate Blanchett was much praised for her role but quite frankly I didn't liked her all that much . But Maybe the reason for that had more to do with Veronica's character and not so much with Cate Blanchett's acting skills . But all in all this movie is not a punishment to watch but like I said before it simply doesn't get any better as average .

Text2: Although I certainly don't consider this movie to be Laurel & Hardy's best , it still is of course a very amusing short , that features plenty of good slapstick moments . The movie is a bit dragging at times with its gags but overall the movie has plenty of moments in that will surely make you laugh . Especially the ending is purely classic . The slapstick comedy is very typically Laurel & Hardy like , so fans of the two will surely enjoy watching this comedy short . Like often was the case with Laurel & Hardy , the movie can be divided into two parts . The first halve is about the comedy duo playing in a municipal band , while the second halve is about the two coping with the fact that they are fired from the band by trying to earn some money on the street by playing . Both parts have their up - and downsides but overall the upsides overcome its lesser parts . The movie got directed by Edgar Kennedy , who also directed the other Laurel & Hardy silent short "" From Soup To Nuts "" .

The first two-and-a-half minutes of this cartoon is live action showing a little kid feeding ducks , then following one of the ducks who strayed to a nearby a pond . At that point , an animated frog appears , starts singing to the kid and then relays a story to him . The story is far more dramatic than it is humorous , about the frog reaching from underneath the water , tickling the stomach of duck swimming by , and accidentally causing the duck to almost drown . The frog then has to turn into Johnny Weissmuller and swim frantically to save the duck's life . Then he's a hero to everyone in that duck's family .

Text2: This is simply a nice , dramatic story of a music teacher's life . Richard Dreyfuss plays the teacher , "" Glenn Holland . "" It spans 30 years of his career with a tear-jerking ending . Endearing characters make it a memorable film . The focus of the story is Dreyfuss and three students he gives special time to over the years . A big subplot involves the teacher and his hearing-impaired son . The students are winningly played by Alicia Witt , who plays the sweet girl who goes on to become governor ; Terrence Howard , a really nice kid who gets killed in Viet Nam , and Jean Louisa Kelly , the last and most memorable student perhaps , an extremely talented singer who goes on to a career in New York City . Interwoven are some personal stories , particularly with Kelly's character , and with fellow teachers ( Jay Thomas playing the most likable ) and school administrators ( Olympia Dukakis and William H . Macy ) . The most personal , of course , involves his hot-cold-hot relationship with his disabled son ( played by three different actors as time passes . ) Glenne Headly , meanwhile , plays Dreyfuss ' wife . As you can see by this cast , this is a well-acted movie with the only flaw being the screenwriters unable , as Hollywood seems to be , to control their political bias by giving unwarranted cheap shots to Republican politicians who are pictured as being against the arts ; atheist John Lennon almost deified in this film as one of the "" heroes "" of the 20th century , plus a few more digs and plugs here and there , all with the normal Liberal bias .

674,"Text1: Shanty Tramp is often mentioned as one of the precursors to the exploitation tradition - and that would certainly seem to be true . While films like Psycho and Peeping Tom had already brought violence to the forefront , this film revels in pure SLEAZE - as while still comparatively tame compared to some later efforts , Shanty Tramp still contains a number of detestable characters including a drunken father , a sinful preacher and , of course , the central character - an insatiable young hussy who uses people for her own enjoyment . The plot focuses on said character as she sets out looking for adventure at other people's expense . She meets a man at a bar , but he ends up getting in a scrap with a black man and is shocked to find that she prefers him ! After rounding up his mates , the men prepare for vengeance upon the black man ; as does the girl's drunken father , who believes his daughter's lies that he raped her and gets ' every white man in town ' looking for him . All this goes on while a shady preacher is busy shouting about the lord ! The film was obviously shot on a very limited budget as the whole thing looks very cheap . Shanty Tramp was shot in black and white , but it's not the fluid black and white picture that adorns many , bigger budgeted , films as this one looks like the filmmakers got a load of film stock on the cheap . The acting too is mostly terrible , and the dialogue is mostly trite ; but all this is unlikely to put off the seasoned exploitation fan , who will no doubt be used to poor production values and non-talented performers . None of this stuff matters anyway , as the real focus of the film is on the shady characters and nasty situations that they find themselves in . The film doesn't feature much blood - and indeed , there is only one real shocking sequence in the entire film , but this is down to the time in which the film was made , and Shanty Tramp is still an excellent early taster of things to come . Overall , this might not be a great film in the classic sense - but I'm sure it had some influence on films that are classics , and it's well worth tracking down both for that reason and for the fact that it's a great deal of fun to watch !

Text2: There were heist movies before this one , and indeed the likes of Rififi were an obvious influence on it - but The Red Circle is more than just another entry in an overpopulated genre and with this film , director Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to create something that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience something to think about . Being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters , and Melville delivers that with this film in droves ; the tone of the film is very relaxed too and Melville allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior . The story has a number of angles but the central character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison . His release coincides with the escape of infamous murderer Vogel , who slips from under the nose of Police Commissioner Mattei during a train ride . The first thing Corey does upon release is steal some money from his former boss Rico , and the second thing he does is recruit Vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist . But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves ' tails . . . The film is bolted together by four excellent central performances . Alain Delon is calm and calculating as the film's anti-hero , while Gian Maria Volontè looks formidable in his role as the escaped murderer . François Périer is good also as a dubious club owner , while the real standout performance comes from André Bourvil in his role as the police commissioner . The film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride . However , the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements . The film does feature crime film stapes such as shootings , but they are kept to a minimum . The first two thirds of the movie are really just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end . Rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which nobody speaks a word . The heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless , and I have to say that I preferred the scene in Rififi ; but Melville's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it . The film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely . Overall , this might not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow ; but The Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Although her appearance in two late French silent movies made Miss Brooks an interesting star and her memoirs of the Hollywood scene made her important , in truth she rarely gave strong , animated performances .

Text2: One can see the influence of Sergio Leone writ large all over this large-scale Spaghetti Western ( and not just in the casting of Eli Wallach from THE GOOD , THE BAD AND THE UGLY [ 1966 ] ) – but Colizzi doesn’t in any way show a comparable talent ! The director also receives sole writing credit , which rather explains the film’s relentless self-indulgence – padding a wafer-thin plot with lame attempts at characterization and dreary passages of local color ! The film happens to be the second teaming of popular Italian brawling duo Terence Hill and Bud Spencer ( the first – GOD FORGIVES . . . I DON’T [ 1967 ] – was actually a prequel to this ! ) but Hill’s atypical glum countenance robs the film of some much-needed charisma . Incidentally , neither title – American ( which places an emphasis on the gambling subplot which comes into play only during the last third ) or original , which roughly translates to FOUR GUNMEN OF AVE MARIA – is really satisfactory . . . but , then , neither is the film itself : one isn’t bothered by the sluggish pacing and extreme length of Leone’s Spaghetti Westerns , but that certainly can’t be said here ! Mind you , being a vintage outing , it’s moderately watchable and , at least , the print ( via the Paramount DVD – how they suddenly felt the urge to release this I’ll never know ! ) was very nice . . . in contrast to its follow-up , BOOT HILL ( 1969 ) , which I recently viewed by way of a horridly panned-and-scanned Public Domain edition . Anyway , the plot involves "" lice-infected jailbird "" Wallach being sprung from jail by a corrupt banker to retrieve a sum of money ‘stolen’ from him by Hill and Spencer ; there follows an endless series of chases and double-crosses – with occasional interjections from black tightrope-walker Brock Peters and , it goes without saying , numerous stops for the duo’s trademark brawling antics . Eventually , the four join forces to clean up the gambling-house owned by Wallach’s long-time enemy ( and former partner ) Kevin McCarthy : this is an elaborate and mildly suspenseful sequence – climaxed by a shoot-out between the gang and McCarthy and his ( anonymous-looking ) henchmen on either side of the gambling table during a particularly busy night . The soundtrack is , once again , the handiwork of Carlo Rustichelli – but , while serving its purpose , isn’t especially remarkable within the impressive pantheon of Spaghetti Western scores . . .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Again as with most Milligan films , little more than a home movie ( stuff I shot looked like this and I couldn't release it ) this is the sort of thing only masochists and bad movie lovers dare watch . Certainly better than Seeds of Sin , the color and the period nature some how defuses the desire to put this on the unredeemable list . Come on how can one not enjoy-as with most Milligan period films - the desire to see the errors in continuity with objects from different eras mingling as if there was nothing wrong . There's a drinking game ( and alcohol helps these films ) in spot the error .

Text2: Dream like ( thanks to the extensive CGI exteriors ) modern film noir story starring Steve Zahn , Leelee Sobieski and Danny Glover . Set on a train traveling one night , it comes to pass that a sick man gets on the train . He dies before buying a ticket .

No the plot isn't perfect , there are too many twists and turns that just seem to be there just to keep things going and I wonder about one characters ability to get up after taking a certain amount of injury ( perhaps they were related to Michael Myers .

Despite being almost "" worship idol "" status by women , he is still comes across as a "" man's man , "" and that all started with this film . What I liked best about this was that the story stood out more than the action or the romance . Many times classic films overdid the latter , producing lulls in what was considered an adventure story . That's not the case here . It also isn't the typical clichéd pirate film in which the captain is seen with an eye patch and a parrot on his shoulder .

685,"Text1: As is obvious in the complex responses to both the book and the film by Errol Morris and Philip Gourevitch , STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE places in our faces some facts we would rather shield than discuss . The story of the period of between September 2003 and February 2004 at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq is so well known not only from the news media but also from the Internet blogging sites that it need not be outlined in a review of this film . The facts documented by photographs taken by those who participated and observed the inhuman treatment of prisoners are indisputable : seeing them on the screen in full frame and in close-up shots is almost more than the compassionate eye can tolerate . But there it is and yes , we do need to witness the abuse and humiliation that describes the US prisoner treatment in Iraq , no matter who is to blame - enlisted personnel , MI , high ranking military officials , the White House . The fact that it occurred as such a gross abuse of human rights should awaken in all of us a more complete awareness that war makes humans do such things . It is ugly to watch , difficult to digest , and extremely trying on our set of beliefs that man's inhumanity to man has and does exist despite our need to believe otherwise . Given the atrocities documented by this film , the style of the film as a work of cinema deserves to be addressed also . The flow of the documentary with the interplay of interview pieces by those infamous young people upon whose shoulders the blame was placed in what appears to be a diversionary technique to avoid deeper probing of the true guilt , along with the images of the prison itself - stark lines of cellblocks and living conditions so foul they seem to actually smell on the screen - is well conceived and beautifully / creatively captured by cinematographers Robert Chappell and Robert Richardson and enhanced by a strangely appropriate musical scoring by Danny Elfman . The film may be about things ugly , but the technique used to tell the story is high quality art . Abu Ghraib , along with Guantanamo , will always be a scar on the conscience of America , even beyond the time that this ugly Iraq war is over . We should all look at this film with the hope that with seeing actual footage of a nightmare may help prevent recurrences in the future . Grady Harp

Text2: Ora Carew was a blonde actress in silent films who was pretty but not especially talented ; she later had slightly more success as a screenwriter . ' Dollars and Sense ' is possibly her best film , as it gives her a chance to play two different roles . . . one of them male . The Keystone Film Company is remembered for slapstick comedies filled with pratfalls and pie fights , but some of their comedy films were subtler than this , with a gentler form of humour . Ora Carew and Joseph Belmont starred in a series of Keystone films ; she usually playing an innocent country girl , with Belmont as her shy hayseed lover . In the 1910s and 1920s , the Carew-Belmont films were far more popular in rural cinemas than Keystone's more typical slapstick output . . . which catered for a more cynical , urban audience . In ' Dollars and Sense ' , Ora Carew plays her usual innocent farmgirl , but this time she has a twin brother . . . also played by Ora Carew . Ms Carew's attempt to play a teenage boy is not especially successful . She wears bib overalls and clodhopper boots , and tucks her long hair down the back of a work shirt . Not for one moment is she plausible as a biological male in this movie , although she does make some effort to use different body language for her two different roles . But the ' male ' twin in this movie comes off more like a tomboy than an actual boy . For wildly implausible reasons , the plot of this movie decrees that the male twin is forced to impersonate his sister , in a borrowed frock and a horsehair wig . So , for most of the movie , actress Ora Carew plays a teenaged boy who is disguised as a girl . This sort of double-decker transvestism is very difficult to pull off , even for a first-rate actress , and Ms Carew simply isn't that good an actress . Her ' boy in disguise ' is clearly a young woman , not a boy attempting to impersonate a girl . Consequently , this movie is more complicated than it needs to be , and less funny . I give Ms Carew due credit for trying to stretch her acting skills in this movie , but ' Dollars and Sense ' proves that Ms Carew's talents were not especially notable in the first place .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
686,"Text1: I was called away and missed the last half or so of the film , except for the final few minutes , so I can't judge accurately how nearly the film fulfilled the promise of his first 40 minutes . But it was coming along very well indeed . Ron Livingston , who works with a computer in a cubicle , just like everyone else in his office , is dominated by the suavely domineering boss , Gary Cole . Boy , is Livingston sick of his job . He sees a hypnotherapist for some temporary relief . After inducing the trance and telling Livingston he will no longer worry about what happens , and before being able to tweak the post-hypnotic suggestions , the therapist drops dead and leaves Livingston in a permanent go-to-hell mood that even has him smiling benignly at the therapist's fallen body . Two investigators come to downsize the company and Livingston is in the land of Cockaigne . He is the only worker to tell them the flat-out truth . He doesn't give a damn about his work because the job is stupid and he's not motivated . The visiting execs take him for a brutally frank and perceptive subordinate . He's promoted . Livingston has the talent and , equally important , the right comic face for the role . He's a presentable-enough young man but his jaw is slightly large for the rest of his features and it lends him a dumb appearance . So far , so familiar . The guy who is somehow altered by circumstances so that he refuses to conform , is taken as a non-paradigmatic genius by others , and is subject to many comic situations . Just offhand , I'm thinking of a "" Twilight Zone "" episode with Jack Carson , Peter Sellers in "" Being There "" , a desperate Jim Carrey comedy . And , boy , there is hardly any more unpromising material to make a funny movie out of than a sterile office . "" Bartleby "" was able to do it . "" Office Space "" might have fallen flat on its face once it got past the first couple of funny scenes because , after all , unless there is talented writing behind the plot , a sense of progression , what you're left with is a single joke . I'd like to think this one did better than that , that it hit its mark . The morning after his transformation , a Saturday that Livingston has been ordered to spend at work , he shuts off the alarm , ignores his boss's phone calls , and sleeps until the afternoon while some vibes on the score give us a gentle and beautifully syncopated rendering of "" Beautiful Dreamer . "" The writers did more than just rob Livingston of his ability to pretend he cared . Jennifer Aniston has some comic moments with her boss too , and her uniform . She's a waitress in one of those "" cute "" chain restaurants like Chili's and she's required to wear a minimum of 35 buttons ( "" flair "" ) on her uniform . The buttons are incredibly vulgar - - pictures of Garfield and whatnot . Her boss earnestly talks to her about her flair . She protests that she's wearing the required number of buttons . Yes , but 35 is the MINIMUM number of flairs . Chester over there is wearing FIFTY-TWO flairs . So she'd better shape up . And Steven Root is sublime as Livingston's co-worker whose desk is always being moved ( four times in one day ) and whose Swingline stapler is always being snatched away by Gary Cole , leaving Root only a Boston stapler . I hope the film as a whole measured up to the part of it that I was able to catch . I'm looking forward to seeing Act II when I can .

Text2: This is a bad movie that purports to be an educational film designed to warn America about the menace of teenagers running amok thanks to uninvolved parents . However , like almost all the so-called "" educational "" films of the 30s and 40s , it was really a shabby little film designed to be snuck past the censors of the Hays Office . In 1934 , the major studios all agreed to abide by the dictates of a stronger Production Code - - eliminating sex , nudity , cursing and "" inappropriate "" plots in films ( these had actually been relatively common in films in the early 30s ) . However , in an effort to sneak in smut , small studios created films to shock adults when they learn about terrible social ills , though they were REALLY intended to titillate and slip adult themes past the censors ! Such films as MARIJUANA , MAD YOUTH , REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS were all schlocky trash that skirted past the boards because they were supposedly educational . Even though they were laughably bad , they also made money due to low production costs and because they often offered nudity , violence and sordid story lines - - all in the name of education ! Unlike many of these films , DELINQUENT DAUGHTERS didn't have nudity , but it sure had lots of sleazy story elements that were sure to titillate . In this film , teens drank , used drugs , committed pointless robberies and assaults and drove like maniacs - - all apparently the result of poor parental guidance . And as a result , kids died in this movie - - and in the most spectacular ways ! The acting and writing were almost universally bad , though the sequence where the judge tells off the parents of these punks actually was amazingly good - - too bad everything else was pretty lousy . In fact , one character was so bad , so annoying and so gosh-darn awful , I nominate the ditsy blonde as the most annoying character of the 1940s - - she was THAT bad ! !

Text2: SOME SPOILERS Taking place in the cold and hard winter of 1970 in the slums of Cleveland Ohio instead of the tranquil and pleasant 1967 Summer of Love in the Haight Asbuary district of San Francisco . "" Ghetto Freaks "" is a film that tries to show it's viewers the life and philosophy of a hippie commune and how it , lead by their Guru Sonny , goes through life on the mean streets of a large northern industrial city . Sonny who's having trouble keeping the women members of his hippie group from not trying to form any meaningful relationship with him is also being pressured by his former drug supplier Billy Moose to get back pushing his junk on the streets and to his fellow hippies . We see at the beginning of the movie Sonny and his friends doing their thing and then being run in by the Cleveland Police for unlawful assembly in a local park . Getting out within hours after their arrest the hippie's go back to their loft and start to get high on pot and do sex as well as plan their next move in their war against the establishment ; which is demonstrating against the war in Vietnam and the exploitation of the masses by those in power . There's nothing really new in the movie we get a number of songs and orgies along with the hippies dancing to them . There's this scene of a young hippie girl afraid of being pregnant , it turned out she wasn't , and high on drugs feeling that she's about to give birth to a new planet , or world , instead of a baby . Later in the movie at a hippie nightclub with Sonny & friends the police raid the place to find Diana , a teenage runaway , who's parents want to prevent from going into the hippie lifestyle and ending up a drug addict or even worse . Sonny spotting the young and pretty Diana , between tripping out and having sex with his hippie girlfriend Clara , takes a shine to her and slips Diana his name and address for future reference . The next day Diana shows up at Sonny's pad asking him to take her in as a fellow hippie which Sonny does without as much as a second thought . Giving Diana the lowdown on what's expected of her by him and his fellow hippies getting high on drugs and having unrestricted sex as well as panhandling to get money to pay the rent . Diana immediately get involved in a drug induced sex session with him that ends up with the entire group joining in . Out on the bitter cold streets of downtown Cleveland Sonny and his gang , including Diana , are later seen hassling and pestering pedestrians for money handing out what looks like super-marker flayers to people for whatever anyone , insane enough to buy them , would pay for them . This entire scene looks like it was filmed on the spot with the unsuspecting people on the street , not knowing that they'll end up in the movie . The hassled and pestered pedestrians for the most part let Sonny and his friends have it about getting a job a bath and out of their faces . Sonny who seemed to have become a hippie to get away from his previous life as a drug pusher has been given the word , by his fellow hippie Mousey , that his former boss Billy Moose want's to talk to him about getting back as one of his drug dealers . Billy Moose feeling that his hippie friends would be a study source of income in buying his junk . Sonny , now a reformed man , want's no part of Billy Moose or his drugs . Being a man that doesn't take no for an answer Billy Moose has his thugs work over Sonny leaving him unconscious with a possible fractured skull . The next day we see Sonny , and his fellow hippies , without a mark on him out in the park again demonstrating against the "" Evil Establishment "" and almost getting beat up or run in by the very angry upright and working-class people . The very people who Sonny & Co . are supposed to be demonstrating for . Things get a bit confusing when we then see Billy Moose with his head bashed in and face black and blue getting his boys together to knock off Sonny claiming that he was the one who beat him up . I got the impression that Billy Moose got his injuries from getting high and then falling on his head breaking it ! Since we never saw Sonny lay as much as a hand on Billy Moose in the entire movie ! Unless this assault on Moose was supposed to have happened off screen or ended up being edited out of the film ! Determined to do in Sonny Billy Moose spots him and his fellow hippies , including Diana , walking down the street one evening and opens fire on them hitting and killing Diana . The movie ends with Sonny and his hippie commune friends glumly standing in shock over Diana's body as the police and para medics arrive to take her away to the local morgue . The movie "" Ghetto Freaks "" tries to show the hippie lifestyle of the late 1960's and early 1970's USA and does a pretty decent job of it . Were not shown that being a hippie was so great like most films with bigger budgets and well know actors and actresses did back then . But were shown instead that it was a dog eat dog existence where every day living in it could be your last like it turned out to be for poor and naive Diana .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
688,"Text1: Guy Kibbee plays the titled detective in a meandering good natured romp that turns deadly . The plot of the film has an insurance company coming to call on Hanvey , a unique detective who has retired to the sticks . It seems a priceless jeweled necklace as gone missing and they want Hanvey to find it so they don't have to pay out the hundred grand . Hanvey finds out almost instantly that the jewels were taken as part of a bet and now they have to be put back with out anyone finding out . Unfortunately things turn deadly as the butler is killed and the wrong man is on the run with only Hanvey standing between him and the chair . Much of what happens is funny . Much of what happens seems to meander out of left field , but that's okay since its the loopiness of the proceedings that make this so watchable . This isn't the greatest film ever made but it is a good one that is far from run of the mill . I recommend this , especially if you've become tired of all of the other detective programmers of the 30's and 40's .

Text2: If you haven't seen this one , you've not only missed the movie itself but the irregular and irreverent allusions to it that crop up in other sources from time to time . You NEED to see this one , in the sense that you need to know that George Washington was our first president . The story of a naive girl ( Ruby Keeler in her debut ) who joins the chorus of a musical comedy being directed by a taskmaster ( Warner Baxter ) , and when the star falls down and breaks a leg , Keeler , with the support of other cast members , including the disabled star herself ( Bebe Daniels ) , is plucked from obscurity and sent out on stage to replace her . "" You're going out there a nobody , but you've got to come back a STAR ! "" Daniels tells her . If you're able to dismiss that line as a hoary cliché , it's because this is the movie that introduced it to audiences . And the script is loaded with such felicities . Anytime Annie ( Ginger Rogers ) only said "" no "" once , and that was when she didn't hear the question . And , "" It must have been tough on your mother , not having any children . "" It's the depths of the depression and the show MUST succeed . Everything is riding on it so everyone must work himself and herself to the point of exhaustion . Ruby Keeler , not used to clomping around repeatedly during the demanding dance numbers , collapses gracefully on the floor . Warner Baxter , the director , smokes constantly , scowls while listening , waves his hands , cries out for the rehearsal to stop , shouts in a quavering voice that you've got to give it MORE , you've got to give it everything you HAVE ! The poor guy has been though one nervous breakdown and is now , his doc tells him , headed for a heart attack . Ruby Keeler as the nice girl catapulted into stardom is unforgettable . She has the eyes of a Keane child - - absolutely huge , missing only the glistening tear trickling down one cheek . She's winsome and charming and can dance and sing about as well as you can . At her most inspired moments she seems to be stomping cockroaches with her tap shoes . She does however reach her apotheosis on the stage during the first night's performance . The staging involved goes beyond Baroque into the upper reaches of the Rococco . The dozens of dancers each carry placards which , when displayed side-by-side to the audience , present a vast panorama of gaudy , naughty , bawdy 42nd Street in New York . The scale of the display changes so insidiously that the visual experience becomes trippy . At one point we seem to be looking up at a huge skyscraper aiming at the stars , and then the life-sized juvenile lead ( Dick Powell ) and Keeler appear at the top , smiling at us and singing , and we realize the skyscraper is only a smallish cardboard simulacrum lying flat on its back . The camera is used in an overhead shot of dozens of women dancers who move their arms and legs in such a way as to resemble excessively willful flower petals . The accommodating camera also takes us on a theme park tour between the knees of the chorus girls with their legs spread in the second ballet position . There is a kind of "" Slaughter on Tenth Avenue "" vignette of a crime passionelle in which a guy has an argument with his girl , she jumps out the window onto a rooftop , he follows her to the street and stabs her to death , while Dick Powell in the window above shakes his head in amused resignation and takes another drink . The dramatic moments are among the funniest . It's easy to make fun of this movie - - mainly because it IS silly . And yet , despite that , the director , Loyd Bacon , draws us into the effort it takes to put a musical comedy together . And it's an ensemble effort , not limited to the tale of Ruby Keeler . We get repeated shots of the stage manager doing his thing , and Jerry , the rehearsal pianist , fast asleep with his head on the piano during breaks . In spite of its own throw-away quality the movie captures some of the suffering and anxiety , and the solidarity that the superordinate goal generates . Some of the cast sacrifice their own shots at stardom and give it to Ruby Keeler because she is most likely to turn the show into a success , thus proving that no chorus girl is an island . See it - - and see it now .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Rebecca De Mornay plays a young train employee who shares their hopeless situation ( she was asleep on the train when the heart attack happened ) and John P . Ryan is the associate warden of the prison who is deadly determined to bring Manny down - no matter what he has to do . One of the best action thrillers that I've ever seen ! This is a gripping and compelling and , yes , thrilling movie that never lets up . It has all these nail-biting scenes and a superb performance by Voight . It has good photography and a good script ( to that end , it is a refreshing change of pace from action movies that revel in their stupidity ) . You can't really go wrong with this movie - it even has a good villain , well performed by Ryan . Ranken ( Ryan ) and Manny really do make for good adversaries . It is a long movie but it did manage to hold my attention . Features a memorable scene where Ranken forces railroad employee Frank Barstow's ( Kyle T . Heffner ) head into a toilet bowl AFTER HE HAS JUST PEED IN IT . How humiliating is that ! The screenplay was co-written by real-life criminal-turned-author Edward Bunker ( based on a screenplay by legendary Japanese film-maker Akira Kurosawa ) , who appears in the movie as "" Jonah "" . Look for future film tough guys Danny Trejo ( whom I know best from his roles in Robert Rodriguez movies ) and Tommy "" Tiny "" Lister Jr . in their film debuts . ! !

Text2: After years of searching , musician Harry Washello ( Anthony Edwards ) thinks he's found his dream girl in waitress Julie Peters ( Mare Winningham ) . However , one night he arrives at her diner at four in the morning after missing a date , and decides to pick up a ringing pay phone and hears a frightened rant by a hysterical missile silo worker who says that nuclear war has begun . As time runs out , and the streets fill up with insane , panicky mobs , Harry races to find Julie and get the hell out of L . A . While this movie gets a little too silly at times ( at one point Harry just walks into the street just randomly searching for a helicopter pilot ) I found "" Miracle Mile "" to be a harrowing , chilling , and at the same time fairly poignant ( in terms of the love story ) tale . I thought that it was well made and involving and I genuinely liked some of those performances ( Edwards and Winningham make for an appealing couple ) . One sequence that is particularly distressing is when Wilson ( Mykel T . Williamson ) , a young man who Harry runs into , sprays some cops with gasoline in order to make a getaway . . . and the female cop actually FIRES HER GUN , setting herself on fire - and then her partner , when he jumps on her in a misguided attempt to save her . Now that's bleak . Then again , the whole film is bleak . Like I said in my summary , there are some flaws , but I was so entertained that I felt I couldn't miss a second of it . Definitely compelling . Kelly Minter gets prominent billing in the opening credits but she's actually barely in the film , leading me to think that if she shot any other scenes than the ones seen in the film then they must have been scrapped . Same goes for her "" role "" in "" The Lost Boys "" : she's listed in the opening credits but never shows up on screen ( at least , not that I noticed ) . Film has a nice role for B-movie veteran John Agar , as Julie's grandfather . Lots of familiar faces in the supporting cast , including Denise Crosby , Kurt Fuller , Robert DoQui , Brian Thompson , Jenette Goldstein , Earl Boen , Alan Rosenberg , etc .

691,"Text1: Grandpa ( Peter Falk ) comes to his grandson's ( Fred Savage's sickbed ) to entertain him - he's going to read the tale of the Princess Bride - a story with fencing , and giants , and all the excitement and adventure the grandson craves , with some love scenes as well . What Savage and the audience do not realize is that they are getting a bunch of the oddest figures in a fairy tale that one can imagine . On the surface THE PRINCESS BRIDE tells us the story of Westley ( Cary Elwes ) and Buttercup ( Robin Wright Penn ) . Westley a groom on Buttercup's estate who falls in love with ( and is in love with ) Buttercup . But he is lost at sea , and she reluctantly agrees to marrying Prince Humperdink ( Chris Sarandon ) . She is kidnapped by the a trio of brigands ( Wallace Shawn , Mandy Patinkin , and Andre the Giant ) who seem to intend to kill her . This can have serious repercussions on the relations of the two neighboring counties ( one of which is ruled by Prince Humperdink ) . But the kidnappers are pursued at sea by a mysterious pirate ship . They are pursued on land too - and confronted by a legendary pirate ( Elwes ) . He has a confrontation with each , concluding with Wallace Shawn , who outsmarts himself in a dizzy philosophical duel . So it goes in this crazy story , with it's wizards , giant rats , cruel rulers and their assistants ( Christopher Guest ) and duels and vengeance and true love conquering in the end . The chief villain is not physically destroyed ( not even the original SHREK avoided that cliché ) , but left universally ruined by humiliation . The second hero neatly avenges his father . The fact is the characters behave rather realistically in this story . Guest when confronted by a physical threat behaves realistically - he flees . The marriage ceremony is presided over by "" an impressive clergyman "" ( Peter Cook ) who gets so carried away by his own eloquence he fails to do an important act in the ceremony . A wizard and his quarreling wife ( Billy Crystal and Carol Kane ) give a charm to help the heroes , wave pleasantly as they leave , and then admit they couldn't care less about these people . I do not think any other attempt at a filmed fairy story was ever so satiric , except the above mentioned SHREK and it's sequels ( which came after THE PRINCESS BRIDE ) . THE WIZARD OF OZ was funny at points , but it was not a satire of the genre ( and the two wicked witches in the film were destroyed ) . Nothing by Disney was satiric . You can consider the cartoons on ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE ( FRACTURED FAIRY TALES ) as a precedent , but that was a television show - not a movie . Also they were told quickly ( within three or four minutes tops ) . But THE PRINCESS BRIDE made the fairy tale grow up . It did not forget the charm of the genre - the wonder of the dangers confronting Buttercup and Westley are there ( and quite real ) throughout the film . So is the warmth of the occasional scenes and comments between Falk telling the story and Savage hearing it . But they certainly knew how to make the story more accessible to adults by the spoofing . It is a very well done film and deserves a "" 10 "" .

692,"Text1: When you're in your twenties , you feel invincible . Fresh out of school , and with a world of opportunities ahead of you , the general feeling is that nothing can go wrong . At least that's how I felt . And so far , nothing drastic has knocked me off my feet , or grounded my perceived progress to a halt . That is , until you hit the big three-oh , and start wondering about a whole host of issues , like what you're going to do with your life , are you going to settle down with that someone special if he / she exists , and essentially , what the heck happened in the last 10 years which seem to just whizz by , as if the decade just passed by without any significant milestones . And the male characters in The Last Kiss , are about the same age as I am , and in this story , they take a long hard look and evaluate heir circumstances , albeit all from a relationship point of view . Adapted from a Spanish movie L'ultimo Bacio with a screenplay by Paul Haggis ( who also wrote the screenplays for Casino Royale and Flags of Our Fathers now out in theatres ) , The Last Kiss stars Zach Braff as Michael , our guy who's stuck at the crossroads of his life . Everything's fine and dandy , great job , hybrid car , and living in with his pregnant girlfriend Jenna ( Jacinda Barrett ) . However , that contemplation of life , of what's next , and his disbelief about marriage , has forced him to seriously think about the future . He's unsure , and in his vulnerable state , gets very tempted by a younger , beautiful girl , Kim ( Rachel Bilson ) when she throws herself at him . Yes , Rachel Bilson from TV's OC has followed in the footsteps of fellow OC hot babe Mischa Barton , playing yet another sweet nubile temptation in their big screen debut ( Barton did her tour in The Oh in Ohio ) . As the seductress , her character totally loses herself in the company of Michael , and feminists in the audience would roll their eyes and find it hard pressed to find a valid reason to fall for that cad Michael , who is definitely tempted and should have stuck to his guns . Although the spotlight is definitely centered on this story arc , there are a few others which focus on Michael's friends , all hitting their 30s , and each facing dilemmas in their own right . Chris ( Casey Affleck ) is not getting along with his wife , who's high strung from taking care of their kid , Izzy ( Michael Weston ) cannot get over his ex girlfriend , and is actually an obsessive wuss , upset at her ability to move on so easily , and Eric Christian Olsen as Kenny the hipster player who's totally non-committal . Interactions between the guys are limited though , and each potential short story arc brings forth potential unexplored in full . But perhaps we have to leave it to the older folk to shed some light in this movie . Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson somehow light up the screen with their chemistry , as two elderly married couple who are at odds with each other , because of the lack of some tender loving affection showered upon the other . Harold Ramis makes a surprise appearance , and he's almost ballooned to twice the size since his lean Ghostbusters days . I'd actually thought I could easily identify with the broad issues faced by the host of characters here , but given it's focus just on relationships , it was a little below expectations . Nonetheless , it's one movie whose themes do set you thinking , especially about the touchy issue on fidelity ( hence , who's the recipient of your very last kiss ? ) , and even then it doesn't end by making any bold statements , but it chose to sit on the fence .

Text2: I'm a sucker for romances of such nature , and I thought romances usually fall broadly under two categories - one bearing films like Midnight Sun , and the other being romantic comedies . It's a sweet love story between a busker with a great voice , and an unskilled surfer dude . It's a tale about a love with an end date put on it , and it makes you wonder if it's only with an end in sight , that you try and make the most our of everything , rather than to waste time and take things for granted . Japanese singer Yui plays Kaoru , a girl inflicted with a rare disorder , which makes her nocturnal . She cannot go out in the sun as the UV rays will wreck havoc on her skin and kill her , and so , from birth , has been kept indoors most of the time , and let out an night to allow her to do what she loves most - busking at a secluded corner at her neighbourhood . She has a crush on Koji ( Takashi Tsukamoto ) , a surfer dude , an average guy with an average life . Each night , she observes him , without his knowledge , from her bedroom window , until one day when she picks up enough courage to make the first move . Welcome to the world of Japanese romance movies once again , where beautiful cinematic shots are used to enhance locales and make them so integral in the story . Where love is saccharine sweet , and the leads oh-so-beautiful . The songs too , written and sung by Yuri , grows on you , and I won't be surprised if the soundtrack for the movie is selling like hot cakes . What I thought raised the movie to a different level , is how parents are involved . Usually , in most romances , the parents are out of the picture . Here , they are so very much part of the entire set up , and while they do take the backseat at times , there're scenes dedicated just for the parents , and especially the father figure . It's always especially painful to see your child suffer under an incurable disease , and as a parent , incapable of lifting a finger to help , because you just can't , definitely hurts . Here , the melodrama works full steam , but I thought it was a nice touch to be inclusive of those who always provide unconditional love - parent to child . Clocking at two hours , the initial pacing is a bit slow when establishing characters and premise , but once that's done , the movie's a breeze . It's an excellent date movie , so guys , take your lady love to this movie , and of course , Yui is opportunity for you to ogle ; - ) Remember to bring those tissues !","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: hmmm . here we have another example of classic , iconic movie , which is improved on by its sequel yes , the sequel is better , but that doesn't take away from the brilliance of this film . Alen is obviously a part of pop culture and well it should be . it revitalized the science fiction / horror genre , actually re-wrote the book . 1977's Star Wars of course redefined science fiction , but Alien was responsible for the re genesis of the horror / sci-fi combo . although released in 1979 , it still stands the test of time , and contains perhaps the most horrific scene in the genre to this day . the suspense factor is still very high to this day . the movie may seem a bit slow at times , but that is to build the suspense . this is not a "" b "" movie by any stretch of the imagination , though that might have been the intent at one point . the production values look very high even though the budget was tight . the film has a gritty , dirty feel to it . it looks very authentic . the reveal of the creature was well done . instead of giving too much away , you are shown bits at a time . when the creature is revealed it is something that hadn't been seen before , thanks to the genius of H .

After a couple of adventures they realize that Coo can't stay with the family , and after trip to find a place for him to stay , the media finds out and a circus ensues . Five year labor of love for the director is an uneven and much too long story of friendship , family , media and a few other things ( the film runs almost two and a half hours ) .

Scotland Yard is stumped and have assigned their best man to break the case . Meanwhile another fiend is on the loose , one who is neatly severing the heads of young women . The bodies are found the heads are not . Made in Germany as part of the Edgar / Bryan Wallace series that ran through out the 1960's this is an atmospheric popcorn movie . This neat little thriller is based on Bryan Edgar Wallace's book The White Carpet . I'm not sure how much of the story is there or how much has been changed but whats on the screen is a really diversion . Say what you will about a plot that has two halves that really don't belong together , the movie manages to keep them both interesting . The film is heavy on mood and atmosphere with the dark night time photography making what ever German city this was filmed in seem like London in the fog . The look of the court of the "" Executioner of London "" is suitably creepy especially with all of the men decked out in black hooded robes ( shots of the court in the trailer are what drew me to the film ) . The solution is probably not something you're going to work out completely , then again you really won't care since the film moves along at such a good clip it just carries you along . If there is any flaw in the film its that the two halves of the story never really seem to belong together .

I do not think the opening scene was necessary and it took away any surprise you might have received . Wong basically shows you that the movie is more than just another kung fu movie as he demonstrates magic . I think it would have been more effective to wait till the three storm guys showed up . I did not care for the ending . Kurt has a great last line , but then they have one more scene in his truck that is more like the ending of one of those bad horror movies . Other than that though this one is a really fast paced action movie . I love Kurt as the average guy sucked in a world of really high flying karate and magic . This movie has a lot of comedy as well . Kurt loses his truck , his friend loses his fiancé so they have to work together to get both back , plus the friend owes Kurt a substantial sum of money . They have to go through the lair of this really strange old man whose body guards include these guys known as the three storms . They are Rain , Lightening , and Thunder . Their opening scene is quite impressive as they appear to be pretty much invincible . All in all this movie is one heck of a wild ride .

The Joker has figured out a way to kill Soupey ( that darn Kryptonite ) and asks Lex Luthor for a billion dollars to pull it off . Thus , a plot involving Batman and Superman beating henchmen , escaping death traps and flying through the night sky follows . It is rather amusing and the scenes where Kent and Wayne see through each other's identities is cool . But there's no great plot to get involved in and it ends a bit abruptly .

Crusty ace driver Red ( the always exuberant Darren McGavin , carrying on with greater flair and verve than the sub-par material deserves ) and rascally fellow old-timer Indie ( the solid George Touliatos ) are two such guys , whooping it up as they constantly elude getting nabbed by a band of hard-nosed police officers who are very eager to nail their annoyingly evasive hides . While the premise - - basically a science fiction version of a Burt Reynolds-style good ol ' boy outrunning the pigs car chase romp - - has promise , it's fatally ruined by David M . Robertson's limp'n'lifeless ( non ) direction and a paltry , insufficiently thought-out bare-bones script . Moreover , the futuristic setting is depicted with a critical lack of conviction : there are no special effects to speak of , the cars look plain and antiquated , and the spartan costume designs are simply pathetic . Worse yet , the fuzzball baddies led by a sleepwalking Doug McClure are hopelessly colorless and nonthreatening ; only a murderously crazed Native American nutcase trooper ( outrageously overplayed by Alex Diakun ) radiates any necessary sense of genuine menace . The redneck protagonists are equally insipid and unprepossessing ; the picture's already slack pace screeches to a dead halt during the excruciatingly blah romantic courtship scenes between Red's wimpy estranged son Cameron ( the gratingly whiny Robert Charles Wisden ) and Indie's fiery foxy daughter Jill ( vivaciously essayed by cute brunette hottie Mary Beth Rubens ) . But the movie's grossest , most egregious and unforgivable blunders have got to be the copious , but poorly staged and thus unexciting car race sequences and a gruelingly tedious surplus of hideously banal dialogue ( sample line : "" Keep your pedal down and your sunny side up "" ) . So , despite some good acting and nice photography , this worthless rusty clunker overall sadly remains in teeth-gnashing neutral from the dreary start right on down to the spiritless finish .

699,"Text1: Harry Ward , a miner who gained notoriety for killing the men with him after a mine collapsed so that he could have further air , slaughters an entire hospital staff before returning to the scene of the crime , claiming the lives of partying teens , before being shot by then-sheriff , Burke ( Tom Atkins ) as he was about to murder Tom Hanniger ( Jensen Ackles ) . Ten years pass and Tom returns home days after his father's funeral ( . . the man who owned the mine ) on the verge of signing away the mine to outside contractors , in a sense selling the nearby town's livelihood in the process . Murders begin again , as a psychopath donning a miner's outfit and gas mask destroys victims with a pick-axe . Tom is an obvious suspect since the murders didn't start up until he returned from wherever he was at for a decade ( . . a great portion of this time is an important plot-point I won't reveal ) . A complicated love-triangle develops as Tom's former girlfriend , Sarah ( Jaime King ) , is now married to Axel ( Kerr Smith ) , the sheriff of the town . . Axel was in love with Sarah when she was dating Tom , and this unease that exists when all three are together after so long is of significance to the overall plot as this film continues . Formula slasher , extremely well made with all the Hollywood extravagances on display . I think the film lives and dies on it's 3 D gimmick and cashes in on the exhilaration of what such effects bring to an audience in search of entertainment . I don't , however , expect such a film to have legs once the gimmick is removed and those who left the theater experiencing weapons and body parts flying at them from the screen , will probably revisit it and realize that it isn't much more than that . I was certainly joyfully surprised to see such grisly violence on display , but the gore is mostly used during the 3 D process such as when an eyeball pops out of a head or a lower jaw is pulled apart . The film is essentially a series of chases between the psycho miner and victims fleeing for their lives . The costume and mask still delivers like in the original film and that pickaxe is used effectively . There are some hideous displays of carnage , the aftermath of the killer's attacks , with victims ' chests ripped open , and hearts in candy boxes . Startling sequence featuring Betsy Rue in full frontal nudity , reacting negatively to a trucker who taped them having sex in a cheap hotel . Many of the set pieces are expertly crafted such as the supermarket chase where the killer stalks Sarah and her check-out girl , Megan ( Megan Boone ; who is secretly having an affair with Axel ) throughout and a homage to the original film has miner outfits falling down as Sarah attempts to get away from the killer who follows her into a mine tunnel . I don't think many will be surprised at who the killer is ; you'd have to be pretty dense not to recognize it right away . The pickaxe is used as the primary weapon often in 3 D coming towards the screen . Great seeing vets , Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe ( . . as old miner , Ben Foley , a good friend of Tom's father ) showing up in the movie , providing the film with memorable exits . I couldn't take Kerr Smith serious as a town sheriff , he's just a bit too young and heading a criminal investigation of a serial killer , Axel seems just a bit too immature and volatile for an old-school mining town to tolerate as a man of authority . But , the excellent bit of casting in my mind was Jaime King as the "" final girl "" . . her scene alone , awestruck at seeing her old beau , Tom , again after a decade shows the richness of such a performance . I think King is the glue that holds this cast together , and provides a dramatic backbone that gives credence to so-so dialogue . Some bizarre moments exist such as the memorable murder of a dwarf hotel manager and the use of a mattress spring bed frame as protection .

Some lucky regions got them as late as 1975 , mostly of the colour Rigg and Thorson episodes , good news for anyone who had recently upgraded their television sets . In 1976 , ' The New Avengers ' appeared . Patrick Macnee returned as ' Steed ' , with Joanna Lumley as ' Purdey ' and Gareth Hunt as ' Mike Gambit ' . Many felt the concept of a trio damaged the show , leaving little room for the kind of romantic chemistry Macnee had earlier enjoyed with his co-stars . I personally feel that it was a necessary move , especially seeing how Macnee was in his fifties when the show was made . ' The Eagle's Nest ' opened the series .

As she and Stannard had been lovers , it is thought she might have knowledge of his present whereabouts . The trail eventually leads to the remote Scottish island of St . Dorca . Steed turns up posing as a tourist , while Purdey sneaks in unannounced . Back in London , Gambit chases the kidnapper of the noted German cryobiologist Von Claus . He catches up with him , but the man takes his own life . Oddly , he is wearing a hairpiece , the crown of his head is shaved , like a monk's . . . I will leave the synopsis here . Suffice it to say , the episode has little of the flavour of the original series , coming across more like a ' Freewheelers ' adventure . From the pre-credits scene you immediately know its not the ' 60's anymore . Laurie Johnson's music is very much of its time , Steed does not have his Bentley , and the elegance and charm that endeared ' The Avengers ' to millions is all but gone . As ' Steed ' , Macnee is as impeccable as ever , Joanna Lumley's ' Purdey ' was the best ' Avengers ' girl since ' Mrs . Peel ' , and ' Gambit ' , while his character was never developed as well as it should , gave a fresh look to the show . As ' Von Claus ' , Peter Cushing made his second ' Avengers ' appearance . He had earlier played ' Paul Beresford ' in ' Return Of The Cybernauts ' . Anticipating being criticised for stereotyping the German people as heel-clicking Nazis , Clemens deliberately made a good German the pivot of the story . The premise of Hitler in suspended animation was hokey even then , but it is executed with some panache here . Not showing us Hitler's actual face was a wise move . The main villainy is provided by Derek Farr as ' Father Trasker ' . I . T . V . ' s trailer relied heavily on clips from this episode , such as Purdey's fight , Gambit's car chase , and Steed saying ' Rule Britannia ! ' when discovered by the Nazi monks . It had the unintended side-effect of making this look like a repeat even on the first run . Critics were divided . Brian Lawrence of ' The News Of The World ' called it ' great entertainment ' while Peter Phillips of ' The Sun ' thought it ' did not deserve a slot even on children's television ' . Phillips ' harsh view was echoed by many ' Sun ' readers . They felt that the show was a lot of ' childish comedy , with stereotypical situations ' . What had happened was that other more realistic thriller shows such as ' The Sweeney ' and ' Starsky & Hutch ' had come along , and Steed and co . looked ridiculous by comparison . Nevertheless , ' The Eagle's Nest ' reached number eight in the Top Ten most watched programmes of the week ( not bad for a non-networked show ) , and eventually the public grew to like ' The New Avengers ' . Steed was back , and with a vengeance !","{""output"": ""NO""}"

When the woman whom he admires marries another man , Elias decides to commit suicide by never sleeping . Whoa . I know that European - and especially German - movies want to be serious ( unlike Hollywood movies ) , do they have to be so exaggerated ? Here , it seems that every scene has to be spirituality overload . Don't get me wrong ; it's still a good movie . We get a feeling of what a hard life it was in those remote villages back then , particularly since everyone in this one is inbred . It's just that they go a little overboard in trying to stress everything . Why must everything be a tragedy ? So check it out if possible , but this probably won't become your favorite movie .

Focusing on a womanizer ( Peter O'Toole ) trying to get help from an even more lecherous psychiatrist ( Peter Sellers ) , they just go all out and pull every trick that they can . Obviously , one of the really eye-opening things is the presence of Woody Allen in his debut ; and he's as neurotic as he is in his other movies . Ah , and then there's the chase at the end ( it seems like every 1960s comedy had a chase of some sort ) . You won't want it to end , even though it soon does .

The higher production values and the rapid changes of international locations give it an almost Bondian feel .

The action sequences - from the ( literally ) death-defying stunts to the dizzyingly fast fight scenes - are incredible . The plot is much stronger than usual for a Chan film , though sometimes it collapses into chaos ( particularly in the massacre after the meeting of the drug lords , where it's hard to know who's killing whom , or why ) . Michelle Yeoh cannot quite match Jackie in the comedy department - she doesn't have his facial expressions or comic timing - but she more than matches him in the action scenes , and she shows off some fantastic moves .

702,"Text1: Why the Nazis chose to spend a lot of money to make a film about the Titanic during the middle of WWII I'll never know . You can see that the real story of the ship is twisted into a propaganda piece that both extols German decency and decries the evils of a Capitalist society . It does this by creating some Germans and making them all nice folks - - particularly the First Officer that tries very hard to do what is right even though Captain Smith and the nefarious forces of Capitalistic greed are risking the lives of everyone aboard ! In the National Socialist Germany , the importance of individual profit and gain was publicly forbidden and America and Britain were seen as dominated by selfish self-interest . So the "" nice Germans "" are always mindful of the ultimate good and the rich Americans are the worse stereotypes of Capitalism . And so time and again , the First Officer is good and dutiful and tries his best to protect the ship and passengers while industrialists / speculators Ismay and Astor do everything purely for self-interest . All this was meant to convince Germans of the rightness of their political system , though the ugly truth was that many rich German industrialists became immensely wealthy thanks to German re-armament . Despite the obvious propaganda in the film , the movie itself was surprisingly well-made . While the shot of the Titanic ( using a model ) was incredibly sloppily done ( with VERY fuzzy camera-work to try to hide that it was a model ) , the rest of the film looks pretty opulent and the acting was very convincing considering it was made in 1943 - - as things were turning VERY bad for the Germans . Sadly , although the film is watchable and VERY interesting , it was not shown in Germany and was only recently discovered - - it deserved a wider audience despite its shortcomings .

704,"Text1: While It Conquered the World can't compare with some of the best sci-fi from the 50s , it's still a fun movie if you can get past the special effects . The plot is straight out of the 1950s Guide to Sci-Fi / Monster Movies . An alien comes to earth with the intention of taking over the place . The alien uses some sort of bat looking things to help him gather "" volunteers "" to his cause ( they hit them in the back of the neck and inject them with some mind-control device ) . The biggest difference between the plot of It Conquered the World and other similar movies is that one character , Dr . Tom Anderson ( Lee Van Cleef ) , is in communication with the alien and willingly tries to help him . This brings the whole Red Scare subtext found in a lot of these movies to the front as Dr . Anderson's friend and colleague Dr . Paul Nelson ( Peter Graves ) calls him a traitor . Being called a traitor ( i . e . a commie ) was about as bad as you could get in the 50s . One thing that elevates It Conquered the World is the cast . You don't expect ( at least I don't expect ) to see names like Peter Graves , Lee Van Cleef , Beverly Garland , and Dick Miller in the same low budget Roger Corman film . I can't think of many movies shot on this kind of budget with four names I'm so familiar with . Corman really had a knack for spotting young talent . The less said about the special effect the better . The monster is not as bad or poorly thought out as something like Ro-Man from Robot Monster , but it comes close to being just as silly . It Conquered the World might have benefited from not showing the monster . I recently watched The Space Children and noted that Jack Arnold was wise to limit his monster's screen time . What I wrote for that film applies here too ? "" Too often , low-budget sci-fi films from this period look ridiculous because of the desire for elaborate special effects ( i . e . monster and aliens ) that outstripped the funding it would require . "" In the end , while you can certainly find better sci-fi from the 1950s than It Conquered the World , you can just as easily find much worse . This one is about average but worth at least one look if you're into this kind of thing . You might want to check it out just to hear Peter Graves closing speech ? "" Man is a feeling creature , and because of it the greatest in the universe . He learned too late for himself that men have to find their own way , to make their own mistakes .

The locals do what they can to protect Pepe and keep the police off his trail in hopes of winning his favor . But how long can Pepe remain hidden in the maze-like Casbah ? The French police have a plan to use one of his best friends to lure Pepe out of the Casbah and place him under arrest . Complicating matters is a Parisian woman visiting Algiers that Pepe finds himself smitten with . She's different from what he's come to know in Algeria . She makes him dream and long for days of freedom outside the Casbah walls . To begin with , to anyone who recommended Pepe le Moko ? a big fat thanks . It's a great movie that I probably would have never even heard of had it not been for some of the good people at IMDb . As a budding fan of film noir , I was hooked from the minute the movie began . The plot kept my interest throughout . Never did it seem slow . I've only seen Jean Gabin in one other movie ( Touchez pas au grisbi ) , but I'm quickly discovering what a talented actor he was . His Pepe is a very believable character . He plays Pepe with style , feeling , and , when called for , viciousness . Director Julien Duvivier uses the twisted roads and alleyways of the Casbah to create a one of kind setting for his film . I've actually been in a place like this during a visit to Tangiers , and the Casbah in Pepe le Moko gave me that same feeling of a place you would easily get lost in . In many ways , Pepe le Moko is ahead of its time . First , I honestly had no idea that something so seemingly American as film noir could be traced to 1930s French cinema . Many of the American films of the next two decades can surely be traced to Pepe le Moko . Second , much of the subject matter in the film is certainly something an American movie of the 30s would never touch or discuss so openly . Themes of sex and adultery wouldn't be commonplace in American cinema for years to come . And finally , some of the film techniques used by Duvivier give the film the look of something made years later . The camera has a fluidity and style I don't associate with the 30s when so much of what was being made still relied on the old "" plant and shoot "" technique of the silent era .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Even with the goof of the highly visible boom mike , them pretending that one of the girls with smallish tits is generously well-endowed , and none of the girls being particularly attractive , this film is still strangely watchable and has an aura of good feeling around it .

Text2: So I'm no expert on World War II , but the idea of some German prison officers being even remotely interested in a game of soccer between themselves and their prisoners seems pretty ludicrous to me . Nonetheless , this movie does a good job of justifying that idea , presenting it as a huge propaganda event , something that would not have been too much of a stretch coming from Nazi Germany . The similarities to Steve McQueen's Great Escape are extensive , of course , but mostly in theme . i . e . the prisoners are duty-bound to constantly attempt to escape , and there are not a lot of different plot options that can come out of that duty other than a lot of officers planning tunnels and a lot of Germans trying to figure out what escape plans are being hatched under their noses . In the movie's defense , even though the pairing of soccer with WWII prison camps is an uncomfortable match , the movie certainly does create tension and the ending is very , very good , I must say . When Stallone is first asked to return to the prison camp after having escaped , it was almost a mirror image of what Steve McQueen did for his fellow inmates in the 1963 version , but what unfolds in the rest of the movie is fairly original . The half time "" escape "" scene was very good as well . Having already returned once , Robert Hatch ( Stallone ) is faced with a choice that is much , much deeper than is commonly found in movies as low grade as many people are sure to judge this one . The closing scene is by far my favorite . You may have seen it coming a mile away , but I have to admit that it didn't even occur to me and , while I was kicking myself for not having seen it coming sooner , it's one of those things where it seems perfectly natural that the events were leading there all along . And having an ending that seems perfectly natural and yet is not completely predictable is one of the more difficult balancing acts that need to be pulled off in screen-writing . For my part , I was impressed , it's just a matter of getting over that hump of accepting the basic premise . I was sure able to .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

However , there happens to be a baby in the back seat . Slue is furious and wants nothing to do with a child at first , until he realizes that he can torture this child to his hearts ' content and turn him into his attack dog . The interesting cast is just one draw of this terminally offbeat cult item . It also features Michael Griffin , as the young adult incarnation of Sonny Boy , who does a remarkable job in a difficult role . Alexandra Powers plays a potential romantic interest , Conrad Janis an alcoholic local doctor who supposedly conducts transplants using monkey parts , and Sydney Lassick ( it's cool that this movie re-unites two cast members of "" One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest "" , him and Dourif ) as a criminal accomplice . The rural locations ( this was filmed on location in New Mexico ) are well photographed and art direction / set decoration are also done well . It's set to some rather nice , flavorful music by Carlo Maria Cordio and moves along fairly well . Graeme Whiflers ' script is full of both humor and pathos . While this movie may inevitably be off-putting to some folk , it makes a strong condemnation of the horrors of child abuse in the context of a wild dark comedy / drama .

( There was a remake in between , ' Roxie Hart ' : starring Ginger Rogers . ) Apart from the obvious difference that one ' Chicago ' is silent and the other is a musical , both films tell exactly the same story . The major difference is that murderess Velma is a minor character in the silent version . Also , in the silent version , Roxie's husband is presented more sympathetically rather than as a fall guy . When I saw the 2002 ' Chicago ' , set in the Jazz Age 1920s , I was annoyed by a couple of musical numbers in which the dancers were wearing blatantly modern disco-era outfits , which would never have been tolerated in 1927 . Yet , ironically , the 2002 ' Chicago ' does a much better job than the 1927 original in evoking the 1920s period settings . The silent-film ' Chicago ' is conceived as a MODERN story , set in the jazz-baby present day , and so it makes little effort to evoke its own period . Much of this movie takes place in cramped studio sets which are supposed to be dingy walk-up flats or courtrooms , but which fail to convince . If you've seen the recent ' Chicago ' , then you already know the plot of this 1927 movie , including all the surprises and plot twists . During Roxie's trial for homicide , the prosecutor ( Warner Richmond ) has a larger and more sympathetic role than in the musical remake . Fans of Eugene Pallette will be impressed with him here , but disappointed by how little he has to do . Phyllis Haver is excellent in the lead role , and sexier than Rene Zellweger . ( Though not nearly as sexy as Catherine Zeta-Jones . ) This ' Chicago ' was produced in 1927 , the first year of the Academy Awards . I wonder what the people connected with this movie would have thought if someone had told them that this story would win the Oscar for Best Picture . . . but not until 75 years later . I'm a silent-film fan . When a silent film is remade as a talkie , I often enjoy the silent version much more than the remake . In this case , I don't . I'll rate the 2002 ' Chicago ' , very much deserving its Academy Award for Best Picture . I'll rate this 1927 ' Chicago ' only . I recommend it as a curiosity , but it inevitably suffers in comparison with the musical version . Quite apart from all those razzle-dazzle dance numbers , the 2002 version actually told the STORY better .

Text2:  Why Girls Say No  is one of Max Davidson's funnier comedies , even though the aggressively Jewish stereotypes are more obvious here than in most of his other films . Still , there are some very disturbing plot elements here . This is one of those movies which subscribes to the view that , if a man pursues a woman aggressively enough , she will eventually welcome his advances . In "" Why Girls Say No "" , Creighton Hale pursues Marjorie Daw in a manner which we would nowadays describe as stalking : when he starts out , she clearly has no interest in him at all , but he persists with high-pressure tactics ( such as lurking outside her upstairs bedroom window late at night ) and a couple of days later the two of them are engaged to be married ! Papa Whisselberg ( Davidson ) has an attractive young daughter Becky ( Daw ) who is beginning to attract gentlemen callers . . . but Papa insists that all of her suitors must be Jewish . When the doorbell announces the arrival of yet another young swain , Papa grows angry . . . until he gets a look at the visitor's huge nose , which satisfies Papa that the man is indeed "" kosher "" . ( The visitor is played by Jesse De Vorska , a gawky actor of extremely Semitic appearance . ) Becky attracts the attention of a young man ( Creighton Hale ) who doesn't appear to be Jewish at all . He pursues Becky very aggressively . She rejects him at first ( rather sensibly , I thought ) but is eventually won over . Only one problem : in order to call for Becky at her father's house , Creighton will have to pass for Jewish . Amazingly , he accomplishes this by wearing a hat several sizes too small . In the Whisselberg home , the men and boys wear hats at the table . . . which seems plausible , except that none of the men are wearing yarmulkes . Ginsberg ( De Vorska ) wears a jaunty straw boater . The funniest performer in this movie is Oliver Hardy ( not yet teamed with Laurel ) , playing a brawny cop who is very different from his famous "" Ollie "" character . ( Improbably , Officer Hardy is on patrol duty in the day time AND at night , but this movie doesn't stand up to analysis . ) In hindsight , Hardy's presence makes some of the gags very obvious . At one point , Hardy the cop tries to walk across a mud puddle : anyone who has ever seen a Laurel & Hardy movie will know what happens next . Elsewhere in the film , Hardy does an amazing pratfall . I also laughed at a gag sequence in which Creighton Hale , a fully-grown man , uses an amazingly simple ploy to disguise himself as a little girl . Give Stan Laurel credit for the script for this very funny film . I'll rate this movie . I really dislike the "" stalk a woman till she falls in love with you "" plotline here , but that mentality is so widespread in movies and tv shows that it would be unfair of me to single out this movie for disapproval .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
710,"Text1: I've haven't been much of a fan of the recent wave of popular Asian horror films , and haven't really paid much attention to the Hollywood remakes either . That is until Jennifer Connelly compelled me to take a dip into Dark Water . Connelly stars as Dahlia , who's in a custody battle with her estranged husband ( Dougray Scott ) for their daughter Cecilia ( Ariel Gade ) . Mother and daughter settle for a new run-down apartment , and experience strange leaks from the unit above . However , nobody occupies that unit , and soon Dahlia is drawn into the mysterious disappearance of its occupants . At times , this movie plays like the recent Robert DeNiro-Dakota Fanning movie Hide and Seek , with little subplots like imaginary friends , and the parent having some psychological problems . However , these subplots are never fully explored , leading to an ending which somehow leaves you with this empty feeling that more could and should have been touched on . Obviously , there are red-herrings thrown in , but there is absolutely no scary moment in which you'll jump right off your seat . This film though , is all about Mother's Love , and the longing for it . Many scenes in the movie make you go awww , drawing into your own experience of your mummy's concern for your welfare . The things that a mother would do to protect her child and keep her safe from harm , are always admirable . There are notable actors in this movie - John C Reilly , Tim Roth , Dougray Scott , Pete Postlethwaite , but they are relatively under-utilized , which is a pity . There is also a lack of a strong soundtrack to punctuate the right atmosphere in a horror movie . Since I haven't watched the original , I couldn't compare it for you . However , as a horror film , Dark Water didn't cut it , as it seemed more like a thriller / whodunnit / mystery with some mild supernatural elements thrown in . Perhaps it's just me , but perhaps Hollywood still doesn't have a knack in transplanting or capturing horrific elements from the original .

Text2: Thai writer-directors Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom have shot to prominence in the horror genre with their debut movie Shutter , which I had regrettably missed its theatrical run here , but more than made up for it by being the proud owner of the ( now autographed ) DVD . In my opinion , having mustered up enough courage to sit through horror movies now ( and find them really enjoyable , at times comedic though ) , I've shuddered at some of this genre's movies which keep on harping on the same thing , and got dumbed down by weak execution . Not Shutter , and definitely not Alone . If you think Banjong and Parkpoom are one hit wonders with their debut movie , then Alone will prove you wrong . Despite having counted on the usual lighting and shadow techniques , quick cut surprises and scares , and the pristine , well-crafted sound effects , it demonstrated that as long as you deliver the product with great technical skill and respect for the medium , it'll still be as enjoyable as watching it all for the very first time . Having a storyline which engages helps as well , and here the duo still seemed to have a thing or two for old photographs , this time showing the subject material of siamese twins , although not as grotesque as those shown in the Alone trailers . While the storyline isn't really that original , with the surviving siamese twin having to encounter the supernatural return of her deceased other , and if you look closely enough there are adequate hints of the revelatory twist to come , what mattered was how the subject again was being introduced and crafted , how tension and suspense were met out , and how easy it is to spook audiences when all the ingredients turn out right . Despite having some premise set up for the obvious , I was still taken aback at one of the scenes , and it is this constant sense of what's coming , and the expected delivery , which will easily make this a successful spook film for the mass audience . The duo had got the male heartthrob Ananda Everingham lead in their previous movie , and now the opportunity is given to the female gender - the beautiful and very photogenic Masha Wattanapanich , who plays the siamese twins Pim and Ploy . Starring opposite them in a Natthaweeranuch Thongmee kinda role , is Vittaya Wasukraipaisan as Wee , Pim's boyfriend . As Pim's mother ( Ratchanoo Bunchootwong ) is suddenly taken ill back in Thailand , the duo have to leave their careers in Korea , and journey back to the homeland , where the unexpected starts to happen . Pim's encounters with who she presumes is Ploy led to Wee thinking that she needs psychiatric help , but slowly , he too gets drawn into the web of supernatural intrigue . And in all earnestness , I'd say Masha had nailed her role to a fitting T . Given that Pim and Ploy's characters are key to the movie , she managed to bring out the vast differences in the character of the two sisters ( of course the teenage actresses who played the younger versions also helped loads ) . In shedding light onto the ongoing mystery , the expected blast from the past recollection and flashback helped provide a certain richness to the entire backstory for all the characters , and in doing so , played on a common theme , one that at times I like to ponder upon - which I cannot elaborate further other than saying , is ignorance sometimes bliss , and can you live a lie ? Alone is excellent stuff , even though the horrific moments might come few and far between , and there possibly was a sub-genre shift in the last 10 minutes or so . Nonetheless its numerous strengths easily outweigh the minute weaknesses , and in having delivered a superbly crafted tried-and-tested story , this could easily be a hit at the box office .

711,"Text1: As the ' 80's arrived , and alternative comedy got into full swing , a number of sitcoms appeared that were darker than the chirpy fare served up by the B . B . C . and I . T . V . in the ' 70's . Carla Lane gave us ' I Woke Up One Morning ' , a powerful , bleak show about men struggling to beat alcoholism , ' Affairs Of The Heart ' starred Derek Fowlds as a man learning to cope with life following a heart attack , ' Dead Ernest ' was a ( not very ) good attempt at black comedy from the writers of ' Brass ' , in which Andrew Sachs ' character died and went to Heaven but refused to accept the situation . Beating them all to the punch was ' Time Of My Life ' , broadcast in early 1980 , written by Jim Eldridge , and directed by Martin Shardlow , who also helmed the first series of ' Only Fools & Horses ' and ' The Black Adder ' . Mark Kingston plays ' Ken Archer ' , 49 years old , gainfully employed by the same company for 33 years , and happily married to 23 years to Joan ( Amanda Barrie ) . One day , he is summoned to the office of his boss . "" I don't quite know how to break this to you . You how hard it is to break bad news , such as you've only got two weeks to live , or you're pregnant , or you've been fired ? "" . The truth dawns on Ken . "" I've been fired ? "" . His boss smiles . "" Good man , I knew you'd spot it ! "" . Things get worse . He goes home and the first thing Joan says as he opens the front door is : "" Ken , I want a divorce ! "" . It turns out she has been conducting a secret affair with her son's best friend Stephen , 20 years younger than her husband and with a face that - according to Ken - resembles King Kong's ! "" So that explains those headaches you've been getting every night for the past few weeks ! "" , shouts Ken : "" Stephen's been getting you . All I've been getting is Patrick Moore and the Epilogue ! "" . These events are the prelude to a series of catastrophes to befall our luckless hero . Over the next five weeks , he is mugged , taken hostage , forced to earn a living as a street busker , see his cheques bounce , is arrested , declared insane and sent to an asylum . Even his attempt at suicide comes to nothing . Nothing goes right for the guy . All this was a bit strong for a prime-time B . B . C . - 1 slot . Perhaps it would have looked more at home on B . B . C . - 2 amongst the likes of ' Butterflies ' and ' Roger Doesn't Live Here Anymore ' ( written by John Fortune and starring Jonathan Pryce ) . It drew complaints from viewers who felt we were being invited to laugh at a man in serious trouble , but Jim Eldridge pointed out that its main theme was survival against the odds , one man staying intact despite his difficulties . Magnificent performance by Mark Kingston as ' Ken ' , almost Hancockian in fact ( the show was produced by the legendary Dennis Main Wilson ) . Like Anthony Aloysius St . John Hancock , Ken Archer becomes convinced the world hates him , and so he fights back using the one weapon he has - sarcastic wit . Eldridge gave him some cracking one-liners . For example , in the opening episode , Ken's secretary ( Avril Angers ) says : "" My husband is very fond of the tea the chimps drink ! "" and Ken replies : "" Judging from those pictures I've seen of him , I'm not surprised ! "" . In another , Ken is with an elderly couple who are watching ' Pebble Mill At One ' ( a long-gone B . B . C . - 1 daytime show ) featuring Kenny Ball & His Jazzmen . The old man ( Leslie Dwyer ) is slightly hard of hearing . "" Look its Kenny Balls ! "" . "" No , dear ! "" , replies his wife , "" Its Ball ! "" . "" Eh ? "" . "" Ball , dear . He's only got the one . "" . "" What ? "" . The wife raises her voice : "" I said he's only got the one ball ! "" . The old man looks shocked . "" Has he ? I didn't know that ? Poor man ! "" . Victor Spinetti popped up in one episode as an Italian waiter convinced that Ken fancied him . "" He peeench my bum ! "" . Perhaps it was right to end this after only one run . After all , how many tragedies can one man endure in a short space of time ? But it was a good laugh , and its status as a forgotten show is - in my view - wholly undeserved .

Text2: ' Shades Of Greene ' was an I . T . V . anthology series based on the works of Graham Greene . The episode which most sticks in my mind was the last of the first season - ' The Destructors ' - which was adapted by the recently deceased John Mortimer and directed by Michael Apted . Set in ' 50's Britain , it tells the story of Trevor ( Nicholas Drake ) , a young grammar school boy , who is both unloved by his parents and friendless . His main hobby is British military history . Trevor is keen to be ' a big fish in a small pond ' and so he becomes a member of a gang of ruffians ( among them a pre-'Quadrophenia ' Phil Daniels ) . He does not fit in with them initially . They laugh at his posh-sounding name , necessitating a change to the harder sounding ' Big T ' . Trevor comes up with a plan - namely to break into the home of an old age pensioner when he is away on holiday and trash the place . This they do . Cups are broken , books torn up , pictures smashed , even the old man's war medals are callously stamped on . Everything the man ever owned is destroyed . Throughout the carnage , Trevor is in full command , spurring his ' army ' on to ever greater acts of vandalism . When the old man returns , he is understandably horrified , but as there were no witnesses no-one is formally charged . Trevor returns to school . The gang follows him there and yell at him through the railings , demanding more leadership , but he completely ignores them . His moment of glory is over . There were protests galore when this was first screened . Many felt it was an incitement to youngsters to commit copy-cat crimes . It did not happen though as ' Shades Of Greene ' had little appeal for the young . I recall being shocked at the trashing of the old man's home - it had a savagery that I had never seen on television before . These boys were determined to destroy everything he valued , and did so . And no-one got caught or punished for it . The political subtext was plain for all to see . By wrecking the old man's house , Trevor and his gang were in effect conducting their own ' revolution ' against the establishment . However one wished to interpret it , ' The Destructors ' was a disturbing and memorable piece of television .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
712,"Text1: One reason horror movies aren't well regarded amongst critics is down to the fact that in order for the plot to work the characters have to do stupid things like wander around a dark woodland knowing fine well that people have disappeared in that location . In other words logic flies out the window . One other reason for the low regard of this genre is that plots have been done to death and the horror film has lost its lustre down to really rank repetition . SILENT WARNINGS is a case in point As soon as the characters are introduced I let out a very audible sigh . We're introduced to the staple diet of American horror movies - horny teenagers . This a diet that's been dished out to audiences for over 30 years and anyone who once had an appetite for this type of movie must now surely be suffering from a cinematic eating disorder . However at least the story does have some originality in that it doesn't rip off HALLOWEEN . Instead it rips off a couple of other horror / sci-fi classics . Can you guess what they are ? I'll give you a clue . One of them also featured crop circles in a cornfield and starred Mel Gibson while the other is a 1967 Hammer horror movie based on a 1957 BBC play by Nigel Kneale . Even the the title of conjures up images of the Gibson movie and I guess that's why this movie isn't called WARNING SIGNS I will be somewhat merciful in this review and take into account that this is a very cheap direct to DVD film shot in Bulgaria . At least the director has picked a location that resembles the American Mid West . Strange to think that both Stephen Baldwin and Billy Zane were once relatively well known prolific actors but I can't recall the last time either appeared in a fairly successful movie and I doubt if SILENT WARNINGS made any casting directors sit up and take notice . The rest of the cast are alright in rather clichéd roles and if you're in to horror or SF movies then you may find this movie a harmless enough time waster

Text2: This last gasp effort to resurrect Jon Hall's career has him as an American diplomat in India caught up in the usual web of intrigue and overwrought screen music .

713,"Text1: Many celebrities don't know their limitations . Once , Jean-Claude Van Damme just thought he could act . This film marks the first time he believed himself to be able to direct , too . Luckily , he didn't do so again for a decade . . . with some luck , he'll either be prohibited from further attempts at the ( admittedly tough ) art of directing after his next effort , or have learned a thing or two since he made this . I'm holding out more hope for the first , to be honest . I suppose , if one were so inclined ( personally , I have no interest in liquor ) , one could play a drinking game with watching this movie . . . but there certainly are other pieces of cinematic entertainment that are easier to sit through , and which would do the job for that just as well . The plot plods along , never really holding your interest ( or even getting it in the first place ) . The pacing is among the closest to non-existent in any film I've ever seen . The acting . . . well , the less said about it , the better . The children in the first few scenes give in better performances than the actual names on the film ( and believe me , that says a lot ) . The score is nothing worth mentioning . The writing is all rather poor . There is but one reason to watch this movie . . . and it's the fight scenes . Seriously , any martial arts fan should watch this for that one reason at least once in his life-time . So many styles of professional fighting represented . If the idea of watching a tournament right out of the Tekken games appeals to you , give the last third of this film a chance . About half an hour of this movie is non-stop fighting . Once it finally gets to it , it hardly ever stops to take a breather . For any other Tekken ( well , from the third game and onward ) fans out there , the fighting style of one of my personal favorites is featured . . . Eddy . Something that especially makes the fights exciting and entertaining is the unpredictability factor . . . while , admittedly , you kind of know who the ultimate winner will be , and who his main opponent will be ( this is Hollywood-ish action , after all . . . can't break formula ) , the majority of the fights , due to the fighters only being that ( none of them are really developed as characters ( not that that's all that different from the level of back-story and development of the actual characters , but still ) ) . They're possible opponents for our lead . Few of them are made out to be definite winners or losers . Think of it as the surprise level of the first Paul W . S . Anderson film you watch . . . only , you know , good . That is the one aspect of the film that makes it watchable . Well , that and it's good for a laugh ( but there are other , less painful films to watch that provide the same ) . I recommend this only to huge fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme and martial arts .

Text2: Along with Vincent , this short is featured on the DVD of The Nightmare Before Christmas . Since I first read about it here on IMDb , I've wanted to watch it . It's a delightful little film version of Frankenstein , seen from a child's perspective , and with charm and a sweet sense of humor . You'd be hard pressed to find a film that , whilst remaining somewhat dark , still manages to appeal to the kid in all of us so well . Most anyone can enjoy this . The fact that Burton was fired from Disney for making this kind of film is quite sad . This short displays beyond any doubt that Tim could easily have handled great children's films . The plot is well-written and moves along nicely . The scene of Sparky's demise is almost painful to watch , as it is so easy to see where it's going , how it'll end . But Burton holds us there , keeps us in a position where we can only watch , anticipating what will happen but do nothing . The way the story develops and ends works very well . I shouldn't write it out in detail , as it is far too great to spoil . The acting is solid , with few , if any , performances lacking . The characters are credible , if slightly grotesque at times ( a trait Burton brings to most of his projects , be they about the living or otherwise ) . The writing is very good all-round . The humor is neither cruel nor juvenile . . . just about everyone can laugh at it . It is at times somewhat dark , though . Not much left to say . . .

I recommend this to any fans of him and anyone looking to watch alternate re-tellings of the great novel .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
714,"Text1: It's as easy as 1 + 1 = 2 . This movie features a ridiculous concept and therefor the movie as a whole is a ridiculous one to watch . The title "" Danny the Dog "" should already say enough . Beats me why these fine actors ever agreed to appear in this movie . No , I seriously didn't hated watching this movie but I can't really understand either why so many people love this movie . Yes , well it is a different and original movie but its concept just doesn't ever make me take this movie seriously . The movie tries to blend material arts action with serious drama . It could had worked out and it does work out in several other , mainly Asian , movies but I didn't found the story of this movie to be gripping and believable and therefor it just didn't worked out for me . Two persons are taking Danny in their home and they don't seem to find it strange at all that he doesn't speak much and doesn't know and understand much of our world . Instead of finding out what happened to him and or where he comes from and don't notify the right authorities , like any other normal person in such a situation would do , they feed him and care him and take the time to learn him things about everything in the world and emotions and feelings . They adopt him like a son and brother , even though they know nothing about him . The movie begins fine and stylish but as soon as the drama and serious plot line of the movie kicks in the movie becomes quite dreadful to watch . After an hour it starts to take up pace again and the movie begins to get better to watch again when the action starts to kick in again . Louis Leterrier is obviously a capable action director as he also showed "" The Incredible Hulk "" . This movie was his directorial debut , after working as assistant director in several big productions before . I must say that he could had done a lot worse directing wise . It's not the movie its style or directing fault that the movie isn't really a great or effective one . It the typical new French action and enjoyable style of directing , which also can be seen in for instance movies from Luc Besson , who also produced and wrote this movie and no doubt helped out fellow Frenchman Louis Leterrier , with who he had worked before on several occasions . You could say that its the action that still makes this movie good and interesting . Everything else is just blah . Of course it are also the actors that still makes this a watchable movie . Not that Jet Li is a wonderful actor but Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman are of course always excellent in any movie . Jet Li is mostly there to provide the movie with its spectacular action and he shows why he should never been given too much lines . A mixed bag but the movie remains mostly watchable thanks to its action sequences from Jet Li and directing style from Louis Leterrier .

Text2: This third Harry Potter movie is different from the previous two movies . "" Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban "" is darker and much more mature but not better than its predecessors . Yet again there are several things wrong with this Harry Potter movie . The movie starts of too slow with a completely wrong pace due to some poor editing . Once the movie really gets started you'll notice that there are several things different about this movie compared to the first two . No , I'm not just talking about the visual style or the fact that Harry and his friends are wearing ' normal ' clothes , I'm mainly talking about the two things that I missed most in the movie ; The humor and the adult cast . What made the first two Harry Potter movies excellent to watch was the perfect English adult cast with many big names . In "" Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban "" the adult cast is heavily underused . Gary Oldman who I normally love was way too plain and boring in this movie , I actually really wish now that he hadn't been in it . Odd thing is that they let the main adult character play by the fairly unknown actor David Thewlis . Micheal Gambon does his best but he really wasn't Dumbledore to me . Richard Harris scene's as Dumbledore always brought a smile on my face and I really enjoyed every scene with him , Gambon just plays the role very plain and I just couldn't like it . . . Problem is that the story takes itself too serious . The first two Harry Potter movies had a fun feeling especially between the three main characters and some good humor . In "" Harry Potter the Prisoner of Azkaban "" everything is far more serious and less fun . The story also gave me the feeling that it wasn't very original all . It seems like J . K . Rowling uses a bit too many parts and elements from different fantasy genres . Good news is that the special effects are looking great . Another great thing was that there were some nicely done acting sequence's such as the werewolf scene which I found quite good . It is still good entertainment , especially for children and the Potter fans , although the movie probably is too scary for the very young ones .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Jean-Pierre Bacri is always going to be an asset to anybody's movie and not just those of his long-time partner Agnes Jaoui , which he also co-writes and here he delivers his best-known persona the miserable grouch which now fits him like a glove . I've never been much of a Benoit Magimal booster in fact the best I can normally give him is that he's the least objectionable of three current French heart throbs the other two being Vincent Cassell and Romain Duris but here he turns in a half decent and sympathetic performance whilst the usually reliable Vincent Lindon seems to be having an off day . Part of the problem is that the film has nothing new to say but insists on saying it anyway ; the plot is our old friend the intersecting lives in a small town where no one is having much fun least of all the audience . On the other hand Garcia really is incapable of making a completely bad film and there are just enough touches to make it tolerable if not memorable .

Text2: This is arguably Otto Preminger's finest hour albeit he inherited the project from Rouben Mamoulian . In my case the jury's still out on whether or not it was wise to jettison the several points of view that Vera Caspary employed in her novel but so long as we're stuck with a more or less straight-ahead narrative structure this example is as good as any with the necessary flashback element - to introduce us to Laura as she was in life - being placed up front where it will do the most good . With little to do other than look hauntingly enigmatic Gene Tierney scores heavily in the eponymous role and probably never equalled it again despite several notable At Bats . Dana Andrews has Mark McPherson down to a fare-thee-well and even well-know lesbian Judith Anderson almost convinces as Laura's love rival for Shelby Carpenter , Vincent Price . David Raksin's score , not least that stand-out theme has become undoubtedly as well-known as the film and those who know it only via the brilliant lyric supplied by Johnny Mercer after the film was in release and packing them in will be pleasantly surprised and maybe even a tad disconcerted by the pace at which it is first laid on us .

I was prepared to write a rather lengthy review detailing all of my many problems with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd , but after reading what others have already written on IMDb , I'm not sure I see much of a reason . The issues I have with the film have been spelled-out more eloquently than I could ever hope . Like many other Agatha Christie fans , I've always thought of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as one of her better efforts . It's a clever mystery told in an unusual style ( at least unusual for Christie ) . As other reviewers have noted , gone is much of the mystery that makes the book so wonderful . Instead , the movie adds on a quite tacky finale that's completely out of character with the source material . I understand that creative license must be taken to bring these novels to television , but this time it's just too much . I could , and probably should , have rated The Murder of Roger Ackroyd lower , but the acting , sets , locations , etc . are too enjoyable to rate it a total disaster .

Think Fast , Mr . Moto is the kind of movie that's best enjoyed curled up on the couch late at night when you want to put your brain on hold and just be entertained . It's like that favorite old , ratty shirt ? comfortable and always welcome . The plot in Think Fast , Mr . Moto may not make much sense ( even after everything has been explained ) but it's a lot fun . The film would hardly be as good without Peter Lorre in the title role . Unlike most everything I've see him in , Lorre gets the chance to be the hero here and is excellent in the role . The final cat and mouse game between Lorre and the always entertaining Sig Ruman is the highlight of the film ( although I must admit that it's difficult to watch Ruman and not want to laugh as images of the Marx Brothers pulling off his toupee went through my head ) .

Along with other golfing esoterica , the viewer should forever remember the game's Golden Rule : Always play the ball where it lies . The demonstration stick figure makes an interesting & funny character . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a storm of naysayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

Text2: A world-weary prima ballerina , desperate for love . A noble cat thief , desperate for money . A dying clerk , out on a last fling . His industrialist boss , passionate & brutal . A pretty young stenographer , willing to do almost anything to get ahead . A hotel bell captain , anxious to hear about his pregnant wife . And a cynical , war-scarred doctor . Destiny awaits them all in one of Europe's most renowned establishments - Berlin's GRAND HOTEL . This is considered to be the first ' all star ' movie . It was certainly MGM's most opulent film up to that time . The studio loaded it with an A List of star performers : Greta Garbo , uttering her trademark phrase , ' I want to be alone . ' Radiant in love , one can only imagine the despair that awaits her after the film ends . John Barrymore , suave , sophisticated & ultimately tragic . Lionel Barrymore , in a performance that will stay in your memory , slowly dying . Wallace Beery in a heavy role , all bullying bluff & bluster . Joan Crawford , tough as nails & good as gold . Lewis Stone , Jean Hersholt , Rafaela Ottiano & Ferdinand Gottschalk all lend sterling support . There was concern that putting so much talent into one film , instead of spreading the stars out over 4 or 5 films , would lose the studio money . Not to worry . It was a great success , financially & critically . Watch how the plot weaves the threads of the characters ' lives into a finished tapestry . One of the great movies . Tremendously satisfying .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
718,"Text1: The lead star and the concept of the film are what drew me to see it . Basically Jimmy Tong ( Jackie Chan ) gets the job of chauffeuring for millionaire Clark Devlin ( Jason Isaacs ) , who is actually a super spy with many gadgets . It is after Devlin has an accident , ending up in hospital , and unknowingly Jimmy tries on Devlin's tuxedo , discovering it gives extraordinary powers to anyone who wears it . It also thrusts Jimmy into the secret spy world with danger , international intrigue and espionage , and with agent Delilah ' Del ' Blaine ( I Know What You Did Last Summer's Jennifer Love Hewitt ) mistaking him for Devlin . There is a plot to kill everyone on Earth by giving them a specially developed water that will dehydrate all who drink it , and it is up to Jimmy and Del to stop it . Also starring Debi Mazar as Steena , Ritchie Coaster as Dietrich Banning , Peter Stormare as Dr . Simms , Mia Cottet as Cheryl and Romany Malco as Mitch . There are some highlights provided by the special effects for the suit , e . g . dancing and singing like James Brown ( who cameos ) , and a couple of not too bad fight scenes , but this isn't the funniest or most thrilling film ever , but you can't complain too much with Chan involved .

He sees that something has fallen on their chicken house and killed two chickens , and he brings the circular object home . On the next morning , Cleci reads on the news that a Sputnik is missing and might have fallen on Earth . Based on the picture of the satellite , they conclude that the object is the sputnik . Anastácio sneaks out of the house with the object and goes to the bank Caixa Econômica Federal to pledge the object and raise some money to repair the chicken house . However , the attendant Dorinha ( Neide Aparecida ) calls her boy-friend Nelson ( Cyl Farney ) that works in the newspaper Tribuna da Cidade under the pseudonym Jacinto Boucha , covering the social column , and he sees the chance of a scoop that could raise his career . However , the snoopy and unethical reporter Alberto ( Alberto Perez ) hears the conversation in an phone extension and releases the news on the front page . Anastácio becomes famous and has an immediate social ascension to the high society , moving to the fancy Copacabana Palace Hotel , while the Russian , North American and French governments send their agents to Brazil to get the sputnik at any cost . This is the fourth time that I have watched "" O Homem do Sputnik "" , one of the funniest comedies of Brazilian cinema ever . In 1959 , with the Cold War , sputnik and Brigitte Bardot , this movie is a hilarious collection of stereotypes . The sexy and witty Norma Bengell performing BeBe is na amazingly perfect parody of the French actress ; Hamilton Ferreira in the role of a Russian agent and the presently famous Jô Soares ( Joe Soares in 1959 ) performing an American agent chewing gums and swinging while walking are comical . The lines of Oscarito and Zezé Macedo are amusing , and Cyl Farney and Neide Aparecida play the usual good guy and his girl .

Busy , overlong romantic opus / travelogue based upon the life of Karen Blixen is really just an excuse to get these two beautiful stars together on-screen , and certainly their combined chemistry makes several scenes quite memorable . Streep flourishes in this extravagant role , and Klaus Maria Brandauer is excellent as her rather hapless husband , but director Sydney Pollack allows his pacing to plod , and wooden Redford never livens up .

721,"Text1: After reading several of the comments on this one my immediate reaction was they've got to be kidding ; to give them a break it appears that most of them hadn't seen the great Duvivier movie Pepe Le Moko which was released the previous year . We tend to think of Hollywood retreads of French Classics as something comparatively new but they were at it seventy years ago and they've yet to equal let alone eclipse even one French original . Adding insult to injury the credits nowhere mention that this in fact is virtually a scene-for-scene , shot-for-shot remake with the odd minor change here and there - like the ending . The only thing that Charles Boyer and Jean Gabin had in common was that both were French ; Gabin was , at times , a cross between Bogie and Cagney whilst Boyer is a cross between a second-rate baritone and Narcissus . Okay , it's well shot and some of the support is out of the right bottle but all of that applies to the original plus , of course , the definitive Pepe in Gabin . Like the man said , if it ain't broke . . .

Text2: Daniel Taradash was dab hand at fashioning screenplays from other media , be it a novel - From Here To Eternity - or a play - Bell Book And Candle . John Van Druten had been an established playwright since the early thirties when he had a huge success with Young Woodly . In the fifties he dramatised Christopher Isherwood's Goodbye To Berlin as I Am A Camera , this was subsequently filmed under the same title and later became the basis if Cabaret . In Bell Book And Candle Van Druten turned out a charming , sophisticated drama centering on witches and warlocks in Manhattan and Rex Harrison scored a personal triumph as the mortal lead who winds up with a witch . Columbia signed up a great cast for the movie version and for once non-actress Kim Novak landed a part she could handle , the witch who is not really at home among mortals . Also on hand were Jimmy Stewart , Jack Lemmon , Ernie Kovaks , Elsa Lanchester and Hermione Gingold . With a cast like that and more than a soupcon of charm it really couldn't miss and still stands up today .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
722,"Text1: Because of the prominence of the abolition movement in the 1830s - 1860s , other American social movements of the day are not thought of very much . If you are interested , read Tyler's book FREEDOM'S FERMENT , which discusses the international peace movement , woman's rights , and other movements of equal interest in that period - only these did not lead to Civil War . The woman's suffrage movement had begun in 1848 in upstate New York , but it really does not get the momentum that made it memorable until the 1870s . Then Susan B . Anthony goes on trial ( also in New York State ) for daring to try to vote in a national election . Also Victoria Woodhull throws her hat into the ring ( unofficially ) for the Presidency in 1872 . Later Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organize the woman's movement , so that after they both die in the early 1900s it grows until it achieves suffrage by Federal Constitutional Amendment in 1919 . THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM is not the only film to tackle early woman's suffrage . There is a bit about the movement in the character of Miss Massingale in THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL , who keeps confronting ( and romancing ) Burt Lancaster's army Colonel . But THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM is actually the only film from that looks at the movement at a critical moment in it's history . A little background is needed here . In the early days of the women's suffrage movement , there was considerable debate regarding allying the movement with other social movements of the day . However , Anthony and Stanton were convinced by Frederick Douglass to work for abolition , because if slavery was abolished ( Douglas argued ) woman's servitude would have to follow soon after . But in the post-Civil War years , the relationship between Douglass and the suffrage leadership soured . Douglass , once the 13th , 14th , and 15th Amendments got passed , was more concerned about African American ( read African-American males ) consolidating and expanding their gains . He started to curb joint efforts with Stanton and Anthony on woman's rights , claiming that it just was not the time ( although his previous argument had been to strike when the fire was hot ! ) . Anthony and Stanton eventually over-reacted . They never forgave the betrayal by Douglass , and soon they managed to make the woman's suffrage movement lily white ( and rather racist towards the former male slaves who now - theoretically - could vote ) . A small African-American woman's suffrage movement pushed forward too , but it was fighting antagonism by male African-Americans , and racism by white women who should have been their sisters in arms . The lesson though was now burned into the heads of the woman's movement - don't ally yourself with other causes . And , interestingly enough , this is the center for part of the plot of THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM . Betty Grable tries to keep her friends from allying themselves with another social movement which grew with woman's suffrage - Prohibition . She is unable to do so . In the decades from 1870 - 1920 many woman suffrage figures , like Carrie Nation , were also outspoken supporters of prohibition . These women ( like Nation ) had homes that had been wrecked by alcoholic husbands , so their stand and unity with Prohibitionists made sense . But the bulk of the woman's movement avoided this , because they did not want their political agenda tainted by a rival one . The same situation happened in the English suffrage movement too , when Mrs . Pankhurst's daughters split on allying with the British Labor Party , and the anti-war movement . Sylvia Pankhurst remained united with Labor leader and pacifist Keir Hardie , but her sister Cristobel was clever enough to offer to support the war effort in return for Asquith and Lloyd George's support for woman's voting rights . THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM has several things working for it . The two leads had a good story . Dick Haymes was actually better in this film as the hero who learns to respect working women , than he was as the son in STATE FAIR . Grable actually had a role in a musical that did not begin and end with her gorgeous legs , and moderately pleasing singing voice - it is her meatiest musical role . The Gershwin score is minor Gershwin , but still enjoyable . Like minor Marx Brothers or minor Van Gogh etchings , they are still better than most people's best . The supporting character actors cast , led by Gene Lockhart , Allan Joslyn , and Elizabeth Patterson manage to give a gentleness to the story , befitting the setting in Boston in the "" Gilded Age "" . It is a nice musical - not great , but enjoyable .

Text2: After seeing THE CATHEDRAL ( KATEDRA ) , I looked on IMDb for reviews of this Oscar-nominated short and the first one dramatically proclaimed it was "" robbed at the Oscars "" - - implying the winner should not have won . So , that encouraged me to see out the winner ( with the bizarre and less than exciting title "" THE CHUBBCHUBBS "" ) and I'm convinced that the AMPAS people ( the organization giving out the Oscars ) did NOT screw up by not giving the award to THE CATHEDRAL . While THE CATHEDRAL was amazing to watch from a visual perspective , it really looked much more like a cut scene from a video game than an actual short film . Whereas the CHUBBCHUBBS was very funny and a complete narrative - - with excellent animation , writing , voice acting , etc . Plus , when I dug further , I watched ALL the nominees and found that DAS RAD ( another nominee that failed to win ) was also much better than THE CATHEDRAL . In fact , for originality , DAS RAD definitely was supreme in this category . Still , my advice is see them all - - and perhaps the other Oscar nominees from the 2003 Oscars . They're lovely little short films - - though ATAMA-YAMA might make your brain hurt since it's so very weird .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

This black & white cartoon is another enjoyable example of letting the Pup deal with small cuddly animals invading his turf . Mickey & Minnie have supporting roles only , letting most of the action be carried by Pluto and the furry felines . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

Text2: A tough-as-shoe-leather sergeant patiently molds a rambunctious , rowdy youth into a sturdy Marine . Available again after decades of obscurity , TELL IT TO THE MARINES is a wonderful , rousing paean to America's famous fighting force . Produced with the full cooperation of the Corps , it surges with heartfelt emotion & genuine excitement . It is the kind of film which should be shown to skeptics who doubt the power of silent cinema to satisfy a modern audience . Lon Chaney is beyond praise as the hard-boiled Sergeant O'Hara , who loves the Corps and all that is stands for , but still has a tender heart and a good soul hidden beneath his rough exterior . This was Chaney's favorite role and he plays it without any of the extravagant make-up for which he was so famous . A superb character actor , Chaney became the parts he played . Completely believable , he fascinates the viewer into forgetting that this is an actor they are watching . His early death robbed him from rightfully enjoying the accolades & acclaim which other actors , like Chaplin , reaped in old age . TELL IT TO THE MARINES provided the celebrity-making role for young William Haines and in it he practically revels in the silly billy antics that would dominate the rest of his movie career . In 1930 , only 4 years after the release of this film , Chaney would be dead at the age of 47 and Haines would be the industry's top box office male . Things move fast in Hollywood . Eleanor Boardman is perfect as the crisp Navy nurse who harbors tender feelings for both men . Carmel Myers is the exotic , albeit flea ridden , native girl who tempts Haines . Warner Oland has a small , flashy role as a despicable Chinese bandit . Movie mavens will recognize Willie Fung unbilled as a servant translating for Oland . And what was the Marines ' reaction to this film ? They loved it , and especially Chaney's performance in it and he became the first actor to be awarded an honorary membership in the Corps . The film's shipboard sequences were filmed on the mighty USS California , later to be sunk in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . Where was Lon Chaney when they needed him ? TELL IT TO THE MARINES has been restored to pristine condition & given a rousing new score by Robert Israel .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
724,"Text1: The final season of ' Out Of The Unknown ' , again produced by Alan Bromley , eschewed the science fiction for which the show was renowned , concentrating instead on supernatural tales . Bromley's reasoning was that , in the aftermath of the Apollo moon landings , science fiction was no longer thrilling . He had apparently not noticed the continuing popularity of ' Dr . Who ' and newcomer ' Doomwatch ' over on B . B . C . - 1 , also the U . S . import ' Star Trek ' ( still a comparatively new show at that time ) . ' To Lay A Ghost ' was penned by the talented Michael J . Bird , author of ' Who Pays The Ferryman ' and ' The Lotus Eaters ' . Newlyweds Eric and Diana Carver ( Iain Gregory and Lesley-Anne Down ) move into a country house . Diana was raped when she was fifteen and has never slept with her husband . While developing photographs taken of her in the grounds , Eric notices what appears to be a man in the background , even though no-one else was in shot when the picture was taken . Diana develops a strange obsession with the house , talking to it as though it were a living thing and sleepwalking in the garden at around 2 A . M . Eric gets her to pose with a crossbow , and she tries to shoot him . When a statue falls off a roof , he calls in Phillimore ( Peter Barkworth ) , a psychic investigator . They learn that the house was inhabited years earlier by a madman who raped and killed two woman . Apparently his ghost is in residence . . . A young ( and fabulously beautiful ) Lesley-Anne Down takes up the lead female role here . Three years later , she would move into Eaton Place in the I . T . V . drama ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' as rich brat ' Georgina Worsley ' . As ' Phiilimore ' we get Peter Barkworth and as ever he does not disappoint . This creepy story could never be made now because of the revelation at the end that Diana enjoyed her rape and has waited for years for the same thing to happen again . Even her husband is disgusted , and walks out . For years the fallacy existed that rape was pleasurable for a certain type of woman - Susan George's character in ' Straw Dogs ' certainly seemed to be one , while Ian Fleming in ' Casino Royale ' referred to ' the sweet tang of rape ' - but times have changed . I wish Bird had come up with a different ending . The existing one ruins an otherwise impressive episode . The double meaning in the title was apparently intentional .

Text2: The Spiral Staircase is one of the most eerie and atmospheric films that I have ever had the pleasure of seeing . The entire movie gives off a sense of malice throughout , and the use of music here is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie . The film's plot follows a series of murders , of which all the victims are people with imperfections . Our hero is Helen ; a young mute girl that works as a nurse for Mrs Warren , an old lady that lives in a big house . Aside from the old lady , also living in the house are her two sons ; Albert and Steven , along with a few other people such as the maid . As the murders are being committed on imperfect women , the old lady becomes concerned for her mute nurse and begs her to leave . When another murder is committed in the house , the danger that the young girl is in becomes more apparent . The first thing you will notice about this hidden gem is it's striking cinematography and lush settings . The film is very Gothic , and that gives it a very foreboding atmosphere . This is without doubt the best things about the film ; in a dark thriller such as this , the atmosphere is always important , and as I said ; this film has plenty . The film also features a lot of intrigue . As it has many characters that could be suspects , it leaves you guessing . Playing it's cards very close to it's chest , we don't find out who is the murderer until the very last minute . The cast of The Spiral Staircase don't excel individually , but they come together very well as an ensemble . Most of them would never make another notable movie , although the majority have rather large filmographies . Robert Siodmak takes the directors chair , and he should be commended for his work . His use of the camera is excellent ; the film features numerous close-ups , and when coupled with the haunting music ; it makes for a great eeriness .

Then there's the meteorite thing , was Matthews the only person on the entire planet who thought about firing nuclear weapons into it to change it's course ? Surely the president & his scientific advisor's would have come up with the same conclusion or is it just that Matthews is the cleverest person on Earth ? Some of the logic just isn't very good & rather clunky , just about worth a watch if you don't expect too much . This is definitely an Irwin Allen film with loads of bright garish sets & hideously dated looking computer banks the size of a small shed complete with random flashing lights & computer screens that feature plenty of bad super imposition . The city of Pacifica is obviously a scale model & a not very good one , the main computer control room set was apparently re-dressed & used in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes ( 1972 ) . What was it with Allen & all those flashing random lights anyway ? They were a trademark of the films he made & I don't see their attraction to be honest . I recognised the yellow model ship thing from Allen's TV series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea ( 1964 - 1968 ) . Also , why are the fish & marine life so big ? Huge fish that swim past the windows & the like ? Odd . Technically the film is alright , some of the sets & ' futuristic ' equipment are horribly dated these days & wouldn't even convince a 5 year old . Still that's where part of it's charm & fun comes from I suppose . The acting isn't the best even though there's some good character actor's here , Richard Basehart teams up with Allen again to play the president , Sugar Ray Robinson makes an appearance somewhere along with Whit Bissell , Joseph Cotten & Burr DeBenning all of whom are sadly no longer with us . City Beneath the Sea is an OK sci-fi adventure flick that is relatively undemanding fun in a cheesy & dated sort of way , good enough but not great . Not to be confused with the short lived British TV series City Beneath the Sea ( 1962 ) or the underwater adventure film City Beneath the Sea ( 1953 ) about two divers looking for sunken gold .

Text2: Night Warning begins as Bill ( Gary Baxley ) & Anna Lynch ( Kay Kimler ) leave their young 3 year old son Billy in the care of his Aunt , Cheryl Roberts ( Susan Tyrrell ) and set off for the Pacific Coast to visit their parents . While driving along a mountainside road the brakes on their car fail . Their car speeds out of control and eventually ends up over the side of the mountain and into a river , the car then explodes as a photo of Billy floats downstream . ' 14 Years Later ' , Billy ( Jimmy McNichol ) is now a bright happy 17 year old who lives with his Aunt Cheryl . Cheryl has raised Billy like her own child since his parents were killed , the thing is Cheryl is a little on the mad side , somewhat possessive and rather over-protective but it hasn't been a real problem until now . Now Billy is starting to develop a life of his own , Billy has a girlfriend named Julie ( Julia Duffy , the IMDb listing for this character is wrong . Her name in the film is definitely Julie , not Julia ) and is about to be seen by a Denver University scout and possibly win a full athlete's scholarship . Cheryl openly dislikes both Julie and the fact Billy may have to move to Denver . Having just fixed Cheryl's T . V . set Phil Brody ( Caskey Swaim ) is murdered by Cherly after he rejects her unwanted amorous advances towards himself . Billy comes home to find Cheryl covered in blood holding a large kitchen knife and claiming it was self defence because Brody tried to rape her . Two of Cheryl's friends also turn up , Marge ( Marcia Lewis ) and her husband Frank ( Cooper Neal ) . Lieutenant Joe Carlson ( Bo Svenson ) & Sergeant Cook ( Britt Leach ) are on the case . Neither believe for a second that it was self defence , this theory appears to gain even more credibility when it turns out that Phil Brody was gay & so wouldn't be interested in raping a woman . Carlson becomes more suspicious when it turns out that Phil Brody was in a relationship with Billy's sports coach , Tom Landers ( Steve Eastin ) and therefore it becomes clear that there is a connection between Billy & Brody . Cheryl becomes even more possessive and resorts to drastic measures to make sure that Billy stays with her . No one will take Billy from her and live ! Directed by William Asher Night Warning ( I actually saw the UK version under the much better title Nightmare Maker ) is a strange character driven horror film . The script by Stephen Breimer , Boon Collins & Alan Jay Glueckman concentrates on Cheryl's and Billy's relationship for most of the films running time . And a strange relationship it is too , almost incestuous , over bearing and just plain obsessive . The film tries to touch upon several issues , the weird obsessive relationship , homophobia , gay rights , teenage growing pains & all the while trying to keep the horror aspects of the story going . To be fair the film succeeds for the most part and is fascinating to watch , unfortunately it drags quite badly in places and there isn't a lot of action or violence to maintain ones interest . I wasn't impressed by the silly & slightly rushed ending , either . The acting stands up very well , Tyrrell and McNichol are fine , but it's Bo Svenson's ultra macho homophobic & racist Lieutenant that stays in the memory . I love while interrogating Tyrrell , her friend Marge says "" leave her alone "" to which Carlson replies "" are you talking to me lady ? "" , Marge replies "" yes "" and Carlson simply says "" don't ! "" . And look out for Bill Paxton ( everyones favourite character in Aliens ( 1986 ) ) in an early appearance as Eddie . There are some gory scenes in Night Warning , but not too many and most of them come within the last 15 odd minutes . There is a brief decapitation by tree trunk like the one in Final Destination 2 ( 2003 ) , a stabbing , a cut stomach , a severed hand and a few bloody gunshot wounds . The film has a really bland , flat & made for T . V . look and feel about it . The house where most of the film takes place is dull and visually uninteresting , the music is poor and the cinematography and direction although competent both lack imagination and flair . Overall Night Warning is an interesting horror film that is certainly worth a look , just because it's a little different if nothing else .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
729,"Text1: Misinforming , pompous , self-righteous ( in the figure of the school official played by Joseph Forte ) , TELL YOUR CHILDREN ( better known as REEFER MADNESS ) is usually pushed as one of the worst films ever made . It made the Medved Brothers FIFTY WORST FILMS book , along with such dreck as ROBOT MONSTER , but is revived and revivable more than most of the titles in that list / book . Why ? My guess is that it is more than the idiotic view of marijuana cigarettes and drug addiction . Or the sometimes ridiculous dialog ( why would some teenager state that he never drinks that stuff , meaning he never drinks sodas ? ) . I think it is the fascination this film brings to us because it has things working for it , and it is unique for it's time and place , and it does give us a view of what the public of the 1930s would accept or reject for discussion . I mentioned a few days ago that the movie FLESH AND THE DEVIL ( from the 1920s ) had a bad script which should have built up on a theme of homosexual love between Lars Hanson and John Gilbert , the close friends competing for Greta Garbo . But , as I said , the America of Calvin Coolidge would not tolerate open discussion of homosexuality . So the two male stars had to use their all to show their friendship was deeper than a friendship . Similarly drug addiction was not a topic of deep discussion in the 1920s or 1930s or earlier . Yet it existed . Mark Twain , in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY , mentions Charles Webster , his business partner whose mistakes caused the failure of their publishing house , as addicted to over-the-counter drugs , and states that in America ( in the 1890s ) it was easy to become a self-poisoner this way . That comment is the sole one I have ever found in 19th Century literature regarding drug addiction , and Twain's Autobiography was not completely published until the 1960s , edited by Charles Neider . The movie record is tricky . I have seen only two films that mention drugs at all . One is Charlie Chaplin's EASY STREET , where the tramp ( here a policeman confronting Eric Campbell and his gang in a slum ) accidentally sits on a needle with some drug ( cocaine , I suspect ) and it gives his adrenalin a lift . The other is another Chaplin film ( whose title I unfortunately can't recall ) wherein somebody is shown using the "" notorious nose powders "" . Leave it to America's greatest writer and the English-born film giant to be the only two who had the guts to discuss the matter . But aside from them there was nothing . No film of stature was made of the trafficking in drugs until TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH . . . IN THE 1940s ! Hard to believe isn't it ? Yet we know , if studying the history of organized crime and earlier criminals , that gangs did deal in drugs . It was even then a big business . Capone had a whole section of his empire in Chicago devoted to drug sales , along with prostitution , with illegal booze , and with union racketeering . But it rarely was talked about . Can anyone recall a film with Robinson or Cagney or Raft or Bogart dealing with drugs ? The Chinese opium trade was an exception : but it was basically seen as involving Chinese addicts only , not most Americans ( a very naive view , but one clung to by most Americans ) . Now into this hole comes this two-bit film which tries to tackle the threat of drugs to American Youth . It would not be until Samuel Fuller's UNDERWORLD USA in the 1950s that the subject is tackled again so forcefully ( Fuller , being a better director , and having Cliff Robertson and Robert Emhart in his cast , does better with the subject ) . So from want of any alternative , REEFER MADNESS is in a unique position to be notable from the start . It also is lucky to have at least two notable actors . Dave O'Brien is better recalled for the many Pete Smith comedy shorts he did , but his "" Ralph "" driven crazy to kill another character by reefers is his best remembered performance . Actually , while we realize today that reefers don't do that kind of damage to most people as this film suggests , O'Brien shows by his skittishness and twisting precisely what drug addiction to say cocaine or morphine would do to people - particularly when he is forced into hiding and is somewhat going cold turkey at times . He had done his homework , if the screenwriters did not . The other was Carleton Young . Young would become among the last actors adopted in the John Ford circle in the late 1950s and early 1960s , most notably in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALENCE and SERGEANT RUTLEDGE . Under that master's hands he gave wonderful performances . His performance as the drug dealer Jack Perry is a fair one , given the lesser director he has here . So the film does have some things going for it , even if it over the top in condemning reefers over stronger drugs . I know it is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination , but it is not the worst film in the world - it's the best bad film of the 1930s .

Text2: Farces are made in the dramas of all countries , but they are usually the most difficult things to push from one state to another . Language is the chief problem , but also there is the issue of what one country considers a farce as opposed to another . Britain's best known farce ( that remains in repertoire ) is Brandom Thomas's CHARLIE'S AUNT . It's main peg is the two act female impersonation act of the hero , Lord Fancourt Baberley , as the aunt of his college chum , with all the attending complications concerning two elderly suitors , his own romantic pursuit , and the arrival of the actual lady he is pretending to be . While England has sex farces ( plenty of them ) , their best farce plays spoof the conventions . Michael Frayn's comedy NOISES OFF , about third rate actors putting on a fifth rate farce for far too long , is quite typical . But the French stuck to sexual subjects - particularly the idea of illicit sex and assignations . And the master of this was Georges Feydeau , probably their most revivable dramatist of the "" Belle Epoque "" ( 1890 - 1914 ) . When one thinks of a farce as one where people are running from one room to another , just missing each other by seconds , it is Feydeau that most people think about . It's like his signature . However , like reading any foreign writer , that writer is best read in his or her native tongue . Feydeau is a witty writer , but his farces become mechanical marvels only in English translation . You need a top cast and director to overcome the loss of language . In 1958-59 Alec Guinness appeared in a London stage production of HOTEL PARADISO , a Feydeau farce . It was quite a success on the West End ( an American production at that time also starred Bert Lahr ) . But the film version was not made until 1966 . It is a highly amusing film , but it lacks the verve needed to make it a totally successful farce on film . The cast is good . Guinness is Benedict Boniface , who is an architect married to his wife Angelique ( Peggy Mount ) . Ms Mount may be named Angelique , but she is no angel - she is bossy . Their neighbors are Henri and Marcelle Cot ( Robert Morley and Gina Lolabrigida ) . He too is an architect , but is frequently consulted on building problems . He has been asked to check a hotel that may have pipe problems , or noises that could be a ghost . Lolabrigida is angry that Morley is again putting his work ahead of their marriage , but he insists he has no choice due to his court appointed duty . But Guinness intends to take advantage of his wife's temporary absence to visit an ailing relative to traipse off with Lolabrigida . In the meantime there are additional problems regarding a visiting attorney ( Douglas Byng ) and his four daughter , and Morley's nephew ( Douglas Fowles - the assistant to Paul Eddington on YES MINISTER ) and Guinness's maid ( Anne Beach ) . All the characters end up at the rather tacky HOTEL PARADISO , which is run by Akim Tamiroff with the assistance ( ? ) of David Battley . Others in the hotel that night are a Turk , a prominent singer and her lover a British Duke , and a writer . . . actually two writers - the director of the film Peter Glanville plays Feydeau , a neighbor of the Boniface and Cot families , who is watching the antics , and deciding on what his next play is going to be like . The performances are good , but they tend to be sluggish at too many points . And the translation to English from the French seems to leave out too many verbal jokes . The film as a whole is well mounted , and amusing . But it is minor Guinness , despite his having been successful in the stage production seven years earlier .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: Group of teens ( forming four boyfriend-girlfriend couple ) , just recently graduated from high school , decide to stay overnight in a furniture store to have a little sex , but have no clue that a killer awaits them . . a transvestite psycho at that ! The film opens the door that a recently released con , who needed a job and place to stay , is bedding in a room on the bottom floor . John ( Sean Kanan ) is the son of the furniture store's owner and takes the rest on a tour of the massive multi-floored building with it's bevy full of mannequins creating a creepy decor . When asked why his father would have all these mannequins stored throughout , John says it makes the customers feel that someone's always at home . So anytime a teen bumps into a mannequin , they jump because you never know if it is someone with flesh not plastic . They keep the lights off so that no one will spot them inside fooling around which even increases the danger and scary-factor of the mannequins for they are always there popping up when the characters come around corners . They decide to play a game of hide-and-seek within the furniture store while also taking time out to have sexual relations in the numerous beds on the different floors available to them . This furniture store becomes a playground for the killer as he can come upon them unannounced , often hiding within the mannequins in the darkness . What's his purpose for killing them ? You have to see it to believe it ! It's absolutely an outrageous reason . Gloriously lame late-80's cheese-ball slasher with hammy overacting by the young cast made with style thanks to the darkened , enormous setting inside the huge furniture store . Multi-levels provides plenty of room for the killer to hide and attack his prey . The idea that he is amongst them without their knowledge also allows a slow build-up until he strikes .

731,"Text1: I just saw Trading Places in its true entirety for the first time in many years . I have often caught various scenes on TV but never sat down and watched it since first viewing long ago . My opinion remains the same . I'm a big fan of Eddie Murphy , a pretty big fan of Dan Aykroyd , and in general ' 80s comedies and SNL - - but this one is a bit too long ( over 120 mins , uncut and unedited w / commercials on television ) - - it does have some very funny sequences and in particular the beginning is great but after that it sort of goes downhill . I thought the plot was incredibly weak and a bit too contrived - - Aykroyd's sudden complete loss of . . . everything was wholly unbelievable . I suppose it could be somewhat believable if not for the fact that Eddie Murphy suddenly replaces him and no one else seems to notice , or care . No business colleagues notice what is going on , etc . Then there's the scene where Aykroyd is walking by the restaurant and sees them all inside . He HAD to know what was going on when he saw Don Ameche with Eddie Murphy . He had to know they had set him up . Why didn't he just go into the restaurant and confront them ? Yeah , it's "" just a comedy "" or "" just a movie "" but there's a difference between suspension of disbelief ( which I don't mind at all - - I own Commando ! ) and being downright stupid . It's the little stuff like this I don't like . It starts out as a fairly realistic comedy but is waaay too silly and over-the-top at times . ( E . g . the guy getting put in with a gorilla - funny for a slapstick like Naked Gun , perhaps , but not for an otherwise realistic comedy . ) It would at least be fun if it weren't so long ! There are long gaps were nothing really happens . Many punchlines are clearly supposed to be funny , but aren't . There's an entire scene where Murphy is being given instructions about how Wall Street works and it goes on for about two minutes , before he says "" You two sound like a coupl'a bookies to me . "" It's supposed to be the punchline to the scene , but it takes so long getting to it , and frankly , it just isn't very funny . Eddie Murphy is usually good at creating likable characters , or at least funny ones , but his character here seemed to just disappear and reappear so often I never really felt as if I was getting to know him - - he seemed more like a co-star . Dan Aykroyd gives a much better performance in general ( or at least he has better material to work with in regards to his character ) . I prefer Beverly Hills Cop ( my favorite Eddie performance ) , The Blues Brothers , Coming to America ( with a clever reference to Trading Places ) and even the mediocre ( but entirely watchable and enjoyable ) Great Outdoors to this . "" Trading Places "" is OK but certainly not the classic many seem to think it is . It's too long with too many unfunny scenes , the plot is a bit too unbelievable to take seriously , the characters are all over the place and this all creates a cold distance - - it's hard for me to warm up to the movie , I guess .

Text2: I'm a huge fan of Robert De Niro . I've made an effort to hunt down all of his older films ( like Greetings and the awful "" Sam's Song "" a . k . a . "" The Swap "" ) and have done pretty well so far - I saw "" Born to Win "" at a grocery store for six bucks on DVD and since I'd seen it listed on IMDb as one of his early films ( and after making sure it wasn't one of the countless "" other titles "" for "" Sam's Song "" ) I purchased it . Much to my surprise ( well , not really , I kinda suspected as much ) the cover was totally deceiving . It features Robert De Niro's face ( from another film , mind you ) , his hand holding a gun . It says , "" ROBERT DE NIRO "" and "" George Segal "" in smaller print underneath his name . The tagline on the DVD is something like , "" A junkie goes against a cop trying to bring down Mr . Big . "" Now , mind you , no one in this film is named Mr . Big , and the junkie ( Segal ) doesn't "" go against "" the cop . De Niro the Cop is only in TWO scenes ( count ' em , two ) and has maybe a page's worth of dialogue , if that . The film relies on Segal and he really delivers a fine performance . The entire cast is good - Hector Elizondo and Karen Black in supporting roles , as well as a younger Burt Young ( pre - "" Rocky "" ) . This isn't a great film and it isn't superbly directed . It's a bit hard to watch at times due to a grainy transfer and bad audio . But it's reminiscent of Al Pacino's "" Panic in Needle Park "" so far as it presents a realistic , gritty , depressing vision of junkies operating on the streets , and how miserable your life can become by resorting to drugs ( mainly heroin ) .

This could be called "" more innocents "" but there's a strong difference between the two works . Although "" our mother's house "" verges on fantastic , there's nothing irrational , nothing supernatural here . THat's what we can call a miracle of a movie : because it sounds like a horror and fantasy movie without all the genre gimmicks . So people who're looking for gore , special effects and other paraphernalia , please pass by . If you enjoy strong screenplays , first-class performances and masterful direction , this is a must . Eight children whose mother's just passed away want to go on with their life as if nothing happened . Besides , they do believe that their mother is still with them , and Pamela Franklin ' s rendering is absolutely stunning when she acts as some kind of medium : far from the usual clichés - as you can see in "" ghost "" for instance - , she will give you goose pimples . This mother will remain a mystery , maybe a saint steeped in piety , maybe somebody much worse than a goody-two-shoes , as Charlie eventually claims . Charlie is masterfully portrayed by Dirk Bogarde who was in his more fruitful period with such masterpieces as "" accident "" "" king and country "" "" la caduti dei degi "" "" morte a Venezio "" . He keeps people waiting for he only appears after about forty minutes . But when he's on the screen , the chemistry between the thespian and the children is so obvious that there's no hiatus . At first sight , he resembles some adult Peter Pan ( hairdo , swagger , clothes , not to forget the name : Hook ! ) . Here , where Spielberg dismally failed when he made "" Hook "" , Jack Clayton with a much smaller budget had already succeeded in portraying an adult / child , more than twenty years before . But further acquaintance will show that an adult can no longer remain a child . When Charlie is a man again , tragedy is waiting around the corner . "" Our mother's house "" is so rich a movie that you could stay all night talking about it : a twilight glow shines on an autumnal suburb and turns into absolute darkness for the last sequence . Georges Delerue's score is simply marvelous and enhances the perfection of the pictures . A strong influence on the French movie "" la fracture du myocarde "" . See it at any cost .

"" House of the Dead 2 "" is not so bad as indicated in many reviews in IMDb , actually it is an entertaining and gore zombie action movie . The silly beginning recalls "" American Pie "" , with many partially naked women , and then the story shifts to a funny zombie movie .

I do not play the game , but I like zombie and trash movies , therefore I believe this film is underrated for fans of this genre . Title ( Brazil ) : "" House of the Dead 2 - A Casa dos Mortos 2 ""

Text2: ' The Young Lions ' is the Second War II presented through the participation of three soldiers . Christian Diestl ( Marlon Brando ) is an idealistic German , son of a shoemaker . He joins the Army believing that life could improve in Germany under the administration of the Nazis . However , being a soldier , he cannot accept ' acting like a police ' in an occupied Paris and requests transference to the front , where he has another disappointment with the cruelty of the war . Noah Ackerman ( Montgomery Clift ) is a shy American Jew , a very simple man , just married with Hope Plowman ( Hope Lange ) and very discriminated in his platoon for being Jew . He goes to the war and leaves his family . Michael Whiteacre ( Dean Martin ) is a successful actor who became friend of Noah while in New York and is also obliged to join the army and go to London . There , he decides to leave the office activity and join his platoon in the front . This movie is excellent . It shows common people being used by government in a senseless war . All the main characters are peaceful common persons : Christian is a very simple person , wishing to climb socially in life in a Germany without opportunities and is misguided by the speech of Hitler and pretty soon he becomes aware how stupid war is . Noah is also a very simple person , a salesman from a department store , who indeed wishes to be with his family and join the Army just for obligation . And Michael is a selfish actor and bon vivant , without any sense of patriotism and who is not interest in anything but to have his life back . These characters are put together in a stupid war , having to kill persons to save their lives and to obey orders , which they do not agree .

There never has been a movie like this before and there most likely will never be one again . Once when I was switching channels I came across the last hour of "" Ravenous "" . Even though I had no idea what happened in the first part of the movie I was still intrigued by the movie and couldn't keep my eyes of the screen . I was both entertained and thrilled by it . I remember especially that the unusual but fitting musical score by Damon Albarn and Michael Nyman grabbed my attention . This was a year or so ago and now finally I have seen this entire movie in total ! The movie features some highly all in a way eccentric characters but it never goes over-the-top or becomes ridiculous . It makes the movie entertaining but also keeps the other more exciting and mysterious moments of the movie powerful and thrilling . Robert Carlyle is especially good as the main ' villain ' and Guy Pearce is also highly believable in his role as cowardly captain during the Mexican-American war . The two of them really carry this movie and are supported by an highly talented supporting cast consisting out of ; the always enjoyable Jeffrey Jones , Jeremy Davies in a typical role for him , David Arquette in an highly amusing role and Neal McDonough , now better known perhaps for his role in "" Band of Brothers "" and "" Minority Report "" . If you're in for something totally new and refreshing and / or you are a fan of the horror genre this is simply a must see for you !

Text2:  The Lion King  is and will always will be regarded as one of the better Disney movies . And it deserves that ! First of all the movie looks visually splendid ! The African land scape's are beautiful and so are the animations of the animals itself . What makes "" The Lion King "" such a special movie is the emotional dept the story has . The story plays a significant role in the movie and it has some good adult moments . The entire movie has a more of an adult feeling , unlike earlier made Disney's that mainly focused on only young children . Still there also is plenty to enjoy for the young ones , especially the characters Timon and Pumbaa shall be loved by them . The story is filled with symbolism and reference to mainly the communist regime . The voice cast is good , mainly of course thanks to James Earl Jones who has an amazing good deep voice . Also the three hyenas are voiced perfectly by Whoopi Goldberg , Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings . Jeremy Irons who voices the main villain Scar really brings his character to live and makes the movie even more worth watching . There are some typical Disney songs that are good . Also surprising good is the musical score itself composed by Hans Zimmer who also received an Oscar for it . His first and only one but hopefully not his last .

It takes itself far too seriously to allow suspension of disbelief required to enjoy this kind of work .

Soon , they're both being followed by an eager pack of hunters . "" The Bear "" features several eloquent and lovely moments , captured beautifully on film by director Jean-Jacques Annaud , though unfortunately the film as a whole isn't especially worthwhile . The animals are manipulated into action for the sake of thrills , some of which have a brutal edge , leaving an uncomfortable pall hanging over the project . Ultimately , it's an old-fashioned adventure story with a sincere appreciation for the bears involved , yet it doesn't leave one feeling very satisfied . from

Text2: An ancient prophet of doom lures a writer for the Washington Post to a small town in West Virginia ( named Point Pleasant ! ) where a tragedy is soon to befall the community . Handsomely-produced spook-story runs rampant with nonsense , much of it laughable : red herrings , ringing phones , hallucinations that serve no purpose , and a supporting character who hears voices coming out of his bathroom sink ! In the lead , Richard Gere isn't really invested in this material ( and worse , he looks bloated and beady-eyed ) , but he does keep a straight face , as does Laura Linney as a policewoman who eventually tires of Gere's warnings ( something the viewer can instantly identify with ) . The story , adapted from John Keel's book , is actually quite engrossing , but this screenplay is far too complicated , and the direction too ritzy , to qualify as a satisfying thriller .

743,"Text1: ' Haiducii ' is the centrepiece of a trilogy of Roumanian films directed by Horia Igirosanu , dramatising the struggle of the Roumanian people to overthrow the tyrannical Pharinote : the Greek regents installed by the Holy Roman Empire as rulers of Roumania . The first film in the triptych is ' Iancu Jlanu ' ( 1928 ) ; the conclusion is ' Cioceii ' ( 1931 ) . I saw ' Haiducii ' in July 1996 at the Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna ; they screened a print with the original intertitles , from Roumania's Arhiva Nationala de Filme . This one movie in the trilogy covers events from 1812 through 1817 , with the revolution of 1821 left for the third film to cover . Much of the action in ' Haiducii ' is seen from the viewpoint of two young Roumanian sisters , Ileana ( Ana Ciobanu ) and Victorita ( Iva Dugan ) . When Ileana is kidnapped by the Pharinote , Victorita disguises herself as a boy and takes the name Mihaita , then tries to rescue her sister by infiltrating the group of soldiers commanded by Mereanu ( Cristache Antoniu ) , a haiduco . Actor Cristian Niculescu is good as Vulpe , a rival haiduco . The Pharinote have seized the inn owned by Tunsu ( portrayed by the one-named actor Titiandrescu ) , and they use this as their headquarters . Tunsu , enraged , joins the struggle to overthrow the regents . Eventually , after fighting alongside the ' boy ' Mihaita , Mereanu discovers that he's actually a girl named Victorita . The two promptly fall in love , not forgetting their struggle for political freedom . Oh , goulash ! I found this movie deeply unsatisfying . Part of the problem is that this is , after all , the middle section of a trilogy . . . so I've come into some material in mid-progress , and other plot points are left hanging for the conclusion . Fair enough , except that this movie is unsatisfying for other reasons as well . I confess that I know absolutely nowt about this chapter in Roumanian history , yet I get a very strong sensation that Ileana and Victorita , as well as several other characters here , are outright fictional characters , or composites at best . I've never objected to the device of placing fictional characters in actual historical events ( I've done this myself , as a novelist ) , but it bothers me very much when the fictional characters start controlling those events , for instance when they're shown here winning battles that actually were won and lost by real-life individuals . This film is made even more ludicrous by the device of Victorita fighting alongside Mereanu whilst disguised as a boy . Mereanu is entirely fooled , which raises questions about his perceptive abilities , and he accepts this ' boy ' as a valid comrade-at-arms . But as soon as Mereanu learns the truth about Victorita , he is attracted to her so quickly that I can't help wondering if he'd had any of those same feelings for her when he thought she was a boy . Normally , when I've seen only a portion of a film , I shan't rate it . In this case , I've seen only one-third of a trilogy . . . but each movie in the trilogy was released separately and was meant to stand on its own merits , so ' Haiducii ' is to some extent a complete and self-contained entity . If the other two instalments are as implausible and chaotic as this one , then all three are very bad indeed . I realise that some Roumanians ( or some people of Roumanian descent ) will be angered that I have so little esteem for a movie about a crucial period in that nation's history . The reason I dislike this movie so much is not due to any antipathy towards the Roumanians , but because this film's Roumanian director has done such a very bad job of dramatising that material . I'll rate ' Haiducii ' just one point in ten .

Text2: ' The Guilty Generation ' has a misleading title . This movie would seem to indict a generation , but it's actually more interested in indicting an ethnic group . . . to be precise , the Italians . This movie takes place in a universe where everyone named Angelo or Luigi is automatically a gangster . Late in the film , there's some brief dialogue about honest Italians vilifying the crooked members of their ' race ' . . . but most of this movie seems to indicate that Italian ancestry and criminal behaviour are mutually inclusive . Robert Young is a rising young architect named John Smith , a name guaranteed to attract attention . Indeed , we soon find out that he was born Marco Ricca , son of gangster Tony Ricca . The latter is played by Boris Karloff , looking not remotely Italian . ( Although Italian-American actor Abe Vigoda was a Karloff lookalike . ) Karloff brings deep conviction and presence to this role , but his performance is not very convincing . Part of the problem is that Tony Ricca's dialogue is full of "" ain't "" s and other grammatical errors , yet Karloff speaks these thick-eared lines in his usual cultured tones . Elsewhere , Murray Kinnell is good in a supporting role , but his well-bred English accent seems out of place in a setting that's knee-deep in goombahs . There are excellent performances by two actors unknown to me , Emma Dunn and Elliott Rothe . Also impressive is Leo Carrillo . Because of his short stature and thick accent , Carrillo is best known for comic roles . Here , he's chillingly believable as a crime lord , utterly ruthless and unforgiving . Much of the film takes place in the sumptuous Florida mansion owned by Carrillo's character . I was astounded that Columbia Pictures - - at this point , a studio barely out of Poverty Row - - were able to achieve these production values . Also quite good , in a supporting role , is Ruth Warren as Carrillo's press agent . Unfortunately , Warren was precisely the same character type as several other better-known and better actresses - - Jean Dixon and Glenda Farrell spring to mind - - so she failed to claim a niche for herself among Hollywood's character actresses . As the romantic leads in this melange , Robert Young and the insipid Constance Cummings are as dull as dishwater . I've never yet seen a performance by Cummings that impressed me . ' The Guilty Generation ' , well-directed by the underrated Rowland V Lee , and nicely photographed by Byron Haskin , is probably of greatest interest to Karloff fans . Be advised that Karloff's role is actually quite small , and he's miscast . Overall , I'll rate this movie .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
744,"Text1: Once again there is only one previous comment for this film , once again it is written by a Frenchman living in France and once again it registers disappointment . How I wish I could be so blase ' about French films of the 30s / 40s and let's face it , I probably would be if I could turn on my television set and see examples seven days a week but alas that will never be the case in England so I will continue to harvest them where I can - not least from that very same critic - salivate as I savour the names on the credits - in this case Gabrielle Fontan , Marguerite Moreno , Suzy Prim , Jean Tissier , Pierre Larquey and Robert Le Vigan - and subsequently probably overpraise . At a time when Japan was very much an enemy it was arguably brave to assign the leading role to an actress born in Tonkin ; Foun-sen had established a modest reputation in French cinema and had already appeared in L'Alibi , Drole de Drame and Mollenard among others and here she plays Renee Menard who has come to Paris bent on finding the father who abandoned her . Fortuitously there are several Paul Menards in the telephone directory and she works her way through a representative collection which is , basically , the plot . Bernard Roland was a journeyman director who did make one excellent movie , Portrait d'un Assassin , from a script by Henri Decoin , and this is very much a journeyman effort . Jacques Viot's screenplay reminds us that not EVERY film made in France from the thirties through the fifties was written by one of the GREAT FOUR - Jacques Prevert , Charles Spaak , Henri Jeanson , Jean Aurenche - it just seems that way and most of the films that were seen outside France were the work of one of the four ( five , if you include Pierre Bost , who was Aurenche's writing partner from 1943 ) . Viot had , as it happened , worked on Le Jour se leve with Prevert and it clearly went to his head ( he also worked on the dire American version , The Long Night ) , possibly because he worked with Prevert's best collaborator , Marcel Carne on L'Air de Paris and Juliette ou le clef des songes but of course there is only one Jacques Prevert and it isn't Jacques Viot , not by a country mile . Nevertheless the film is entertaining and , to someone like me , priceless as an example of French cinema BG ( before Godard ) .

Text2: I appreciate Sunset the film because it gave the man who I consider the best big screen Wyatt Earp , James Garner , a chance to reprise the role . Garner played Earp back in the mid sixties in John Sturges's Hour of the Gun . That film took the unusual plot line of beginning with the famous Gunfight at the OK Corral and showing the aftermath from that event . It was a pretty grim western , and Garner was not playing his usual likable con artist . It took twenty years from Hour of the Gun to Sunset , but it was over 40 years in real life from the OK Corral fight until the events of Sunset that take place in Hollywood in and around the first Academy Award dinner in 1928 . Wyatt Earp was in fact in Hollywood and did in fact know Tom Mix . Earp died in 1929 at the age 80 and Garner is one of the liveliest 80 year olds ever on screen . Blake Edwards must have hated Charles Chaplin because Malcolm McDowell as Alfie Alperin , the Happy Hobo and villain of the film is one loathsome creep . No doubt Chaplin's character is used as the basis for McDowell's . The famous Thomas Ince shooting on board a yacht is also worked into the plot . Topping all that the first Academy Award dinner had a triple homicide in the lobby . Bruce Willis as Tom Mix stars as Wyatt Earp in a film about the OK Corral and of course with Wyatt still being alive , Garner is brought in as a technical adviser . The two of them get involved in a lovely web of intrigue during end of the silent era that starts with the murder of a bordello madam who had a lot of blackmail information concerning the mighty of Tinseltown . Wyatt Earp discovers a few personal facts about himself he didn't know also . Patricia Hodge is McDowell's long suffering wife and Jennifer Edwards is his equally loathsome sister . Another pair that Willis and Garner have to deal with are Richard Bradford as a corrupt LA detective and M . Emmet Walsh as the studio cop who do a lot of McDowell's dirty work . Sunset is entertaining enough , not a great film for either Willis or Garner . And it does capture the ambiance of old Hollywood , give or take a lie or two .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

And , chained up in a little alcove , a woman . Or is it ? She looks human , she's actually kind of cute , that is , until you get a good look at her teeth . He brings her back to his apartment where he keeps her , but she won't eat , won't drink , won't speak . What he accidentally finds out is that she does drink something , and that's blood . And he couldn't have guessed that from her teeth ? He hasn't watched enough movies .

John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune ! I mean that's a bit like having a film where the hero's an environmentalist who goes around blowing oil rigs to save the Alaskan wilderness . Oh wait a minute didn't Steven Seagal . . . . Despite this incredible and vain attempt at character development there follows much dialogue that accurately reflects what is going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s . The Soviet - Afghan war actually intensified when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and by that time over one million Afghans had died in the conflict while as many as five million had been forced over the border into Iran and Pakistan as what analysts at the time called "" Migratory genocide "" , a euphemism that people nowadays would describe as "" Ethnic cleansing "" . There's other parts of the film that points out that screenwriter Sheldon Lettich has done his homework on the conflict with factual things like Soviet conscripts defecting to the Mujahedeen , of the red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and of the Soviets use of chemical weapons which almost certainly proves that the sloppy script of FIRST BLOOD PART 2 was mainly down to James Cameron than Stallone , but as you'd expect in this type of action adventure movie the script rapidly degenerates into a series of set pieces of an all American superman blowing up a bunch of nasty commies who can't shoot straight . Ah well at least the main commie isn't played by a British actor unlike in the last film . Oh and congratulations to Peter McDonald for at least trying to make a Puma helicopter look like a Soviet helicopter gunship .

The Taliban were created in Pakistan in the early 1990s , took over Afghanistan in 1995 and were led by Mullah Omar . The Mujahedeen were split into several different groups and were led by different leaders ( None of them called Bin Laden ) most of them forming a coalition against the Taliban called the Northern Alliance in . Their overall leader was the legendary guerilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was murdered in a suicide bombing by Al Qai'da terrorists in September 2001 . It was the Northern Alliance who fought side by side with the Western coalition during their campaign to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 to the present day

All of them think the house was creepy even before some loud bumps and stuff started happening , but when a blood covered hammer appears on a pillow , they wonder whether the creators of the show are trying to make them crack . They also get a visitor with Travis Patterson ( Bradley Cooper ) , and it is when one of them is found dead from hanging himself , they investigate the information about the show they are on , which they were never told the name of . It soon becomes obvious that one of them wants the money more than anyone , and is willing to do anything the creators want to get it . It might appeal to the Big Brother-YouTube generation who like both reality shows and internet videos , but I can't really say it is fantastic , see it at least once . Okay !

Text2: The third and final part of J . R . R . Tolkien's most celebrated trilogy is by far the best of the three films .

During this very long monologue , the other lady says absolutely nothing but conveys some messages through her facial expressions . In the end , you are left wondering what really occurred as well as the back story . This is a production created by a Kentucky community college . Considering its humble origins , the film is far better than you'd expect - - showing very good camera work as well as decent acting . The problem is that the one act play itself just didn't do much for me - - particularly as the resolution was a bit too vague and unsatisfying .

You wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night , and neither would I , as this guy is nasty with a capital ' N ' . He approaches his role as the action hero-esquire secret government agent thingy with gusto and really makes you believe that he has the hard man ability to run a corporation with an iron fist .

Actually , I think this movie would be better without Hutton in it at all . Think about it ; we could just follow the escapades of John Glover's character . If John Glover , or anyone else with stature in the movie industry would like to get in touch with me about the possibility of a trilogy of spin-off's ( probably called ' The Chronicles of John Glover ' ) , just drop me a line as I have some great ideas . Anyway , I don't know what happened in the end because I fell asleep with about fifteen minutes to go , but I like to think that it ended with a bunch of Hutton's mates coming into the final scene with a keg of beer , saying "" April Fools "" , and then Hutton and his friends laugh the whole incident off while saying things like "" I cant believe you thought that you were a half man , half robot assassin prototype ; you didn't even doubt the story for a second !

Text2: The Haunted starts with a load of scrolling text that claims the film is based on true events blah , blah , blah you know the sort of thing . It's ' Halloween 1955 ' & Janet Smurl ( Sally Kirkland ) remembers her childhood & the spooky stories that surround a house in her town . Jump forward to ' August 1975 ' , Janet & her husband Jack ( Jeffrey DeMunn ) their two young daughters & Jack's Mum & Dad Mary ( Louise Latham ) & John ( George Wallace ) move into that very same house . At first things go well except for a few minor harmless unexplained occurrences . Now jump forward to ' March 1985 ' when the real trouble begins , Janet has had a further two daughters but things take a sinister turn for the worse . Janet begins to hear voices , she sees a ghost , electrical fires & all sorts of paranormal phenomena that gradually gets more & more threatening . The Smurl's seek help from the Church but they refuse to perform an exorcism , then they turn to psychic detectives & finally the press in a desperate attempt to rid their house of the ghosts & stop the family from being driven apart . Directed by Robert Mandel I thought The Haunted was a dull supernatural horror film . The script by Darrah Cloud is based on a book co-written by Janet & Jack Smurl ( probably the real ones ! ) & offers nothing new or exciting to the haunted house horror sub-genre , one of my least favourite type's of horror films . I've always found these type's of films really dull & predictable , I mean people hearing sinister voices , things opening & closing on their own , lights exploding & lots of boring melodramatics involving the break down of a family unit , it's all here , it hardly gets the pulse racing & The Haunted does nothing to distinguish itself from loads of other boring haunted house tales . The origins of the ghosts are almost left totally unexplained as is the throwaway line that puberty ( the two daughters grow up which is why it takes 10 years before the serious stuff starts to kick in ) in someway gives the spirits their powers & you can't help but feel if they had just moved it would have saved a lot of trouble & emotional anguish on their parts ! Having said that I suppose on a certain level it's watchable , the character's are OK , it moves along at a sedate pace but it's never excruciatingly boring & the supernatural activity is not too overblown or silly . The Haunted does what it sets out to do I suppose , it's far from the best or most exciting film ever but I've seen worse & I can't really criticize any specific part of it other than personally didn't really like it . Average at best . Director Mandel turns in a really lifeless film , it's bland , forgettable , flat , does not have one single scary scene in it & lacks any sort of atmosphere . The house chosen is just so ordinary & the film never builds or sustains any sort of tension or threat . The Haunted feels more like a family drama / soap opera as much as it does a horror , since I was hoping for a horror I can't say anything else other than I was disappointed by it . Technically this made-for-TV film lives up to that billing , the whole film feels & looks like the cheap TV film that it most definitely is . It's competently made & that's the best thing I say say about it , just don't expect a visual treat ! The acting was decent enough but I don't particularly remember anyone from it in either a positive or negative way . The Haunted is an adequate ghost film , it didn't do anything for me but I will concede that maybe there is an audience for a film such as this out there , somewhere . If you like dull soap opera melodramatics in your films then The Haunted is for you , if however you like decent horror , atmosphere , scares & a bit of excitement then I suggest that The Haunted most definitely isn't for you .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
754,"Text1: Here's a very unlikely and peculiar fright feature : an early 70's NBC-TV musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic Victorian-era novella with an unusually cast Kirk Douglas in the dual role of the good-hearted , blandly respectable Dr . Jekyll and his evil , lusty , gleefully immoral and animalistic id-run-amok alter ego Mr . Hyde . What's most surprising about this audaciously imaginative enterprise is how to a sizable degree it works extremely well . There's no denying that the schizophrenic titular part is any true actor's dream role ; Douglas clearly knows this and gladly sinks his teeth into the part , playing the two wildly contrasting characters with lip-smacking brio . The rest of the cast is made up of top-drawer British thespians : Susan Hampshire radiates considerable charm as Jekyll's fiancé , Sir Michael Redgrave portrays Hampshire's prim'n'proper gentleman father to stuffy perfection , Donald Pleasence simply delights as a petty , scraggly street peddler , Susan George has a grand bawdy time as a fiercely proud and blithely naughty saloon showgirl , and Stanley Holloway displays an appropriate amount of concern as Jekyll's loyal , worried butler . Sherman Yellen's script astutely captures the repressive mores and scientific curiosity which defined late 19th century London . The lavish costumes and fog-shrouded sets vividly evoke the period . The score by Lionel Bart , Mel Mandell and Norman Sachs is rather hit-or-miss , supplying a decidedly mixed bag of tunes which range from mediocre and forgettable to lively and enjoyable . The better songs are good , jaunty fun , distinguished by especially catchy and witty lyrics . The cast belt out the songs with terrifically infectious aplomb ; it's a real treat to see Douglas , Pleasence and the underrated George cheerfully rip into their numbers . Alas , there are a few glaring flaws which gum things up to a fair extent : pedestrian , workmanlike direction by David Winters ( who later helmed the laughably bad Joe Spinell psycho vehicle "" The Last Horror Film "" ) , flat cinematography , and a blurry , rough-on-the-eyes shot-on-video look that results in an ugly and unappealing visual texture . These faults asides , this picture still holds up as an admirably fresh and novel take on an often-told hoary old chestnut creepy tale .

Writer / director Don Coscarelli delivers a charming and warm-hearted little gem about 70's suburbanite adolescence that's remarkably bereft of both sour cynicism and cloying sentimentality ; instead the rambling episodic narrative ambles along in a most delightfully breezy'n'easy manner and offers plenty of spot-on moving and / or amusing moments . Better still , the cute cast of personable kid thespians all come through with appealingly naturalistic performances : McCann and Baldwin positively shine in the leads , receiving fine support from Jeff Roth as pesky , yet lovable little squirt Sherman , Terrie Kalbus as fetching blonde babe Marcy , and Eswin Cajas as foreign exchange student Paco . Plus there are nice turns by Reggie Bannister as friendly , understanding teacher Mr . Donovan , Ralph Richmond as Doug's jolly government agent father Big Doug , Kenneth J .

Crooks Wanda ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) and her lover Otto ( Kevin Kline ) have successfully stolen millions of dollars worth of diamonds from a bank in London , England , along with George and a stuttering animal-lover , Ken ( Michael Palin ) . They hide the stash in a safe , then pretend that they will meet back in three days to fly somewhere away from England . But George goes back , hides the stash in an airport security deposit box , and puts the key to the safe in his pocket . However , he doesn't realize that Wanda and Otto are planning to turn him in to the police and take the loot for themselves . They do so , only one problem : When they go for the diamonds , they're not there . Now they must take a trip to George ( who is in jail , of course ) to discover where he has hid the jewels . George doesn't suspect Wanda , but suspects Otto of turning him in . He doesn't tell her where the jewels are . So Wanda meets with George's lawyer , John Cleese , the only man who George would talk to , and the only man who could possibly know where the diamonds are . Wands plays Cleese for information , but soon chaos ensues and the plot takes so many twists and turns it's hard to say what happens without ruining some gags . "" A Fish Called Wanda "" is probably a bit too fondly remembered . I heard so much about this movie and was really expecting a lot . Yes , it's funny , and yes , it has very funny moments , but I really expected more than I got . Writer-star John Cleese does a good job playing a British lawyer , or bannister , or whatever they are called in England . Curtis does a good job playing a smart thief who uses her good looks and charm to lure men into her trap . Michael Palin is great as a stuttering Ken . But the best of the cast is Kevin Kline as Otto . He is a wild guy who is both impulsive and aggressive . A bad mix . One of my favorite scenes is where he comes in to apologize to John Cleese , and finds a robber in Cleese's home , assaults the robber , then realizes it is Cleese himself , and says , "" I'm sorry , I'm sorry , "" then starts saying , "" How was I supposed to know it was you ? I mean , what kind of person robs their own home ? Hey , yeah , what kind of person robs their own home , you idiot ! "" And he starts to kick him . It shows how much of a problem this guy has . Another one of my favorites is just about anytime he and Michael Palin are on screen . Otto's mimicking of Ken ( "" K-k-ken's c-c-c-coming to k-k-k-kill me ! "" ) ranks high as a gut-grabber . But just about any scene with the two men is hilarious . The script is nice , and doesn't go overboard at anytime . But I still think the film is a bit overrated . I laughed , I had fun , but it wasn't one of the most memorable comedies I've ever seen . I've seen much better , to tell you the truth . stars - John Ulmer

Text2: Carol Reed's "" The Third Man "" strikes all the right cords , establishing itself on so many different levels that it almost becomes untouchable . It has an underlying tone of darkness that not only thrills but chills . It grabs the viewer from the start and never lets go . It opens with Anton Karas ' startling zither music and quickly propels the viewer into a world of evil and lies . The tale is familiar to any film lovers : A pulp Western writer named Holly Martin ( Joseph Cotten ) is invited to post-war Vienna by an old friend of his , Harry Lime ( Orson Welles ) . The city has been divided into American , British , French and Russian zones . The city exists as a shattered remnant of the past - haunting and horrifying , dark and mysterious . Upon his arrival , Holly discovers to his horror that his old college pal is dead - hit by a car in the middle of a street . But for Holly , the circumstances don't add up - everyone involved in the accident was related in some way or another to Harry . So Holly searches for clues , much to the chagrin of the British officer Calloway ( Trevor Howard ) , whose name is misused as Callohan by Holly many times throughout the film . ( "" It's ' Calloway , ' Mr . Martin , I'm not Irish . "" ) Holly Martin does begin to stumble upon some vital clues as to the real story behind Lime's death - and finds out more than he bargained for . Lime's old girlfriend is a stage actress . ( "" Always comedy . "" ) She accompanies Holly throughout the film , and we expect an underlying romance to blossom , but yet in the end it does not - one of the many surprises of the film . I suppose it would be a sin for me to give away how Harry Lime reappears , or even give away the fact that he does , for that matter ( though by now I am sure you realize Orson Welles is in this movie and therefore turns out to be alive ) . But for those who have seen the film , we all remember that terrific scene where the cat meows , and suddenly he appears , an evil smirk on his face like a child who has gotten away with the cookie from the jar . And then the ferris wheel scene , and the chase through the sewers that no doubt helped win the film an Oscar for cinematography . These are all some of the most memorable of film scenes . The director of "" The Third Man , "" Carol Reed , stumbled upon the film's musician , Anton Karas , one night in a trashy bar in Vienna . It is no wonder that out of all his candidates he chose Karas - the film's tune is literally the most perfect example of matching harmony between a film and its music I have ever seen ( although "" JAWS "" is up there with it ) . To go into the music is pointless - it must simply be heard in synchronism with the film for you to understand where I am coming from . When I think of film noir , "" D . O . A . "" ( 1949 ) and "" The Third Man "" ( 1949 ) are the first two films that come to mind . Both accomplish what they set out to do , but "" The Third Man "" exceeds even farther than the former - it is haunting and almost poetically vibrant in the way it displays its story and the outcome of its characters . It is a film that will be around for years and years . "" Citizen Kane "" is often thought of as the greatest American motion picture of all time . But if I had to choose between the two , I would most likely choose "" The Third Man . "" It's just my opinion , of course , and many may not agree , but as far as I see , "" The Third Man "" beats "" Citizen Kane "" - for me - on more levels than one . Welles ' "" Citizen Kane "" ( 1941 ) was an artistic film that rarely used close-ups . It would almost stand back from the scenes and let the viewer focus on what he or she wanted to focus on . "" The Third Man "" has many close-ups . I do not take this as a director trying to give the audience what he wants them to see , but rather a director in touch with his feelings and ideas . Director Carol Reed knows just how to evoke characters ' feelings from scenes and close-up shots . The camera tilts at awkward angles more often than not . The more and more paranoid and afraid our hero becomes the more and more intense the close-ups and angles . There is some haunting material in "" The Third Man , "" some material the most novice of filmgoers might not expect . And the music and direction only makes it all the more terrifying and haunting . This is a film that you must witness to believe . .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Maybe it would have been better if they kept to their successful omnibus formula , yet it's unquestionable that the team who made this film was talented . Director Roy Ward Baker damn well knows how to shoot a compelling horror film with titles on his repertoire like ' The Vampire Lovers ' , ' Quartermass and the Pit ' and ' Asylum ' . Then what exactly is the matter with this film ? It has screaming alright ? the main actress gave me a headache with her constant screaming . Catherine Ferngriffen is the young , beautiful wife of a rich landlord . As soon as she's homed in her husband's estate , she's haunted by nightmarish visions and freaky paintings . Catherine is also chased by a chopped off hand and nobody in the mansion dares to explain anything to her . Understandable , since any friendly soul that does tries to inform her dies a tragic death . ' And Now the Screaming Starts ' contains far more boring and tedious sequences than exiting ones , and that's not very good for a horror film . Also , the ' mystery ' is exaggeratedly stressed and annoyingly kept secret far too long . Great expectations are automatically being formed , but the climax regretfully turns out to be yet another ( SPOILER ! SPOILER ! ! ) variant on the pay - for - the - sins - of - your - ancestors curse . The opening credits list Peter Cushing and Herbert Lom first , while it takes a good 50 minutes before either of them has an appearance . Lom is great as the savage and heartless landlord , but his part is too confined to save the plot . There also are a few nice , professional make-up effects but overall few excitement and action . Apart from the grotesque finale , which is pretty gruesome and over the top . What remains is an avoidable supernatural tale , yet with lovely countryside settings and beautiful costumes .

Text2:  Figures in a Landscape  is definitely one of the weirdest and most unclassifiable movies I've encountered lately , and at the same time it's pretty difficult to explain why that is . Some movies are weird because they increasingly overpower the viewer with substantial twists and / or stylistic gimmicks , but still they constantly uphold the impression there's some kind of deeper meaning or hidden structure behind it . The films of David Lynch are like that , for example . Other movies , and "" Figures in a Landscape "" is definitely one of them , are weird because they never at one point feature abrupt story twists and never even seem to want to achieve a deeper meaning . Kind of like the ' what you see is what you get principle ' and don't even bother asking background information . Based on Barry England's novel - that probably only very few people have read - "" Figures in a Landscape "" revolves on two escaped convicts nervously running across a desolate area . Pretty much like the title implies , they are , in fact , simply figures in a landscape . We're never explained where exactly the events take place ( South America ? East Asia ? ) or what crimes the two committed in the first place . They must have been quite serious , however , as MacConnachie and Ansell quickly find themselves besieged by a menacing black helicopter and later also by army patrols on foot . The helicopter plays a devastating mental and physical game with them , as it appears to be omnipresent and in absolutely no hurry to pick them up . This is the type of film where there are no characters to root for . You won't develop any sympathy for the fugitives as they commit some truly vile acts along their way and you can't really support the guys inside the helicopter , neither , as their faces aren't even properly shown . "" Figures in a Landscape "" is a brooding , moody and mildly unsettling film that doesn't always makes sense and doesn't bother to involve the viewer . But , if you manage to put all the unanswered questions aside from you , this also might turn out one extremely enchanting viewing experience . Every shot , every inch of the landscape seems precisely measured and re-considered at least a dozen times before featuring in the film . The choreography is simply wonderful and the filming locations ? apparently Spanish ? are almost continuously breathtaking . The performances of Robert Shaw and Malcolm McDowell couldn't be more apt and Joseph Losey's direction is very surefooted . After seeing only this and the even more unique "" These are the Doomed "" , I'm more than anxious to check out Losey's further repertoire .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Hauer can sense when the creature is nearby as the viewer watches his agony ( not to mention we hear the thudding of heartbeats in the soundtrack ) . Duncan plays Hauer's partner , a young psychologist who is a college grad well studied in the understanding of psychopaths and their natures . The film also has a sub-ploy concerning Cattral , as Hauer's dead partner's wife who came to visit her late husband's grave stand . Hauer and Cattral had a thing at one time , but his alcoholism and decline in mental health ( the obsession in finding his partner's killer ) ended that partnership . Though , we see in their meeting ( Hauer came also to honor his best friend's tomb ) and the fire is rekindled .

After the murders within her fantasies are committed , Lorna awakens bewildered , often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality . If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco , I'd say it's elegant & difficult . By now , you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about , since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream . Franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by Godard early in his career , as far as film-making style , and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience . And , as you read from the reaction of the user comments here . . some like this decision , others find the style labouring , dull , and bewildering . I'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head , but even Franco himself , when quizzed by critics who watched "" Succubus "" , admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it ! Some might say that "" Succubus "" was merely a precursor to his more admired work , "" Venus in Furs "" , considered his masterwork by Franco-faithful , because it also adopts the surreal , dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he / she is experiencing something real or imagined . In a sense , like the protagonist , we are experiencing the same type of confusion . . certainly , "" Succubus "" is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on . And , a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters . "" Succubus "" is also populated by beatnik types and "" poet-speak "" , Corman's film , "" A Bucket of Blood "" poked fun at . My personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between Lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party . . quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually . Great locations and jazz score . . I liked this film myself , although I can understand why it does receive a negative reaction . Loved that one scene at the posh party with Lorna , a wee bit drunk , writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig ( . . equally wasted ) rush her in an embrace of kisses .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: In my opinion , there is more than one type of Woody Allen film . There is the antic lunacy of films like Bananas and Sleeper , the serio-comic "" serious "" film with "" meaning "" , like Annie Hall , Husbands and Wives and Deconstructing Harry and then there are what I think are Woody Allen's "" love notes "" , if you'll bear with the expression , films like The Purple Rose of Cairo , Bullets Over Broadway and Sweet and Lowdown , films as a general rule that are period pieces ( generally the ' 30's or thereabouts ) that are basically mash notes from Allen to something Allen particularly cares about , such as jazz in Sweet and Lowdown ( specifically jazz guitar and Django Reinhardt ) . The score is great , which is typical for a Woody Allen film . Allen does these little films vey well and they are almost always worth watching . Sean Penn plays a self-centered , egotistical creep with talent . I will leave any further interpretations regarding the preceding statement to the Gentle Reader . Why he was nominated for an Oscar escapes me . Samantha Morton , on the other hand , gives a sweet , if almost one-note , performance , which basically sums up the movie : worth the time and effort to watch , but a one-note film . If you like this side of Woody ( and I do ) , this is worth seeing .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

None of the works named stunk , indeed , there are endearing moments and qualities to every ONE of those works , but as far as average audiences were concerned , they were dismal disappointments , for one reason or another . Clifford is generally considered to have fallen into that category . Martin Short portrays a 90 year old priest , and a 10 year old holy terror of a child who will do anything he can ( and what he can do is formidable ) to get to Dinosaur World to fulfill his dream . I found this work amusing .

The execution of this screen play and the filming styles are inspired and simply breathtaking . As the stakes mount in the Bride's game of cat and mouse , the players find they must stop at nothing , in order to survive her rampage of unrelenting revenge .

For Penelope , it's virtually love at first sight , her facial expressions and eyes doing almost all of the talking for her . Evans is an amiable patient , but he has scores to settle , and this sets up the tension of the film . The longer he stays with the family , the more they cut away at his rough edges , providing an anchor in an otherwise lawless West . There are a couple of back stories going on in the film , for one , outlaw Laredo Stevens ( Bruce Cabot ) is a thorn in Evans ' side . He and his gang attempt to rustle a herd of horses , only to be foiled by Evans and his partner Randy McCall ( Lee Dixon ) . Randy is enthralled by the Bible given to Quirt by the Quaker congregation , and takes to reading it in any spare moment . Then there's the territorial marshal Wistful McClintock ( Harry Carey ) , who it seems has made a career out of bringing Evans to justice . His remarks are some of the highlights of the film - "" I'm patient , that's what hangs all you fellas in the end , I'm patient "" . His regard for Evans ' reputation though is almost respectful - "" You know Quirt , I always figured on usin ' a new rope in hangin ' you "" . Evans is respectful of the Quaker family's ways , he hangs his holstered gun outside , never allowing it inside the home . When he takes Penelope on a wagon ride to pick blackberries , he leaves it behind in deference to her wishes . When Quirt shows up in town to call out Laredo Stevens , the Worth family arrives on the scene , and in what could be a fatal mistake , Evans gives up his gun to face Laredo weaponless . It would have been a tragic finale , if not for the vigilant Marshal McClintock . As Evans makes his way home with the Worths , the Marshal picks up Evans ' gun and proclaims to hang it in his office along with a new rope , in memory of the adversary who never was . Released in 1947 by Republic Pictures , "" The Angel and the Badman "" comes some dozen years or so after Wayne's Lone Star films which all followed a similar formula . Although a "" B "" Western , it's got a quality to the filming and story line that make it rise a considerable notch above his mid 1930's films .

Text2:  Charlie Chan at Treasure Island  is at the top of many Chan fan lists as their favorite ; it certainly deserves that distinction . Even when the film gets creepy it's fun , as in the séance scene at the home of Dr . Zodiac . Charlie Chan's friend Paul Essex is an apparent suicide aboard a San Francisco bound plane flight . His suicide note - "" Can't escape Zodiac , Good Bye my Love , Paul "" . Charlie Chan ( Sidney Toler ) is warned not to investigate : "" Do not challenge the supernatural unless you are prepared to visit your ancestors . "" But investigate he does , and as usual we are introduced to a colorful cast of characters and suspects along the way . There's The Great Rhadini ( Cesar Romero ) , who challenges other magicians and psychics , his mind reading assistant Eve Cairo ( Pauline Moore ) , and insurance investigator Salsbury ( Douglas Dumbrille ) . Aiding Charlie on the case are Number # 2 Son Jimmy ( Victor Sen Yung ) and Deputy Chief Kilvaine ( Donald MacBride ) . Watch for a neat scene when Chan returns to the Zodiac home a second time - a black cat crosses his path . The twist to the story comes when we learn that Romero's character Rhadini is also Dr . Zodiac , blackmailing victims with secrets from their past . He even takes a knife to the shoulder during an on stage performance in an attempt to throw suspicion in a different direction . The film borrows from a Bela Lugosi trademark , piercing dark eyes attempting to overcome psychic Eve Cairo's thoughts while under Chan's influence to flush out the killer of Zodiac's Turkish servant . The film is set against the backdrop of the 1939 San Francisco World's Fair , Treasure Island being an attraction , along with the Century of Progress Exhibition . But as in most of the Charlie Chan films , the locale is secondary to the mystery , and this time it's a good one , with clever writing and just enough imagination to make you wonder whether mind reading might actually be real !","{""output"": ""YES""}"

When the beast gets the drop on him , he becomes despondent over his fear , so when it actually gets captured , he lets it go just so he can hunt it again and exact some sort of vengeance for being humbled so badly . This , just as his estranged daughters Leslie and Georgia ( Nancy Kwan and Jennifer Rhodes ) arrive for a visit , with Georgias ' daughter Peggy ( Lesly Fine ) and local tour bus operator Ross ( Ross Hagen ) in tow . This material had some potential , and it does have some atmosphere going for it . That said , I don't think it's particularly well made , well written , or well acted . ( Although Hagen is very amiable and it's a hoot to see Pleasence really go off his rocker here . ) The leopards ' stalking scenes aren't bad , but the actual attack scenes left something to be desired . This is never as scary or as suspenseful as I would have liked ; it's basically watchable , but barely so . Location shooting in Thailand helps , anyway .

Text2: A couple , David ( Luke Wilson ) and Amy ( Kate Beckinsale ) , whose relationship is obviously under severe strain , have car trouble , wouldn't you know it , in the back of the beyond , where they end up staying in one of those motels common to movies where the concept of "" checking in , but not checking out "" applies . The only form of entertainment in their extremely filthy unit consists of snuff films caught on tape ; David catches on fairly quickly that the films were shot in that same room , and from then on the two are fighting for their lives . Although it succumbs to the standard genre pitfall of "" stupid people doing stupid things "" early on in the movie ( I would have tried to leave a lot sooner ) , it's amazing how well this taut , well-crafted thrill ride delivers the goods . It's paced incredibly well , and actually succeeds in delivering not only real suspense , but jump scares that really work . It's a novel twist to have your heroes / victims not be sympathetic from the get go ; it makes their ultimate need to rely on each other in order to survive more compelling . Wilson and Beckinsale are both credible ( I'm very struck by how well Beckinsale can play an American ) , but veteran Frank Whaley steals the show as the motel manager whose geeky demeanor is an all-too-obvious mask for an insidious and evil nature . Filmed in a very dark fashion , and taking place mostly during one night , the film-makers , led by a capable director named Nimrod Antal ( I hope to see much more from him in the future ) are a stylish group of people ; it's simply a well made film from beginning to end . I particularly liked the masks that the killers wear ; they're kind of Michael Myers-like , and are done by a company called Almost Human , who also did the makeup effects .

Text2: What had drawn me to watch Death Defying Acts , is that it's a story with Harry Houdini , arguably the greatest illusionist and escape artist of our time . A few days ago I was browsing through a book which revealed the secrets behind his brand of death defying acts , and really he's a man of science , engineering and most of all , a performer to bring to life the act of fooling an audience into believing his stunts . Sure there's an element of danger , but with proper risk assessment and safeguards , they strip away all the mystique that serves to confound . But contrary to the title , there's nothing really death defying about the movie , as it treaded on safe ground and doesn't dwell any more on the illusions that it has to . In fact , you can count the number of stunts which involve Harry Houdini , and the filmmakers left that for another biographical movie that someone else should pick up on . What we have instead are glimpses into the man's personal life , and Guy Pearce provided quite an intense and charismatic Houdini with personal demons of his own to do battle with , though the story seemed to rein him in from dwelling too much on that aspect , and preferred to have a more romantic tale weaved in . The romanticism of the movie is not with his illusions , but with a single parent who's a psychic of sorts , relying on her street smarts to get her own act going . Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Mary McGarvie , who has to rely on her wits to build credibility for her stage character . Together with daughter and sidekick Benji ( played by Saoirse Ronan of Atonement fame ) , the mother and daughter team tries hard to make a living from their acts , but realize that they're by no means close to Houdini's widespread fame and fortune . However , Houdini himself throws a gauntlet to all psychics far and wide , that whosoever can accurately reveal what his late mother had last said to him , will inherit US$10 , 000 . His purpose it seems is to reveal that the majority of these soothsayers are tricksters in disguise , until of course he meets the luminous Mary , and affairs of the heart throws him off course . Naturally , Mary and Benji find themselves up against the best in the business , but when your back is against the wall , there's nothing much to lose it seems . As mentioned earlier , this movie's more of a character study of the master magician , and explores things like his guilt because of dedication to his craft and performance , as well as his questionable motives in being attracted to the fictional Mary McGarvie . Narrated by the character of Benji , we see things through a child's eyes , and perhaps therein lies the loss of some pathos in the romantic angle of it . On one hand , it isn't your classic romantic story , while on the other , it doesn't seem to want to preach the method , rationale and mindset of Houdini himself . So what emerged is a mixed bag . Beautifully shot , but again falling on the emptiness of its effort in trying to allow the audience to feel for the characters . At least Timothy Spall , who plays Mr Sugarman , Houdini's manager , allowed for some light moments as the guarded and wary person that he is . And credit goes to keeping the ending quite right too .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: Herzog's short film about the doctors that fly all over central Africa to bring medical help to the people living in the bush . We fly with the doctors and they tell us about the history of their service and how they treat their patients . Its a very good , and considering the director almost too straight forward documentary . It has none of the earmarks of what you would think of as a Herzog film and if I had missed the opening credits I would never have guessed who directed it . To be honest the film is very reminiscent of a Mondo movie . Not because its sensational , rather because its African setting in the late 1960's coupled the narration makes it seem ( slightly ) more exploitive then it is ( I wonder if the English narrator did Mondo work ) . What I found interesting was the stories of the culture clashes that occur for the doctors , as say some of the tribesmen refused to climb stairs or a poster designed to warn the people about a fly that causes blindness are not understood by the people its suppose to help .

This is not meant as an insult , as the makers of this film intended for it to be very dumb and in the process the film is also quite entertaining . There are many times I could just use some mindless fun and I am thankful that films like the Bill and Ted films , UHF , TALLADEGA NIGHTS and THE WATERBOY are there when I am in the mood for goofiness . Adam Sandler stars as Bobby Boucher - - a guy so socially inept people assume he is an idiot . His sole desire in life when he film begins is to be a waterboy for a football team - - even though he's in his 30s ! When he shows up at South Central Louisiana State University looking for this job , the coach ( Henry Winkler ) lets him do it - - - provided he doesn't have to pay Boucher ! Oddly , Boucher looks at his job as if it were a science and he takes amazing pride in such a menial and worthless job . In the process , he looks like a total geek and the players make fun of him constantly . Eventually , all the needling reminds him of all the many , many , many times others have made fun of him over the years and he reacts by knocking one of the players off his feet . Not realizing it , Boucher was able to channel his 31 years of rage into tackling . Winkler realizes Boucher's potential and gets him to agree to play football - - even though Boucher's mama ( Kathy Bates ) thinks "" foosball is of the Devil ! "" . This is accomplished by pretending that he's just the team's waterboy . I loved when he came home bruised up after a game and explained that it was because he was beaten up by an escaped gorilla . . . . and she believed it ! ! However , when Mama finally learns the truth , she slips into an unknown illness and Waterboy is unable to bring himself to play in the super-important Bourbon Bowl ! The film abounds with stupid moments - - the sort that make kids laugh and adult often pretend aren't funny . I believe that most sophisticated adults WILL like the film but should probably only watch it when the kids are asleep - - otherwise the children will realize that their parents are capable of laughing at Adam Sandler . Clever writing , lots of silly gags ( such as his run-in with ' Colonel Sanders ' ) and a part that works well for Sandler , this is one of his better films . I also recommend you try watching THE WEDDING SINGER . And , because I care about you , I advise you to avoid LITTLE NICKY like the plague , as its juvenile humor is something only the most seriously brain damaged can appreciate . It's just not funny .

While I would agree that Sean Connery is the best of the Bonds , his last film was simply awful - - with lousy writing and too much self-parody to be taken seriously . Here , Roger Moore steps into the role and was blessed with much better writing and a nice lack of the gadgetry that so hindered the franchise . Over the years , gadgets took precedence over intelligent writing - - here , there is no ' Q ' and the film seems more menacing and realistic . So what are the short-comings ? Well , as I mentioned above , there is a lot of silliness with the fortune telling and voodoo . Also , the Southern sheriff bit with Clifton James ( which was repeated , oddly , in the next film ) , was played for laughs - - disrupting the general flow of the film .

767,"Text1: This extremely hectic and nearly headache-inducing short by the Japanese punk demigod Sogo Ishii is definitely one of the craziest and most experimental art-house movies I ever had the pleasure of seeing on a big screen ( during a special revolving on the director ) . After the two hugely different but already influential long-feature films "" Panic High School "" and "" Crazy Thunder Road "" , Ishii finally made the punk-short he clearly dreamed of making ever since the beginning . "" Shuffle "" is based on comic strip and doesn't really have a story to tell . The camera just very creatively follows a man as he's running out of his apartment and down the streets . He's running from the cops , because he murdered his girlfriend , but he's also running towards the pimp who stole her from him , for vengeance . 30 minutes of playtime only to depict a man running down some streets seems long , but Ishii somehow manages to make it fascinating by presenting a non-stop series of imaginative camera tricks , lighting techniques and unique sound-editing . The visuals are groundbreaking and far ahead of their time . The colors continuously fade out and back in , the camera is put in every possible perspective there is and the music is really loud and stimulating . "" Shuffle "" often looks like an exercise for Ishii's next big project "" Burst City "" and it definitely was a great source of influence for future Asian filmmakers like Takashi Miike and Shinya Tsukamoto . You can't really call it a great film , because there are almost no dialogs or character drawings , but it surely guarantees half a hour of adrenalin-rushing spectacle .

Text2: Despite realized with a large budget , despite featuring eminent names both in front and behind the camera and despite scoring reasonably well at box office , "" Quills "" is quite a popular movie among the fans of primitive and out-of-the ordinary exploitation movies . This selected group of cinema freaks ( myself included ) usually avoids the big blockbusters , but still took the effort to check out "" Quills "" and label it as a successful amalgamation between mainstream film-making and cult . This has everything to do with the legendary character of Marquis de Sade , whose notorious writings were ? and still are ? a rich source of inspiration for underground movie makers . Just think the sleazy classics directed by Jess Franco ( "" Jusine "" and "" Eugenie "" ) or Pier Paolo Pasolini's hugely controversial classic "" Salo , or the 120 days of Sodom "" . These are genuine cult gems and , naturally , the avid fans are interested in a full-feature film dedicated to the life of the Marquis . I don't know how accurate Doug Wright's screenplay really is when it comes to details , but it's generally known that Marquis de Sade indeed spent several years locked away inside a mental asylum and indeed he nearly got executed for spreading literature of perverse nature . Unlike I expected , "" Quills "" doesn't focus on how the Marquis ended up at the Charanton asylum or how he managed to convince the ordinary chambermaid Madeleine to smuggle his sex-laden stories to the outside world for publishing . The film merely revolves on how the Marquis continues to express his perversely wicked imagination even after the hypocritical Dr . Royer-Collard confiscated all of his writing-material . The absolute greatest sequences in "" Quills "" center on how he thinks up new stories and writes them down on sheets , walls and clothes using basic equipment like chicken bones and even his own blood and faeces . Talk about dedication ! The more his opponents realize this man is impossible to censor , the more unendurable his living conditions at the asylum get . Especially when Dr . Royer-Collard's under aged wife runs away with a young and potent architect , clearly influenced by Marquis de Sade's graphic novel "" Justine "" , his stay at Charanton turns into a living hell . "" Quills "" is a fascinating film that surprisingly doesn't hold back on strong sexual content and violence . Listening to Geoffrey Rush's insanely perverted imagination , you often get the impression you're actually watching a sleazy and exploitative 70's gem , but with the masterful set-designs and costumes of a fancy Hollywood film . Speak of the devil ; Rush obviously enjoyed depicting the Marquis and literally his every grimace and monologue is performed with diabolical delight . Michael Caine , in a rather unusual role , is perfect as the ill-tempered ' curer of evil ' , hypocritically hiding himself behind a veil of religion and political protection . Kate Winslet and Joaquin Phoenix are adequate performers but rather miscast in their roles of well-meaning supporters of artistic freedom . And , last but not least , another reason for horror fanatics to check out "" Quills "" is that it features numerous gruesome images of severed heads , attempted rape , cold & uncanny interior shots of a Napoleonic asylum and naughty young girls .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

"" Black Magic "" offers the usual cast of characters / suspects , in this case most of the seance members have an ax to grind with the victim , from cheated business associates to jilted lovers ( which is a mystery in itself , as Bonner did not have the personality or looks when it comes to the romance department ) . Mantan Moreland gains progressively more screen time in this third Monogram installment to the Chan series , and this is his best appearance so far , although the racial comments continue as in past Chan films - "" If spooks bother you , Sergeant will arrest them "" . Another welcome break from the standard Chan formula is the replacement of Number # 1 , 2 or 3 son with daughter Frances - "" Beauty of Chan family also have brains "" . Sadly though , her portrayal is wooden and uncomfortable at times , with repeatedly wasted lines . We've seen it before - the seance , the lights out , the gunshot and the resolution exposed by Charlie . The frozen blood bullet is an interesting twist , but don't even try to understand the ballistics involved . A lot of liberty is taken to make all the pieces fit , nevertheless , prepare to be entertained by "" Black Magic / Meeting at Midnight "" .

Text2: The first time that I saw "" Enemy of the State "" advertised , it looked totally formulaic and idiotic . It appeared to be about someone planting something on Will Smith , so Smith has to take matters into his own hands . I thought : "" Oh , and I bet that they didn't know who they were messing with when they put it in HIS pocket . "" When I saw the movie much later , I was surprised . Now , I will admit that parts of the movie are predictable ( such as the end ) , but the whole thing about surveillance was actually quite interesting , especially with the recent NSA scandal . Therefore , this movie seems better many years after its release than at the time of its release ( just the opposite of what one would expect ) . So , it's not a masterpiece by any stretch , but worth seeing .

770,"Text1: SPOILER ALERT First of all , I would like to point out that I am a huge fan of Roger Ebert . His reviews are well written and enlightening about the movies that they focus on and often a lot of obscure movies that are related to the one in question , but his review of Memento is one of the most ignorant and just flat-out incorrect pieces of film criticism that I have ever read . Sure , there's a hole in the plot . If the last thing that Leonard remembers is his wife dying , then he should not technically remember that he can't form short term memories . Plot hole , yes . But who cares ? ! Anyone ? Anyone ? Me neither . Plot holes plague the Back to the Future series , one of the most entertaining trilogies ever made , left and right . In Part II , Marty McFly leaves 1985 to travel to the year 2015 to prevent his teenage son from robbing a bank and getting thrown in jail and starting that horrible chain reaction that destroys his entire family . In his review of that film , Ebert seems to have overlooked the MASSIVE plot hole that far overshadows the one that he points out in Memento ? if Marty leaves 1985 and travels to 2015 , there is no longer any Marty left in 1985 to grow into the 47-year-old Marty that he finds in 2015 . This little revelation suggests that Ebert is either judging films on varying and unstable criteria , or he has something against someone involved in the making of Memento . Regardless of what Ebert says , Memento is an absolutely brilliant film that engages the viewer and literally brings him or her into the mind of the main character . Ebert naively points out that the reverse plotline of the film has nothing to do with Leonard's condition , which is arguably the most foolish thing that he says in his review . Ebert has made what may be called the idiotic assumption that the reverse plotline represents the way that Leonard lives . I am finding it difficult to determine how he has managed to come to that conclusion without inserting plotlines of his own into the film , such as ones involving time travel or some other such science fiction nonsense . Memento is a dramatic thriller about a man with a severe psychological memory disorder , and the reverse plotline is there to put the audience in Leonard's shoes . He has no idea what happened before what he's doing right now , and neither do we . Are you hearing this , Roger ? I suggest you watch this movie again , because you missed a LOT . ( spoilers ) Another gigantic element of the plot that Ebert seems to have missed ( BOTH times he saw the film ) , is the fact that Leonard's wife was never raped , and never killed . There is a single shot near the end of the film ( I warn again , there are spoilers ahead ! ) that is not more than a few seconds long , that proves that she was never killed ( I suppose rape is still a possibility ) , and also eradicates the plot hole that Ebert pointed out , that Leonard should not be able to remember his ' condition ' if the last thing that he remembers is his wife being killed . The shot that I am talking about is one in which Leonard is laying in bed , and his wife is laying next to him with her head on his shoulder , running her fingers over the tattoo across his chest that says ' John G . raped and murdered my wife . ' Are you hearing THIS , Roger ? One viewing , contrary to what Ebert foolishly suggested in his review , is NOT enough for this film . Memento is one of the few films that not only invites repeat viewings , but requires them . Confusion is not the state to be in here , not by any stretch of the imagination . Repeat viewings will remove you from that state and put you in a state of blissful enlightenment as you realize the astonishing intricacy of this film . The poignant back story about Sammy Jankis and his wife is not only powerful and moving , but relates DIRECTLY to Loenard's condition , which is yet another thing that Ebert has amazingly managed to completely miss . In Ebert's defense ( because I do not intend this review of my own to be a knock against one of my otherwise favorite film critics ) , I can only say that maybe he latched onto some erroneous idea the first time he saw the film that clouded his cinematic vision the second time he saw it , or perhaps he was simply viewing it from the wrong perspective . I invite you all to read his review but also note that there are maybe half a dozen or so things that he says in that review that are simply wrong , and this can be easily seen just by watching this incredible film . Roger , I love your work , and I have all of your books , but in this case , it seems that YOU may be the one with the ? condition ! '

Text2: Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that "" less is more . "" This doesn't apply to the violence , the film is extremely violent from beginning to end , but the details of the botched diamond heist , which the entire film is based on , are conveyed only in the dialogue , except for one scene where Mr . Pink ( Steve Buscemi ) recalls his escape . The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over , and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch . This is not a normal crime film . The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE . When you look at the screen , you're looking at reality . There are no Hollywood actors , there's no make-up to make them look pretty , there's little to no comic relief , and most important of all , there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in , a detrimental trademark of so many action films , as well as virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films . Instead of all of that garbage , Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible , and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery . Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made , the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all , you only see the brutal characters that they portray . It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them , and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film . Make no mistake , Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made , and some scenes are really painful to watch , but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film . The violence is never glorified , nor is the criminal lifestyle . When films are overly violent , they usually get branded as such , but despite the extreme violence , Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions . It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films , and it will not be soon forgotten .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

772,"Text1: Jeff Connor ( Roy Rogers ) and Gabby Chapman ( Gabby Hayes ) find themselves in the middle of a three way competition between a stagecoach line , a railroad company and a third party Sacramento Navigation Co . in this rather well done Republic Film from 1941 . This was still the pre Dale Evans era for Roy , so the female lead duties were handled by Sally Payne as Jo Morrison , part owner of the Morrison-Liddell Stage Company . Roy and Gabby smell a polecat when both the stage line and the railroad wind up at odds with each other , figuring that outlaw Black Bart ( Fred Kohler Jr . ) is behind the attacks on both , while in league with shady businessman Amos Norton ( Pierre Watkin ) . The best lines in the film go to Gabby , hands down , who also shows some fancy hand work twirling his six gun , going by the name of Roarin ' Liza . Roy tries out his singing voice with "" Stars Over the Prairie "" , throwing in a verse penned by villain Black Bart . It was a poetry gimmick that led to Bart's undoing , a clue that the crafty Jeff Connor used to smoke out the bandit who used the alter ego of Jim Trevor . Sally Payne's character , pretty but tomboyish , spent most of the film trying to romance Connor , going back and forth between buckskins and a party dress . Her younger brother Chick ( Billy Lee ) was the one to discover the Trevor / Black Bart connection , putting the good guys in the right direction . Sally teamed up with Roy Rogers in a dozen ' B ' Westerns , virtually all between 1940 and 1942 . Prior to Sally , Roy's female lead in the late 1930's was Lynne Roberts , who also used the name Mary Hart . When you see Roy later in the film navigating his way atop the cars of a moving train , be sure to credit Yakima Canutt for the stunt work . He also appears briefly as a stagecoach driver . "" Nevada City "" has a pretty good mix of action , gunfights , and humor , with Roy and Gabby complementing each other nicely as a good guy tandem . Roy and Sally do hook up at the end of the story , tying up that plot line as well . A similar theme involving a three way competition for a postal route contract would be used some dozen years later in a 1953 Western called "" Iron Mountain Trail "" , starring Rex Allen . It shouldn't come as a surprise that it too was a Republic Picture .

Text2: The plot here is standard enough stuff : small town football hero "" Poke "" Jackson ( an amiable Timothy Bottoms ) arrives back in his home town after a five year stint in prison . The crooked sheriff Duke ( Bo Hopkins , in a standard type of role , but doing a solid job ) may have had something to do with that . He's also claimed Pokes ' girl Mary Lee ( Brit beauty Susan George , doing a creditable Southern accent ) , now taking care of Kevin , the son that Poke sired . What we do know for sure is that Duke is behind the assassination of a congressional hopeful , and Poke is a witness . Duke spends the rest of the picture trying to take good ol ' Poke down . Director / actor Jack Starrett , a specialist in this kind of ' 70's fare , does typically good work . The picture moves at a pretty consistent pace ; it's touching at times ( the relationship between Poke and Mary Lee is nicely handled ) and humorous at others . Best of all is the action-oriented climax , which includes some mighty fine vehicle stunts . A solid supporting cast gives it all they've got : Morgan Woodward as crooked fat cat C . J .

773,"Text1: File this one under one of the better Westerns you probably never heard of . It pits a pair of good bad guys ( Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson ) , against a bad , bad guy in a tale of retribution and revenge that's full of clichés that play out refreshingly well when doled out by Lee Walker ( Nelson ) and Jesse Ray Tarence ( Kristofferson ) . It probably helps if you're a fan of the musicians , as the film offers a couple of well placed numbers to move it along ; Nelson's tune is particularly effective if you listen to the words carefully . The pair are joined by young Chad Willett , portraying the son of Waylon Jennings ' character Tobey , who's murdered in the film's opening scene to set up the story . Holden Bonney ( Sancho Gracia ) seeks vengeance on all three men for a perceived ill toward him ; he's the only one of their former gang who did prison time . All the others opted to join the Confederate Army in exchange for pardon upon completing their service . Failing to break their cohort out of jail , Holden has had years to stew about how to get even . What's not made clear is Holden's alliance with a Mexican colonel ( Simon Andru ) , who he hires to help take out his former partners . It's pretty transparent that the two are not very fond of each other , and it seems a bit overdone for him to need an entire Mexican Army regiment to do a Butch and Sundance on the boys . Waylon Jennings offers the film's narration after his brief appearance , in a diary given to his adopted son Brice by Lee . Brice reads the diary during his ride with the former outlaws , and gains new perspective on their life and the code they live by . One confusing element though , Brice's claim to fame was as "" intecollegiate heavyweight boxing champ "" - in the 1870's ? ? ? You just know he'll come to regret that claim , especially after he falls asleep during his first night watch and the group is robbed . He loses his title rather quickly to Tarence . Brice never learned how to handle a gun , his college training taught him how to be a farmer . So it comes as a surprise when he shoots Holden's gun out of his hand in the final showdown . Backing off , Holden uses a hidden derringer at close range to put down his young opponent . As Holden approaches at arm's length , Brice uses a Bowie knife that Tarence gave him earlier acknowledging his lack of skill with a firearm . As the Mexican soldiers are waved off by their leader , Brice collects his "" business associates "" , and heads into sundown with time to ponder on just who these men are that once rode with his father .

Text2: I've always enjoyed watching this movie , and with my most recent viewing I followed up with the episode of ' Billy The Kid ' from the three disc ' Gunfighters ' DVD collection from Nonfiction Films ( 1998 , listed as ' Gunfighters of the West ' in the IMDb database ) . It was pretty surprising to see how closely the film followed real events in the life of The Kid , born Henry McCarty in New York City's Lower East Side in 1859 . All the business with John Tunstall ( Terence Stamp ) and Alex McSween ( Terry O'Quinn ) is based in fact , although the real name of the Jack Palance character was Jimmy Dolan . He was a real life businessman ( read that town boss of Lincoln County ) who was challenged by Tunstall for rights to government contracts at Fort Stanton in the New Mexico Territory . Dolan headquartered his ' Company ' at an establishment named the House of Murphy , hence the name Lawrence G . Murphy used in the picture . The ensuing Lincoln County Wars , often depicted as a range war , was in fact a mercantile war fought essentially over the right of one faction to make more money than the other . I've often wondered whether the real life Billy would have been as maniacal as the way he was portrayed by Emilio Estevez . I would almost think so , but with the kind of charisma that made him entirely likable as a person to those who knew him well and called him friend . Estevez , along with his brat pack buddies have an engaging chemistry on screen , even if most of it is spent dispatching members of Murphy's thugs . If not for Estevez's pacing of the character , the tone of the film would have been entirely different , as most of the men gunned down in the course of the story were simply murdered to avenge the death of Tunstall . My favorite scene had to do with the gunslinger in the saloon who Billy mocked into a gun-down . I'd consider that one of the fictional elements thrown into the story to highlight just how duplicitous the real life Kid could be . Did you notice how the gang reacted instinctively to back up their leader just in case ? I'm not as familiar with the sequel to "" Young Guns "" as the original . Both were written by John Fusco , so I'd expect that the continuity relative to historical accuracy is similarly maintained . Over forty films have been made about the legend of Billy the Kid , along with the blatantly contrived two season TV Western "" The Tall Man "" from the early 1960's . Your best bet apart from the documentary mentioned earlier , while maintaining an element of entertainment , would be tuning into "" Young Guns "" .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
774,"Text1: This is arguably by far the most accessible film yet made by Claire Denis , indeed it's tempting to think that she was persuaded by the money-men to go at least semi-mainstream at least once in order to fund further indulgences like her very next movie L'Intrus , an academics wet dream . Here she opts for two well-known actors in Vincent Lindon and Valerie Lamercier - whose own third film as writer-director Palais-Royal opens in Paris this month - and wisely leaves them to do what they do best and let her camera linger on them as they do so . Lamercier is rare among French actresses in that she is not a head-turner in the tradition of Manu Beart , Catherine Deneuve , Isabelle Huppert , etc but she does have a very definite subtle beauty and Denis brings this out in lingering shots of her face . Laure ( Lemercier ) has just given up her flat , filled the back of her car with portable possessions prior to moving in with her boyfriend yet inexplicably breaking her journey by attending a dinner party . Perhaps I should have said that On Paper those are her plans because having left her flat she finds herself caught up in one of those French transport strikes that punctuate the City of Light the way pauses punctuate a Pinter play . Traffic is virtually at a standstill and the radio is urging drivers to offer lifts to pedestrians so when Vincent Lindon raps on the window and solicits a ride she agrees . This is the point where the pseudo-intellectuals come into their own and ' read ' all kinds of stuff into it ; her life is at an impasse , she feels mentally or spiritually paralysed unable to move forward , you know the kind of thing , easy to do and about as meaningful as a stryofoam cup . Whatever , she and Lindon experience an unspoken attraction and nothing is surer than that they will wind up in the sack but then it is , technically , her Hen night and who's to say she isn't thinking twice about what , to some people , is a major step . So they have their mayfly moment and we share it with them and then it's over . Just like a movie . It's all about the experience , the heightened glow , the memories . This is memorable and one that can stand re-viewing .

Text2: SPOILERS Multi-layered action thriller involving the targeting of the President of the United States for assassination by this Morocco based terrorist group known as the Mujahideen Brigade . Within the first five minutes of the film we get to see US President Ashton , William Hurt , about to address an overflow crowd at the Spanish city of Salamanca's main square and get shot twice before even making an opening statement . In the pandemonium that follows with a deafening explosion that kills and injures scores of people Spanish undercover-cop Enrique Countearon , Eduardo Noriaga , who was tackled by top secret services man Thomas Barnes , Dennis Quaid , as a suspect in President Ashton's assassination makes his escape . Even though Officer Countearon had every reason to do what he did in trying to protect Salamanca's mayor De Soto , Jose Carlos Rodriguez , from sharing the same fate as President Ashton he in fact ends up a fugitive from the law chased by both secret service men and fellow Salamanca policemen . It's then that the movie "" Vantage Point "" goes into rewind and we see the assassination attempt on President Ashton from some five different perspectives including that of the president himself ! Reconstructing the five or so different vantage points of President Ashton's assassination attempt we can then piece together the course of events that lead to this tragic incident . The attack on President Ashton was obviously an inside job that was planned and rehearsed in advance dozens of times before it was finally put into action . SPOILER ALERT What turned out to be the assassins undoing wasn't that their plan wasn't perfect but a number of unexpected incidents came into play including their own distrust of themselves . This in the end had the assassins turn on each other which exposed their entire operation making it easy from the secret service and local police to do their job by the assassins doing it for them . It takes a while to fully absorb what's going on in the movie with it's constantly moving back and forth in time . By the time all the different viewpoints and angles of Pesident Ashton's assassination has been presented the movie then turns into a Bullitt-like chase sequence . We have secret serviceman Barnes tearing up the whole town in a hair raising car-chase in order to get those who were responsible in the assassination attempt . That chase sequence was by far , compared to the constant rewinding of the film , the best part of "" Vantage Point "" . There's also Forrest Whitaker as American tourist Howard Lewis who unwittingly films , with his camcorder , the assassin . At first trying to cooperated with the secret service in finding who took a pot shot at their boss , President Ashton , Howard ends up being the hero in the film . Not by him catching those responsible for shooting the president but by saving little Anna , Alicia Zapien , who he befriended after she accidentally soiled his shirt with an ice-cream cone she was eating . It was Anna together with Howard who , by getting in their way , put a final end to the assassins devious plans by , believe it or not , bringing the very best human qualities out of them which at the time seemed to be an almost impossible task .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

While the latter talks about the evil of drugs , Millions talks about the root of all evil - Money . Lots of it . To be exact , close to 300 British pounds . This film is about taking and using money that is not yours , the morality behind that issue , and the exploration if sudden wealth can change a person's attitude . It also looks at spending large amounts of money ( and the difficulty thereof ) in a short span of time , as this film is set against a backdrop of the British Pound no longer being legal tender after 7 days , given the British's decision to use the Eurodollar . Damian Cunningham is a young boy who's missing his mother , who just passed away , and whom we don't get to see until the end of the film ( in a very touching scene ) . He has been living in his own imaginary world since , reading about and dreaming about talking to Saints , asking them if they had met or known about his mom in heaven . Many times , we look at this world through the eyes of this innocent boy , especially when the huge sack of money literally fell onto him , and he thinks that it is a gift from God as compensation for taking his mom . And that's when the story picks up . His brother Anthony suggested they keep quiet about the finding - reason being the government will tax most of it away , and while Anthony decides to ham it up , using the money to buy friends and cronies , Damian developed a want to help the poor - from people in the street , to Mormons ( the punching bag for some major gags in the film , and the hypocrisy of it all ) , to Africans in need of food , water and shelter , and absolute strangers , which is of course , dangerous when the "" real owner "" of the bag of money come knocking at the door . Given the dilemma of spending , how do you want to do it ? Invest in real estate ? Foreign Exchange ? ( The savvy Anthony came up with those suggestions , and seeing it on screen is hilarious ) . Save it in a bank ? And given your want to help others , how do you do so without endangering yourself , which Damian However , when you realise that the money is not Godsent , but robbed while en route to the incinerator ( one of the many interesting scenes in this film is the heist ) , what do you do next ? Do you continue spending it ? Or give it up ? Do you spend the money as a form of compensation for your house getting ransacked by burglars looking for the loot ? Damian Cunningham is played by Alexander Etel , and you can't help think he's the British's answer to McCauley Culkin at his age . He brings forth pure innocence as Damian , and is absolutely hilarious in his dealings with his imaginary Saints ( complete with halos ) . And the saints go marching on - the highlight of which is St Peter . Listen carefully to the dialogue , as he makes subtle digs into parables and the truth behind a certain miracle - I cracked up at that one . This film isn't complete without the complementary baddie and the uptight community policeman , and also gives the term social engineering a whole new perspective ( even practised by the young ! ) . With Danny Boyle's stylistic editing and beautiful shots of transitions and imaginary situations to complement the social commentary , this could probably be in contention as one of the best films of 2005 .

Text2: This was a very good series , based on the memoirs of an employee at the White House from the Taft Administration through President Eisenhower's . It's obvious too that besides the book by Lillian Rogers Parks , there are also bits from other White House books that are frequently used by historians ( Leslie Nielson plays White House usher Ike Hoover , who wrote an important volume that is frequently used as a source book ) . Leslie Uggams plays Lillian , and the film begins with Lillian's mother Maggie ( Olivia Cole ) starting there in 1911 when William and Nellie Taft are in the White House ( or as the unhappy Taft called it , "" the great White Jail "" ) . Maggie's daughter Lillian eventually overcomes a physical disability to become a useful member of the staff . But the most interesting thing in the series was the glimpse into the eight first families who inhabited the building from 1909 to 1961 . Interestingly the families preceding and following the framing administrations ( Theodore Roosevelt's and John Kennedy's ) are better known to most people than some of those in the eight ( the Tafts , Hardings , Coolidges , and Hoovers are not all that well known today - although Warren Harding's scandal filled administration is recalled to some extent ) . Each administration and the way they handled the White House is different . Taft ( Victor Buono , in a rare nice-guy role ) is concerned with the health of wife Nellie ( Julie Harris ) who had a stroke and had to learn how to speak again . He is also upset at how his old friend Teddy Roosevelt has turned against him ( in one moment he shows how a reconciliation is impossible , as he is depending on Major Archibald Butt to bring Teddy and him back together - and Butt's returning from Europe on the Titanic ) . Wilson ( Robert Vaughan ) has two wives , and the first one ( Ellen - Kim Hunter ) was better liked than the second ( Edith - Claire Bloom ) . Later it is Wilson's health collapse in the fight for the League of Nations that is followed , with Edith taking over his office quietly . Warren and Florence Harding ( George Kennedy and Celeste Holms ) are stuck with a dimwitted husband ( and a corrupt one ) learning that his administration has more holes in it than a swiss cheese . His infidelities are revealed ( before Kennedy and Clinton Harding was our most priapic President ) . Also shown is Mrs . Harding playing Warren's favorite song ( Carrie Jacob Bond's "" The End of a Perfect Day . "" ) on the piano . But George Kennedy and the script writer has one moment giving some dignity to our 29th President . During the 1920 campaign a nasty smear was thrown at Harding based on rumors that his family was not originally white but African - American ( see Francis Russell's THE SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE for an account of this ) . Maggie sees a furious Harding ripping up a "" book "" about his ancestry by one "" Professor "" William Estabrook Chancellor that the Justice Department confiscated . Harding sees Maggie , turns to her , and heartily apologizes for the racist piece of garbage directed at all African-Americans . After he leaves , Maggie sees the book and tells another servant to let the book burn . Ed Flanders shows Coolidge as a businesslike , honest man - a welcome change in terms of abilities to Harding , who is in love with his wife Grace ( Lee Grant ) , and broken - hearted about the death of his younger son Calvin from blood poisoning in a freak accident . Flanders has a great moment telling off ( in ironic manner ) Cloris Leachman as the snooty head of the staff ( leading to her resignation ) . The Hoovers ( Larry Gates and Jan Sterling ) are done too quickly , and one gets the impression they were too aloof from the staff . F . D . R . ( John Anderson ) and Eleanor ( Eileen Heckart ) are shown to be sympathetic to the minority groups due to the President's physical condition . The Trumans ( Harry Morgan and Estelle Parsons ) show that President's feistiness ( and Bess's love of mystery novels ) . And then President and Mrs . Eisenhower ( Andrew Duggan and Barbra Barrie ) raps things up as we reach fairly modern times . It was a welcome view of Presidential private lives rarely done before or since on television ( except for individual Presidents or events in their administrations ) . It has not been revived on television since 1979 , but now is on video and well worth catching .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
778,"Text1:  Meet the Fockers  had a lot of potential but I think its downfall is that it never really goes anywhere . Clocking in at an hour and fifty-five minutes , it is not only longer than its predecessor , but repeats itself too often . In typical Jay Roach style , the director once again basically remakes his original film ( also see the first "" Austin Powers "" sequel ) through eerily similar scenes - - for example the football game in "" Fockers "" is a clear re-do of the water volleyball game in "" Parents , "" ending yet again with someone being injured - - but the film still manages to create just enough new gags to make it worthwhile . This is a generally amiable picture worthy of a night's entertainment . It is not , however , anywhere near as memorable as the first film - - which not only surprised me , but to this day lingers in my memory . ( I still haven't forgotten the dinner sequence with the cat and the mother's ashes . That was brief comedic genius . ) "" Meet the Fockers "" is just a bit too obvious . It's a sequel made for money . Its cast is obviously having a great time - - Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are chewing up the scenery - - but it's far from a respectable and intelligent sequel . ( Then again , who expected it to be ? ) Bottom line is : A fun movie , just not great . My biggest disappointment in "" Fockers "" is the transformation of De Niro's character , Jack Byrnes . In the original , Jack was a very strict disciplinarian , ex-CIA man . In "" Fockers "" De Niro seems to turn his original portrayal into a parody of itself - - Jack was believable in the original , to some degree , and here he is just a bit too broad to find convincing . Although the opening Democrat / Republican comparison between Hoffman's character Bernie ( liberal Jewish ) and Jack ( uptight conservative ) is pretty amusing , especially nowadays , it goes on a bit too long afterwards . At an hour and a half , we don't need another reminder than Hoffman is a liberal and De Niro's character is not . During this , Jack generally acts like a real jerk , and not only devolves past what he was in the first film , but becomes WORSE - he once again disbelieves Greg ( Ben Stiller ) , and it's just sort of tiring because we've already been through this stuff in the first film . Also , perhaps it is just me , but I found De Niro a great deal less likable than he was in the first film . In that , there was a certain element of understanding attached to his actions - - in "" Fockers "" he really does just come across as a mean , sarcastic guy and although De Niro is still very funny , he's nowhere near as funny as he was in "" Parents , "" which built its laughs on absurdity in the face of realism , and not vice versa . "" Fockers "" is a pleasant sequel that delivers enough entertainment for a Friday or Saturday night viewing . Hoffman in particular is an excellent addition to the series and not only has fun in his role , but delivers the most laughs . And his chemistry with De Niro is , once again , very funny . ( Even more so than "" Wag the Dog . "" ) But in the end , I thought to myself , "" Haven't I seen something like this already ? "" And I realized a "" Meet the Little Focker "" better pull something new out of its hat or it's going to become a pretty tiresome ordeal . They should stop now , or come up with some new jokes - - the culture clash jokes can only remain funny so long . . . . Overall rating :

Text2: This Hal Roach comedy short , Jubilo , Jr . , is the twenty-ninth entry in the "" Our Gang / Little Rascals "" series . In this one , the title character walks through a field and sees three tramps singing "" That Old Gang of Mine "" . As he sits with them , he reminisces about his boyhood days when his parents were poor . On his mother's birthday , the father refuses to buy her something since he felt he spent too much on Christmas . So Jubilo resolves to get a job that paid enough for $3 . 00 for a hat he sees through a store window . His first offer is to dig a hole for a dollar but the man who requested it was an asylum escapee . His friends , who had previously been turned down for baseball , offer to pay for covering the hole back up . Next , Jubilo hopes to get paid for carrying cement but , after the man refuses , he ends up dropping it in the muddy water with the rest of the gangs ' feet now stuck with the cement on the way home ! Finally , he decides to hold a circus with Joe posing as a strongman and Jackie posing as a Chinese juggler with balls attached to his head from strings . The profits only reached $2 . 70 so Jubilo reaches to the coin hidden on the refrigerator top for the rest of the balance . On the way home after the parents looked for the missing coin , the father spanks him before everything is explained and all is forgiven . And while the mother knows the hat is a bit fancy , she wears it to church the following Sunday . As Jubilo finishes his story , he's called back by director Charley Chase for the next take . Noticing the flower on his coat for his mother's birthday , Chase says , "" You'll have to take that off , Mr . Rogers . "" Will Rogers obliges then , with the take done , his mother arrives in a limousine and shows off that same hat she got from him all those years ago as they laugh and then Will introduces his crew to her after one last look at his old gang as we fade . . . While Leonard Maltin and Richard W . Bann were a bit confused by the way this story turned out in their definitive book about Hal Roach's Rascals , I was willing to take it as the way Will's ( fictional ) life was in the context of the short . Certainly , Mickey Daniels is excellent as the title character as a young man . Loved the way Mary , in flirting with Mickey , suddenly does a "" pshaw "" every time he ditches her . And some of the scenes I mentioned in the synopsis were quite funny in this very sentimental short . So on that note , I highly recommend Jubilo , Jr . P . S . The grocer that Jubilo ( Mickey Daniels ) offered to work for was his father , Richard . And , once again , kudos to the YouTube poster who added the music of the "" Little Rascals "" composer , LeRoy Shield , to this short .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
779,"Text1: - Despite it's grand name , Halls of Montezuma is a small war film . What I mean is that the movie focuses more on a small group of men and their fears and problems than it does on a grand plan for Allied victory . It's a very personal movie . We get to see these men up-close and we begin to develop feelings for them . I wouldn't doubt that this is one of the first films to show a U . S . Lieutenant so battle scarred that he resorts to using pain killers just to function . Unlike other war films of this era , not all of these men are going to make it to the end . War is like that . It doesn't pick and chose people to live because we like them . So in that regard , it's also more realistic than some other war movies made in the 50s . - To succeed as a small , personal war movie as I've described , the cast has to be able to act . This cast does not disappoint . Richard Widmark , Jack Webb , and Karl Malden are all excellent in their respective roles . I was especially impressed with Webb who has an acting style that can grate on the nerves . He's more subdued here and it works . But as good as these three are , Jack Palance is the highlight of the movie for me . He was undoubtedly the most believable . I could really picture him doing the things in real life that were called for in the script . - I have no difficulty recommending Halls of Montezuma to fans of war films . It's a very welcome addition to my DVD collection .

Text2: - Every once in a great while , you stumble upon a movie that you immediately know is a masterpiece . I had read what other people had written about Audition , but didn't really believe all the hype . Surely it couldn't be as good as people claimed . After seeing Audition for the first time , I simply cannot get the film out of my mind . I doubt I can come up with enough glowing adjectives to describe the movie - disturbing , fascinating , brutal , engrossing , etc . It is quite simply on of the best movies I've ever seen . Fortunately , I knew very little about Audition before I watched . The final 30 or so minutes blew me away . I'm not going to go into detail as this would ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it . Just be prepared for one of the most shocking endings you'll ever likely see . - The plot starts out as something right out of a Hollywood romantic-comedy . A middle-aged man wants to find a new wife . A producer friend of his sets up a series of bogus movie auditions as a way of meeting women . Does it sound enough like typical Hollywood tripe ? The man meets the woman of his dreams . Or is she ? What dark secrets does she hide ? Watch and be amazed . - The acting is first rate . The two leads , Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina , are both excellently cast . Ishibashi comes across as a sympathetic figure who simply wants a companion . Shiina's performance is excellent as the seemingly demure woman with a hidden secret . - Takashi Miike is certainly a director that can be mentioned with the greats of the genre . The images he presents may be difficult to watch , but they aren't easily forgotten . Cinematography , editing , lighting , and the use of dream sequences are all first rate . Since I watched Audition , I've read numerous complaints about how slow the first part of the movie is . While it may seem slow to those more accustomed to Hollywood films where somebody is killed or something is blown-up every five minutes , the slow pace is absolutely necessary to increase the shock value of the end . Miike knew what he was doing . - There are any number of ways to interpret the film . I'm sure that with subsequent viewings , I'll look at the events the movie presents in a different light . There's a lot here to take in during one viewing . I'm almost positive that I'll change the rating of Audition to a after a second viewing .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
780,"Text1: Rosalind Wiseman wrote the novel that Tina Fey adapted for the screen . The result , "" Mean Girls "" is a statement about what it's like to be a student going through high school today . In fact , it presents an ugly side about how school , a place for lasting friendships , camaraderie , and just a place for learning is everything but that , according to what one witnesses . In fact , in order to navigate its cliques and groups , one needs a route map in order not to offend anyone . "" Mean Girls "" is directed by Mark Waters , who gives it a light touch . At the center of the story we find Cady , a newly arrived girl who has lived in Africa and has been taught by her parents . Since they are back in the country , they enroll their daughter so she can have the experience of mixing with her peers . Cady , who is a sweet and naive girl unexposed to the real world , finds friendship with a pair of unpopular students , Janis Ian and Damian . Cady is guided through the ropes by her new friends who suggest to her to penetrate the world of the "" Plastic "" trio who are the local fashionistas in their school . These young women live to dress for school ; instead of studying , the trio has their own set of rules , which totally confuses Cady , who adapts , but she has no feeling for her new acquired friends . Cady makes the mistake of liking one of the Plastics former boyfriend , the hunky Aaron . When she confesses it to Gretchen , this one tells her that is a no-no according to an unknown code of conduct because Aaron is Regina's former boyfriend , and she is to stay away from him . Cady excels in math , but she decides to play dumb in order to have Aaron like her . That develops into more than friendship until Regina intervenes . "" Mean Girls "" will be loved by teen age girls , the audience for which the film is targeted . Lindsay Lohan is immensely appealing as the newly arrived Cady . Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert are Regina and Gretchen , respectively . Tina Fey plays one of the teachers in the school who is wrongly accused of being involved in drugs . The film is fun to watch thanks to the young and talented cast in it .

Text2: It is probably because you only do what the title of the game suggests , tomb raiding that still makes this game of the series one of the best . Later you would do missions not involving tombs . . . where you would raid military bases and buildings . However , Laura Croft always seems most at home in an underground temple searching for treasure and clues to disable deadly traps and unlock doors . Which is basically all you do here . Laura is hired to find pieces of a device by a mysterious woman and she goes to different tombs in order to find them . There are usually some animals to kill and even a T-rex to fight . For the most part you are not killing people in this particular adventure . Though there are a couple of people in this one to fight . The ending is a bit over the top , however , this does not detract from the overall fun to be had in this game . The physics and controls are rather easy to get used to , and no need to worry about ammo as your default weapons never run out .

782,"Text1: George Ade ( 1866-1944 ) is now almost entirely forgotten , although his name still turns up in crossword puzzles . In the first two decades of the twentieth century , his humour pieces and plays were phenomenally popular in America . Most of his work has badly dated : for example , his 1902 musical comedy ' The Sultan of Sulu ' was a satire on America's colonisation of the Philippines . . . hardly a red-hot topic for modern audiences . Ade's best-known and most popular works were his ' Fables in Modern Slang ' : these were moralistic tales recounted in a jazzy slang style that was distinctively Ade's own . As with Damon Runyon , Ade's humour and his characters are very much of his time and place . Ade was a lifelong resident of Indiana , and his fables tend to be filled with Hoosier types who have long since passed from the scene . Just as no real person ever spoke like a Damon Runyon character , nobody ever talked like one of George Ade's Hoosiers . The Essanay movie studio in Chicago did an extremely low-budget series of short films , dramatising Ade's fables . Despite the huge sales figures for Ade's story collections , I'm surprised that these movies were made . Most of the humour in Ade's fables derives from his slangy narrative voice and dialogue ; as these are silent films , those advantages were lost . Indeed , Essanay's series of George Ade shorts appear not to have done well even during Ade's heyday , and - - unlike other Essanay films of this period , starring Chaplin , Ben Turpin , Bronco Billy Anderson , and other marquee names - - they were never re-released . ' The Fable of the Good People Who Rallied to the Support of the Church ' is apparently a typical offering from this series . We see a small rural church , with its preacher ( wearing a dog-collar ) and several members of ' the flock ' ( as an intertitle cries them ) . They decide to hold a church social to raise money for the church's roof fund . ( The funniest gag in this film is a shot of the dilapidated roof . ) Everybody gets to work , making preparations for the social . The preacher is eager to keep this on a profit-making basis , so he carefully marks out the expenses on a large slateboard . When the women make baked goods for the social , the cost of the ingredients is carefully totted up on the board . A man makes some Japanese lanterns ; his materials and labour are also added to the board . Wear and tear on clothing is calculated . Some children gorge themselves on the sweets , and a doctor must be summoned to treat them : his bill is factored into the toll . After all that work , the preacher adds up the expenses , then adds up the profits . I expected the end result to be a deficit , but it actually showed a profit : a grand profit of $6 . 80 . . . a very healthy sum , as it was more than a week's wages for many Americans when this film was made . A title card shows us the payoff : ' Anything to avoid dropping it in the basket . ' I laughed at this , but the payoff wasn't worth the set-up . Indeed , the same could be said about many of George Ade's fables . More for its nostalgic depiction of rural America circa 1910 than for any other reason , I'll rate this short film .

Text2: ' The Honeymooners ' was one of the greatest shows in the history of television . Not only was it consistently hilarious , but the Kramdens and the Nortons were well-defined believable characters we could actually care about . More than once , I've genuinely empathised with Ralph Kramden's frustration as yet another of his get-rich schemes fails . "" The Honeymooners Second Honeymoon "" ( wot , no apostrophe ? ) isn't very good , but the mere fact that it was made at all is noteworthy . We're back in the Kramdens ' familiar walk-up apartment in Bensonhurst ( an amazing reconstruction of the original set , this time in colour ) , and it's depressing to see that the Kramdens STILL don't have a telephone nor a television . Ralph , getting on in years , is still driving a bus . Ed Norton is still working in the sewer , although Art Carney's girth has reached the point where he can barely fit through a manhole . Audrey Meadows was NOT the original Alice Kramden ( that would be actress Pert Kelton ) , but she's the one whom Honeymooners fans remember , thanks to those ' famous 39 ' episodes which have been in constant syndication since their original broadcast . Here , she returns to her role . Alice's mother is staying with the Kramdens for a few days , so of course Ralph ( who hates the old bat's guts ) is in a foul mood . Also , Ralph has to sleep in the kitchen so that Alice and her mother can share the bedroom . Due to some incredibly contrived circumstances , Ralph thinks that Alice is pregnant ! This could have been the premise for a classic ' Honeymooners ' episode back in 1956 , but twenty years on - - with Gleason and Meadows both well past middle age - - it somehow doesn't feel the same . And too many of the jokes here are painfully obvious . Contemplating the arrival of his child , Ralph tells Ed Norton : ' I want you to be the godfather . ' So , of course that's Art Carney's cue to hum a few bars of guess-which movie's theme tune , followed by a bad Marlon Brando imitation . Sheesh ! SPOILERS COMING . At the end of the episode , Ralph of course learns that Alice isn't pregnant after all . However , in some amazingly euphemistic dialogue , she informs him that it's still biologically feasible for her to get pregnant . ( What sort of marriage have they got , if he needs to be told this ? ) Gleason's face lights up as he loosens his necktie and he ushers Meadows towards the Kramdens ' offstage bedroom . "" Let's go-h-h-h ! ! ! ! "" he tells her . ( I was hoping he'd say "" And awaaaaay we go ! "" ) Just then the bedroom door opens , and out comes Alice's mother : her hair in curlers , her face covered in cleansing cream . Ralph's romantic urges are killed right there . The pleasure we get from seeing the Kramdens and the Nortons one more time is mingled with the very depressing fact that they still haven't moved up in the world . ' Honeymooners ' purists may wonder why this special features Jane Kean ( the second actress to play Trixie Norton ) rather than Joyce Randolph ( the original Trixie ) . Wonder no more . In 1976 , Randolph was happily married to millionaire Richard Charles ( who disapproved of her acting career ) , and she was not circulating in showbiz . Kean , a working actress who had already played Trixie several times , happened to be present at a dinner with Gleason and his long-time producer Jack Philbin when Philbin announced to the press that Gleason would be reviving his classic Honeymooners characters . To milk the moment for maximum effect , Philbin also told the reporters that Kean would be back in ' her role ' as Trixie Norton . Joyce Randolph was never offered the part ; she admitted afterward that she felt insulted by this . My former sister-in-law informs me that when ' The Honeymooners Second Honeymoon ' was aired in New York City on a network station , the local channel which normally aired Honeymooners reruns in syndication hired Joyce Randolph to host a special marathon of Honeymooners episodes , apparently hoping that viewers would tune in to see the original Trixie in old episodes rather than the original Ralph , Alice and Ed Norton in a NEW story . Nice try , Trixie . I'll rate this Honeymooners special , mostly for old times ' sake .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

There are a lot of interesting twists , and this really messes with your head . The very idea of the film is intriguing , and rather original . There are of course those few scenes that were badly acted or filmed . Pretty much the entire film is very well-cut . The humor is a remarkable high point in the movie ; Chad Peter definitely has a talent for making the humor come very naturally , and not seem forced at any point in the movie ; this was also the case for the first film of this trilogy , Sex .

Text2: I haven't seen too many Oliver Stone pictures ; JFK , Scarface ( which he wrote , not directed ) , and this one . I don't know too much about his directorial style , but if any of his other films are like this one , I'll have to watch more of them . The visual style is amazing . The whole film has sort of a psychedelic visual style , and utilizes constant cuts and constant change in color scheme , often changing between powerful green , blue , red and even black / white . Of course , none of this is random . It's there to project symbolism and keep the mood intense and constantly evolving , and , believe me , it works perfectly . With many references to popular media ( television , mainly ) , demons and the desensitizing effect of television . The effect of half of the imagery being seen through a television screen or hallucinated is amazing . The film is experimental and psychological . As Stone puts it in the documentary , it's a film about two people breaking the rules , so it's only fitting that the film-makers are also breaking the rules . It's chaotic and wild , insane and mentally exhausting . It's a film about pain , violence and giving in to cravings and desires . But it in no way romanticizes the aforementioned three points . Quite the opposite . I believe someone once told me that the film makes killing and violence look appealing . I can't even explain how wrong that is . This truly is an amazing film . If you can sit through this , and you ( honestly ) think of yourself as perceptive and intelligent , you have to see this movie . It's not just recommended or a good idea to watch , it's mandatory for anyone that ' get ' it . The plot is great and well-paced . It's never boring . The acting is great . The characters are well-written , credible and so easy to understand and sympathize with that many will hate the film for it . The whole film is amazing on so many levels .

784,"Text1: This was a tough movie to follow because the sound was so poor . It had the feel of a 1950's ' B ' Western making it hard to imagine it was made as late as 1963 . That would explain Jock Mahoney's aged appearance since his 1958 TV series "" Yancy Derringer "" , flourishes of which we see in the character of Don Michael O'Casey . Here he shows some of that Yancy charisma with the ladies , along with the stunt riding skills that made him a hit as Range Rider in the early Fifties . Set in 1842 California , the story revolves around the question of that territory's statehood . Don Francisco Hernandez ( Michael Pate ) has allied himself with General Miguel Torena against that prospect in the hopes of becoming it's first Mexican governor . His romantic ambitions call for a marriage to a woman who doesn't love him , Marianna De La Rosa ( Susan Seaforth ) , who in turn finds she has feelings for the handsome renegade Don Mike . There's also a woman in the middle , Carlotta Torres , who does love Francisco , but realizes that he's an evil and ambitious man . Though the viewer finds himself siding with the cause of ' Viva Hernandez ' , it's a tenuous position since the film builds little in the way of sympathy for one side or the other . Don Francisco's hopes for power are crushed when the General confesses that he's on the outs with his superiors in Mexico City , and when Irish Mexican O'Casey defeats him in a sword duel , he knows enough to call it quits . Until he makes a run for it , and is gunned down by a Hernandez loyalist . Oh yeah , Don Francisco was Michael O'Casey's uncle , but it's not that important . There's really little to recommend this film other than an offbeat treat for fans of Jacques / Jack / Jock O'Mahoney . Though as mentioned earlier , you'll be watching an older Yancy putting his spell on the ladies as he finds a way to outwit the bad guys .

Text2: I haven't seen Short Circuit for some time now , but it is such a huge milestone in my childhood that I have to say something about it . Maturer audiences will have a hard time overlooking some of the childish nuances of the movie , but it is such a fun and entertaining family film that all of those things can be easily forgiven . It reminds me of other wonderful family films like Flight of the Navigator and The Goonies , that I used to watch over and over when I was a kid . I feel like I've lost something when I can't think of a single movie now that I love so much that I will watch it a few times a week . Maybe I just am more aware of the time involved in watching the same movie over and over today than I used to be . Johnny 5 is a robot designed for military use until one day it's struck by lightning and , apparently , comes to life . This is a pretty tired formula , something man-made suddenly displaying life-like qualities and wanting to be recognized as a real boy , but it's accompanied by some clever messages about the advancement of technology , particularly technology designed to replace humans , which has always been seen as a bit of a dangerous idea , criticized brilliantly by everyone from Charlie Chaplin to James Cameron . Johnny 5's adventures involve his efforts to avoid capture by the people who made him ( "" NOVA ! No ! ! "" ) , while at the same time trying to prove to the world that he's a living entity now . They could not make a movie like this today . Sadly , CGI has forever replaced the need to create a physical robot like the one that plays Johnny 5 in this movie , so any Short Circuit that was made today would just be some soul-less digital effect cavorting across the screen , instantly forgettable . But here , he's really there , and he's heavy and clumsy and metallic , but so memorable as a movie character that I've recently read that the actual robot prop was sold for something like $500 , 000 . Now THAT is a fan ! Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy have a cute chemistry on screen that is satisfactorily simple . They are both cookie-cutter caricatures , Sheedy the lonely Stephanie , who drives an ice-cream truck for a living , and Guttenberg plays a scientist named Newton , who works for the evil NOVA but who only needs a cute ice-cream lady and a charming robot to change his evil ways . Sound like fun ? No ? Well , it is , trust me . The film has definitely dated , but I'll take special effects that look dated 20 years later over expensive CGI that never looked real in the first place any day . A lot of films claim to be fun for all ages , but Short Circuit is one of the few that really is . It's too bad that movies like this seem to be gone forever now ? .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: The first time I saw "" Fight Club "" I despised it . I found its message stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films including "" The Matrix "" ( which is not quite as realistic as "" Fight Club "" ) . I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it was a bit better and not quite as horrible , but still didn't enjoy it much . However I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb ( it's now # 41 ) . Well I'm happy to report that I found "" Fight Club "" utterly brilliant on third viewing . Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on DVD and it just gets better each time . Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time : Tyler Durden ( whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of "" Taxi Driver "" - according to something I read the first name is harsh , the last name simple and soft ) . Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator , "" Jack , "" whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed . ( Many people don't seem to notice this . ) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep analysis because so many other people have done it so well . Suffice to say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and David Fincher's direction wonderful . It is a brutal and weird film and sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so many critics bagged on it for being "" a laborious dog "" on its initial release . The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that they include critics ' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but childish , and I can understand why some might view "" Fight Club "" as a very childish , contradictory film . ( After all , I used to think the same thing . ) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws . I think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary . Norton embodies the Bored Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly . Fincher is great behind the camera . And the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed , but then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start now . Overall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its message was missed by a lot of people ( myself included ) back in 1999 . In a year of some really good movies "" Fight Club "" was probably the best and is one of my all-time favorite films . It's easy to see how this might be considered the next "" Taxi Driver "" thirty years from now .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
786,"Text1: The Haunting is a masterpiece of horror cinema , it's one of those ghost stories that go on forever because of it's originality and taste . My sister is absolutely in love with this movie , I hadn't seen it in a while , so her and I watched it together the other day and I have to say that surprisingly it still sends chills down my spine when I watch it . The remake was just horrible , it was over done and in some ways just plain annoying . But that's why I would recommend sticking to the original , the classic just never dies . Hill House hasn't exactly had a clean history of former owners , murders and suicides , people screaming to get out , no one wishes to stay there , but for Dr . Markway , he would like to see what it's about . He invites 3 individuals who all have had some sort of supernatural experiences : Theo , Luke , and Elenore . They all together must find a way to survive a night in Hill House when things start going horribly wrong and attack Elenore . The Haunting is a great horror story that has true originality and is perfectly made , I don't see how this movie could have been made better . I give such credit to Robert Wise since this movie is still talked about to this day . If you want a true horror masterpiece , I would definitely recommend this movie to you , watch it in the dark , you'll get the true effect of the movie . Not to mention a good scare .

Text2:  Dangerous Liaisons  is this incredible movie that is so under rated . It's the battle of the sexes and this book was written over 200 years ago ! I love to know that there was this same problem that we still have to this day . That's why enjoyed "" Dangerous Liaisons "" so much because it proves that we have so many differences from the opposite sexes . Men are usually expected to have sex and with a few clever words destroy women's reputations in minutes , while women have to be careful of sleeping with whom , because it's considered shameful . Glenn Close plays Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil , a proper lady with a secretive double life of sex and wishing to destroy a girl's reputation for revenge on her ex for dumping her for this young lady . She also makes a bet with her closest friend , Vicomte Sébastien de Valmont played by John Malkovich , that he could not bed a lady of such high stature and morals , in return if he succeeds , he will finally have the conquest he's been dreaming of , bedding Marquise Isabelle . I don't care what people say , this was Glenn's best performance and she was so brilliant . Her speech of "" Dominate your sex and avenge my own "" was perfect and as a woman I rooted for her in the story . She is a tragic figure that was over looked by many as just another slut . Glenn had my sympathy and I agreed with a lot of her dialog . John as Valmont was absolutely perfect , he's not that sexy looking but has such charm and charisma on the screen you believe him as a lady's man . "" It's beyond my control "" , he repeats this several times throughout the film and it becomes more darker each and every time he says it to Michelle's character . He does the Marquise a favor of bedding young Cecile to help the Marquise's plan of revenge and does such a good job . It was almost too easy for him , but he has a more difficult task of bedding Madame Marie de Tourvel who is married and has very high morals and standards of God and love . He falls in love with her in the process of getting to know her and is so believable , you can see how it breaks his heart to break her's . But he feels he must stand by his reputation and your own heart goes out to him despite his cruel manors as a "" man "" . Michelle Pfeiffer as Marie de Tourvel is so beautiful and elegant and is the only one who knows of Valmont's true side . But she cannot help but fall for his charm and love for her , when she talks to his aunt , this is one of the most true speeches ever in cinema that all women can relate too "" I'm sorry to say this but those who are most worthy of love are never made happy by it . Do you still think men love the way we do ? No . . . men enjoy the happiness they feel . We can only enjoy the happiness we give . They are not capable of devoting themselves exclusively to one person . So to hope to be made happy by love is a certain cause of grief . "" That is so incredibly and painfully true that Marie knows better but can't help but give herself to Valmont . Swoosie Kurtz , Uma Thurman , and Mildred Natwick are all so exceptional and amazing as well in the film . They truly bring the story to life and keep it going with their dialog and actions . Keanu ? Shudder , his acting is like . . . how do I put this delicately ? I think it's . . . wood . : ) Otherwise , trust me this is one of the best movies of all time . This deserves higher than a 7 . 6 and should be in the top 250 . But it's beyond my control . :","{""output"": ""YES""}"
787,"Text1: Interesting film revolving around racism , resulting prejudice and life at a college . We have some interesting performances here by Omar Epps , as a student , with hang-ups and Laurence Fishburne , as a tough political science professor who chides his own people for being lazy . 4 years before she won the Oscar , Jennifer Connolly again plays a college student . Interestingly , Michael Rapaport , who I believe is Jewish in real life , plays someone weak in mind who is drawn into a neo-Nazi movement with tragedy resulting . The film is good especially when it tries to show that the college crowd try to get together for toleration of each other , but unfortunately violence ensues . The police are made to come off badly in this film . No matter what , black students are routinely harassed and beaten . The picture succeeds since it points out the need for human understanding and tolerance .

Text2: Memorable comedy show of the 1950s . How daring of Lucille Ball to go on television with her Cuban born husband , Desi Arnaz , in 1951 . CBS took a bold step and the dividends certainly paid off . Even though they didn't get along at all off the cameras , Vivian Vance and William Frawley were the perfect neighbors for Lucy and Desi . It was Ethel who was also a part of Lucy's hair-brained schemes . Lucy always wanted to break into show business . Lucy was jealous of Desi . One show was where Lucy thought that Desi was going to kill her . Naturally , the classic shows was where Lucy advertised a vitamin , stepped on grapes , got her head caught in a vase , met various stars , and would be told by Desi to start ' splaining . Fred Mertz ( Frawley ) did a great imitation of Jack Benny's cheapness . Remember Mrs . Trumbull , the landlady ? She was played by Elizabeth Patterson , a veteran actress who played just about everyone's mother in Hollywood . How can we forget the panic that ensued when Lucy told Desi that she was ready to give birth ? We sure loved Lucy .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Jeremiah gazes into an unkempt adult world his young eyes have no reason to witness . Through this unbalanced pretentious film , Argento makes the child's journey dizzying and uncontrolled .

Text2: The Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner is a long series of unfunny comedians who are more interested in seeing if they can drive anyone off stage than in actually saying or doing anything that can be remotely construed as funny . Now , a Roast is not meant to be polite . A roast can and should run the gamut from rough to appalling . But watching Andy Dick trying to gross out everyone by running his tongue over anyone who would hold still for it is not funny . Watching Farrah Fawcett try to get through her canned jokes without breaking up is not funny . As for Lisa Lamparelli , her best line was noting that her career was dead , but she could still get a gig on Comedy Central doing roasts . Indeed she can , so long as there is no requirement that she be funny . Nor do any of these ' comedy ' bits have anything to do with William Shatner . There is much about William Shatner's career that could have served a roast well : Shatner's egotism , his spreading waistline , his propensity for overacting . Yet no one was terribly interested in the subject of William Shatner . Largely , the ' comedians ' were interested in themselves and the apparent belief that all transgressive behavior is funny . Most of the barbs consisted of "" You're fat and have no talent , William Shatner , now I'm going to vomit on the stage , and I love you , Bill . "" The one good routine starts the show , with a rcorded ' telephone conversation ' between Shatner and Leonard Nimony , in which Shatner urges Nimoy to show up , saying it will be fun , and Nimoy saying ' Don't do it .

790,"Text1: The line in the "" Summary Line "" is one of the last in this film - uttered by that consummate Englishman Terry-Thomas . Throughout the film he is usually carrying his brolly , but at this last moment it finally becomes useful . This nice little film came out in 1962 , but failed to do for Terry-Thomas what LOLITA or DR . STRANGELOVE or THE PINK PANTHER did for his fellow comic actor Peter Sellers : turn him into a super star . It really could not do so , for Sellers genius was to transform himself into dozens of different personalities , whereas Terry-Thomas usually played a bounder who got into comic difficulties because of his plotting , or character flaws , or circumstances he could not control . But in BACHELOR FLAT he was playing a decent sort , who finds himself ( without intending it ) to be attractive to females because of his pleasant English manners and erudition . Terry - Thomas is Professor Bruce Patterson , a paleontologist who is teaching in Southern California . He doesn't plan to , but his crisp , clipped English manner has won many fans among the ladies in the university and in the neighborhood that he is residing in . He lives near his girlfriend Helen Bushmill ( Celeste Holm ) , who is headed for Europe for a couple of weeks . Patterson , left on his own devices , soon finds that he is the center of a great deal unwanted attention from the ladies . One of them seems to be a young girl named Libby Smith ( Tuesday Weld ) who actually turns out to be Helen's daughter . He is assisted in trying to solve his problems with Weld and the others by his room-mate Mike Pulaski ( Richard Beymer ) . Pulaski is soon attracted to Smith . In the background , midst all the problems with the ladies , is Patterson's career goal . He has located a large dinosaur bone , and wants to return to the foreign country where he found it to do more digging for the rest of the fossil . This requires financing , and has brought up the attention of Dr . Dylan Bowman ( Howard McNear ) , who is a "" friendly "" rival in the paleontology field . Bowman starts sniffing about to find out what Patterson's discovery is ( the latter has not shown the bone to anyone ) . But when the bone is accidentally buried , Patterson is seen by Bowman digging in the beaches near the bungalow he lives in , and retrieving the bone . As a result , of course , Bowman starts thinking the potential site for the dig is in the California beach that Patterson resides near . As career and girls collide , and as Bushmill returns early , things get out of hand for our doctor . Among other things Bushmill thinks Patterson has become a ladies man . Patterson finds that his quiet lifestyle has been invaded by the ladies ( they put a hole accidentally into his favorite derby hat , in one memorable slow burn ) . He asks Pulaski what to do to win back Bushmill , and in the process of being told what is expected from him as a male , he gets drunk - and proceeds to let his libido take over memorably . The comedy was actually quite sweet , as Terry-Thomas played an average man in over his head . The rest of the cast ably supported him , especially McNear as his sneaky , spying rival - who got the last laugh in the film . It may not have been in the same class as DR . STRANGELOVE , but it was a good showcase for it's star . He didn't always have to play comic cads and bounders .

Text2: George F . Kaufman is probably the greatest collaborator dramatist in American theatrical history . Best recalled for his collaborations with Moss Hart ( YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU ; ONCE IN A LIFETIME ; THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER ) , he also collaborated with Edna Ferber ( STAGEDOOR ) , Morris Ryskind ( THE COCONUTS ) , and with Ring Lardner on this play . But although he was involved in many plays that were actually musicals , Kaufman hated musicals . He felt they were unnatural - people suddenly breaking into songs that interfered with the flow of the narrative . The classic story of how this actually hurt his work is told about THE COCONUTS . Irving Berlin wrote the score , and most of the tunes are third rate Berlin , but he had a tune which Mary Eaton was to sing to Oscar Shaw in the show when he was arrested . It was "" Always "" , which remains a standard to this day among Berlin's tunes . Berlin proudly played the melody for Kaufman , Ryskind , and the producers of the show . Kaufman got bored , and when it was finished revealed how he felt about that song . He went to the piano and played the musical line for "" I'll be loving you . . . always "" , but sang , "" I'll be loving you Tuseday . "" After a few minutes of this , Berlin angrily took back the best tune he had composed for that show . He left such tunes as "" When My Dream Comes True "" and "" The Monkey - Doodle - Doo "" in , which are only recalled now because the film is still a living comedy due to the Marx Brothers . Kaufman probably never cared ( the show was , after all , a success without "" Always "" ) . However , when he wrote JUNE MOON with Ring Lardner , he aimed at Tin Pan Alley the shafts he always felt it deserved . For example , the big hit ( so far ) in the career of Jack Cassidy's / Paul Sears ' is a ditty called , "" Paprika , Paprika , The Spice of My Life . "" Hardly a great sounding tune . Cassidy's character has had a long dry spell since that success . He has found a new partner in Tom Fitzsimmons ( Fred Stevens ) who seems gifted to put Cassidy's words to music . The play has not really dated , but in this production the more serious side of the comedy took over . Basically Cassidy and Stevens are being undermined by Cassidy's wife ( Susan Sarandon - playing a good villain role for a change ) and her sister , who see the newly successful team as good to milk for every cent they can get . Both men eventually do realize they are being used , but it takes awhile for this to happen . Kevin McCarthy plays the head of the music publishing company - he only has one good scene though . Stephen Sondheim plays a cynical piano player who helps straighten out the boys about the women they have been tied to . Estelle Parsons and Austin Pendleton also add to the cast . But it is Cassidy whom I find most interesting as the betrayed Paul . His increasing suspicions are touching , as he realizes something is wrong but he can't quite grasp it . It shows that doomed acting talent in another light , quite different from his appearance in THE ANDERSONVILLE TRIAL , where he was not so naive or trusting for so long . He was a very gifted actor who died too soon . For all the positives in the play I'll give it a "" 6 "" . As I like Broadway musicals ( unlike Kaufman ) I can't give it anymore than that .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Incidentally , this was the film which forced the studio to open a parallel label – Touchstone – so that they could make more adult-oriented fare : its few moments of violence and the appearance of a man in drag , presumably , were the offending elements in this regard ! The title is the typical outfit worn by the detective hero of 1940s film noirs : here , it’s incongruously donned by the irritating would-be thriller novelist Margot Kidder ( ! ) – while the boyish-looking Robert Hays is the typical undercover agent ( whose mission is to catch a ring of plutonium-traffickers ) . I can’t say the script-writers / film-makers were particularly inspired by the Maltese locations – so much so that it could have been set practically anywhere else to much the same dismal effect ( it’s simply not thrilling and certainly not funny ) ! Most of the other characters are seen either aiding or harassing the two leads – sometimes they seem to be doing one when their intention is actually the opposite ; these include clumsy assassin Leopoldo Trieste , laid-back police chief David Suchet ( TV’s future Hercule Poirot ! ) , a couple of sweet old lodgers at Kidder’s hotel , a German mystery woman , and a Sicilian stud . A notable appearance is put in by John Justin ( yes , the hero of the classic Michael Powell / Alexander Korda THE THIEF OF BAGDAD [ 1940 ] in what amounted to his last feature-film role ! ) as the long-suffering aristocratic owner of the hotel , whose place is turned upside-down by the end of the film . By the way , I only spotted two Maltese actors of stature in bit roles – one played a guide at a museum , and the other a fishmonger who helped Kidder evade her pursuers in one scene . For what it’s worth , the identity of the villains is ingenious ( if not exactly original ) ; in the end , though , in spite of a number of chases , the film is never as engaging ( or enjoyable ) as it should have been . . . and only manages to give a bad name to the genre it’s playing at , not to mention the people and country involved !

Further research reveal that the deaths , thanks to pub owner's digging up a body , were caused by a snake bite on the back of the victim's neck . In a vast estate across the moor lives an oddly behaving Dr . Franklyn whose sheltered daughter seems weary of something as both have a guest with them , a mysterious Indian with a sinister gaze , often seen hiding in the shadows surveying everything from a distance , as if harboring an evil , suspicious intent . Harry Spalding ( Ray Barrett ) , with wife Valerie ( Jennifer Daniel ) in tow , receive the cottage of his late brother Charles ( David Baron , who we witness being bitten by a shadowy figure right after the warnings of Dr . Franklyn ( Noel Willman ) to get away , with his body later dumped in the moor by Marne Maitland's Indian ) finding a village of worried folk hesitant about outsiders / newcomers . Harry finds the cottage ransacked , with frustration and anger already setting in . Soon Harry would pursue the reasons behind his brother's mysterious death leading directly to Dr . Franklyn , who is rather wary of anyone drawing near his daughter Anna ( Jacqueline Pearce ) . Franklyn can often be a bit rude , shrugging anyone away who associates with his daughter , as if protecting her ( . . or them ) from possible danger . Soon , we learn just why Franklyn wishes for Anna to stay away from others , who the Indian is ( . . and his association with Franklyn ) , why so many villagers have died by the plague ( . . and where the plague comes from ) , and how Valerie and Harry's snooping will lead to possible harm . Interesting change-of-pace for Hammer studios offering an innocent inflicted with the "" Snake People "" curse and how the village is shaken with quivering fear because of it . Michael Ripper , a Hammer vet known for an extensive list of various supporting roles , gets perhaps the most fleshed out character of his career , as a pub owner who reluctantly joins Harry in his pursuit of the cause of the plague which is killing the citizenry . Noel Willman has the strongest role as a doctor whose travels lead to a tribe yielding a horrifying fate to his daughter . Willman plays him as enigmatic and vague , warning Harry about leaving but not necessarily specifying the danger he ( . . and Valerie ) might face if he doesn't . Willman is stern with Anna , even off-putting in how he orders around . I believe he successfully conveys a tortured man slowly but surely succumbing to the agony of watching the horrors beset upon his lovely daughter . Barrett and Daniel are adequate as the couple who come to realize just what Franklyn was warning about . I was a bit miffed at how Harry is able to survive the snake bite while others dies rather quickly . And , Daniel's Valerie makes some stupid decisions , like walking home alone with a plague killing villagers and actually intruding on Franklyn's estate and manor after her husband is snake-bitten . The make-up work for Anna is decent , but nothing mind-blowing . . although the snake-creature face does have a creepy quality to it with how those fangs protrude and the eyeballs bulge out so . I think it was a good idea to keep the creature hidden for most of the film . The lava pit underneath the house , made for Anna so that she could remain warm , was a bit hard to swallow , I must admit . And , how she drops merely being above ground minutes after leaving the lava pit , from the cold , also was a bit hard for me to accept . And , how the film puts Valerie in peril , thanks to Franklyn's unhinged behavior at the end , rather left me shaking my head as to why she'd be dumb enough to even go there in the first place .

During a bloody battle , the leaders on both sides declared a truce which has remained for hundreds of years . There's "" policing "" of this truce with both factions working to keep it intact by keeping an eye on each other to stay away from harming others . The film focuses on the Light Others as they keep the Dark Others in line . Their police unit is called Night Watch while the Dark Others have Day Watch . The truce hits a bump in the road when Light Other Anton commits a grievous sin when he kills a Dark Vampire trying to harm a child he was protecting under a watchful eye . This sets out an unfortunate unfolding of events as the dead vampire's lady seeks vengeance not only for killing her man but allowing herself to be turned into a dark one . She also craves blood and the Dark Others coerce her into seeking out the young child who seems to have an important role for both Other sides .

That answer might just come thanks to a bad decision Anton made before he found out he was an Other . . it has a lot to do with the Dark Others and their sinister plans .

Surreal and dark thriller that has a number of fine twists and turns in it but it's obvious from the start that the dye was cast and Cooper was to become history by the time the movie ends . There were a number of off-beat moments in the film that didn't seem to make much sense with a dream sequence involving Turner at Cooper's country home that to me came across like an alternate ending that was left in the movie by it's director by mistake . The actual ending in the film with Turner and Cooper at his office in L . A was also very hard to accept since it made the sly and methodical Turner come across unbelievably unprofessional as a professional hit-man .

795,"Text1: Arthur Wontner does the honors as Sherlock Holmes in this 1935 film , while the non-Bond Ian Fleming portrays a dapper Dr . John Watson . This was my first experience of their pairing , and they play off each other well , though the running gag of Watson's nudging Holmes to be introduced to every new character wears thin after a while . Somehow , I think Holmes was sharp enough to get around to it eventually . The story is told in large part via flashback , taking us to America and a secret organization known as the Scowlers , a band of murderers and blackmailers in an area of Pennsylvania . It relies on the recollections of Ettie Douglas ( Jane Carr ) recounting the story of her husband John , who went undercover as a member of the Freemen Scowlers , infiltrating their number for the local police . In doing so , Douglas earned the wrath of Scowler goon Balding ( Ben Welden ) , who in present time has hired the evil Professor Moriarty to kill Douglas . Moriarty , here portrayed by Lyn Harding , is presented as somewhat of a magician , eerily appearing and disappearing in a compact room to Balding's amazement . Holmes ' unique powers of deduction include a scene where he turns his attention to Watson's shaving routine . So it shouldn't come as a surprise that he leads Watson down a path to decoding a numerical message pointing to a murder at Birlstone Castle . Since the murder already took place , it's up to Holmes to uncover the perpetrator . A lot of attention is centered on the rate of burning candles and a missing dumbbell ( not a human ) to solve the crime , and it's uncanny that Holmes knows enough to trawl the moat with an umbrella handle ( ? ) outside a castle window to find a clue . A better one would have been checking the dead body , since the actual victim ( Balding ) had a different build and was shorter than Douglas . I'm sure Holmes took that into account , it just wasn't mentioned . Though the story was interesting enough , and is recommended for Holmes fans , I was dismayed by the apparent death of Professor Moriarty . Granted , this film was released in 1935 , but I viewed it after seeing 1943's "" Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon "" , and 1945's "" The Woman in Green "" . In all three films , Moriarty meets his apparent demise by falling from a height . I would have appreciated some originality , at least in the latter two .

Text2: I hadn't realized what a consummate actor Robert Duvall was until "" Open Range "" . When his character is on screen , one gets the impression that it's really Boss Spearman on display , a cantankerous trail boss with a lifetime's worth of defining right and wrong . His world view is based on honesty and integrity , and doesn't allow for sixteen year old card cheats . Charley Waite ( Kevin Costner ) is of similar stripe , but he shows it more liberally , by booting his card cheat hired hand into the river . Those who complain that the early scenes move too slowly overlook the profundity of the set up . A man doesn't leave his friends behind or take the easy way out . He can't abide a murdering dog who would murder his dog . Backed into a corner and forced to take a stand , one begins to understand that there are "" things that gnaw at a man worse than dyin "" . There's a defining scene for Costner's character as the men lie under the night time prairie skies . Charley's midnight confession about his murderous past takes on added dimension as the camera slowly pulls away to reveal his cartridge belt . It adds perspective to the final showdown ; Charley's role as strategist has him lay out the confrontation right up to the part where they might get killed . And then the bullets fly . But it's justice , not revenge , that tempers this gunfight , even when Boss has Baxter at his mercy he defers to his own advice to Charley earlier . Justice , not revenge . Both as a an actor and director , Kevin Costner seems to be a lightning rod for his projects . "" Dances With Wolves "" , and "" Field of Dreams "" have been equally applauded and derided by movie goers over the years , and "" Open Range "" follows that pattern . For my part , I found it to be a masterful story transcending it's Western genre formula , finding poignancy in it's tale of men willing to focus on what's right , not who's right .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
796,"Text1: The first 30 minutes of this Buster Keaton film are some of the stupidest he ever made , at least from what I've seen . I don't blame him ; this is the film world where even since this period - around 1920 - marriage is always trivialized and people are always lying . Why was that so frequent in classic movies , in particular ? It's disgusting . Here Alfred "" Battling "" Butler , a spoiled rich young man - in order to keep his girl - lies about being the lightweight boxing champion of the world , because that guy , who has the same name as him , is a hero and he wants to impress her and her big brother and big father . He wants to marry her right away because she's pretty and she consents as soon as she hears he's a big shot . Boy , those are great reasons for marriage ! After the quickie marriage , Buster heads off for training camp for his supposed title defense against the "" Alabama Murderer . "" Later , the real "" Battling Butler , "" to do the impostor a favor and save his marriage , lets him be the real thing and fight while he retires . The training - and the first real laugh of the film - isn't until 47-minute mark when Buster begins training and can't get over the ropes . He is helpless outside and inside the ring as it turns out . The training escalates as Buster begins roadwork the next day . . . . . but he isn't up to training or fighting or any of this . Fortunately , a big twist occurs late in the movie which saves Buster from going into the ring , although the little man does save his honor after he fights the real "" Battling Butler .

After a slow start - about 40 minutes to set things up - it's almost non-stop action the rest of the way as American soldiers fight in the streets of Somalia . Frankly , it was too much action for me , but I'm not a kid anymore so non-stop action gets a bit tiring after 20 minutes . This thing goes almost non-stop for 100 straight minutes .

When they say , "" based on a true story "" that could mean as much as 90 percent of it is fictionalized for dramatic purposes . However , reports are that it is pretty accurate . Regardless , the film has some good things going for it . First of all there is the military credo : : "" Never leave anyone behind . "" That message certainly is demonstrated here even at the cost of about 20 American lives and who knows who many Somalis as soldiers go back into action to rescue men after a helicopter ( named Black Hawk ) goes "" down . "" With today's filmmakers and special effects capabilities , you get Saving Private Ryan-type realistic action scenes . That also means you get some gruesome scenes , too .

In this film , you see bunch of interesting orange-ish colors , great lighting and great facial closeups . The sound also is excellent with bullets "" flying out "" of all the surround speakers .

Text2: Mildly interesting ( if typically muddled ) 1960s European-set political thriller – while not as glum as many of its ilk , it’s still hampered by an essentially far-fetched premise and the occasional silly passage ( more on this later ) . The plot involves a proposed coup d’etat in France organized by the exiled ‘Algerian’ elite : apparently , this web of intrigue already holds most of the country’s high places in its grip and has even started to spread across to the United States ! ; the head of these aristocratic dissidents is played by Orson Welles . Enter rugged ( if washed-up ) boxer George Peppard who , surprisingly , finds himself recruited as tutor to a boy who’s the future hope of said organization ; the latter’s mother ( the ill-fated Inger Stevens , who’s quite radiant here ) is obviously frustrated by this arrangement – seeking comfort in alcohol and , eventually , Peppard’s affections . The widow of a famed General , she had suffered a nervous breakdown ; her doctor , played by Keith Michell , doesn’t take kindly to Peppard’s presence in the house – for a reason we only learn of towards the end . Anyway , both hero and heroine soon become a danger to the safety of the operation – so , when Stevens’ son is kidnapped by Welles and company ( while framing Peppard for the murder of his own best friend ) , the couple decide to escape together in an effort to outwit the villains and rescue the boy . Their journey takes them to several other ‘bases’ being used by the gang : a château ( where they’ve already begun assembling the army for the eventual take-over ) , a little house by the river in Italy ( to which the fugitive duo travel by train ) and , later , an abandoned monastery ( ! ) in Rome . After a brief tete-a'-tete in a sauna , Peppard and Welles decide to meet for an exchange ( the hero has come into possession of a list with the names of the secret society’s associates in America ) at the Coliseum ; when he gets there , Peppard is met by the boy – who’s been brainwashed into killing the former – but , predictably , he turns on Welles instead . . . who , trying to evade his aim , lamely falls to his death ! The latter is one of the silly passages I mentioned at the beginning ; another is a scene aboard the train in which Stevens has to distract a burly official by parading around the compartment in her underwear ; not to mention the one in which , having no money when the car they ‘borrowed’ runs out of gas , Peppard and Stevens decide to pinch the coins famously thrown for luck by tourists in the Trevi fountain ! Commendably , the film maintains a good pace throughout – with much of the heavy-going aspects of the plot relegated to the first half ; besides , it delivers in most areas where this type of gene effort usually excels : attractive Widescreen photography , a notable score ( and theme song ) by Francis Lai and , of course , lovely girls ( apart from Stevens , we get sexy Perrette Pradier – with whom I was unfamiliar – and , in one scene , Rosemary Dexter from Jess Franco’s MARQUIS DE SADE’S JUSTINE [ 1968 ] and the Malta-filmed VENDETTA FOR THE SAINT [ 1969 ] ) . Also in the cast are Ralph Michael ( the would-be murderer in "" The Haunted Mirror "" , a celebrated episode from the classic horror compendium DEAD OF NIGHT [ 1945 ] , as Stevens’ apparently genial brother-in-law ) and beefy "" Euro-Cult "" regular Renzo Palmer as one of the organization’s choice thugs ( at one point , passing himself off as a monk – complete with trademark shaven head ! ) . Incidentally , HOUSE OF CARDS ( adapted from Stanley Ellin’s novel by the husband-and-wife team of Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr . – albeit under the pseudonym James P . Bonner , and where the significance of the titular Tarot cards has been all but eliminated ! ) was the last of three consecutive films director Guillermin made with George Peppard in the lead – the others being the WWI epic THE BLUE MAX ( 1966 ) and the detective thriller P .

Silly sequel ; truly a disappointment from a talented horror veteran ( Wes Craven ) , from whom I expect more than just a run-of-the-mill slasher film , which is what this is .

This entry in the series is just sadistic and bloody enough ( at least in unrated form ) to satisfy horror fans . Director Jeff Burr , working from a script by "" splatterpunk "" author David J . Schow , keeps the story progressing at a steady pace . The movie is fairly lively , amusing , and has some good set pieces going for it .

Text2: The warring states of Ancient China serve as a backdrop for this pan-Asian war epic , starring the charismatic Andy Lau . Going by the literal translation of the Chinese title , it's "" Ink War "" , alluding to the fact that much of the battles in this movie relies a lot more on superior strategy in order to overcome a mammoth battle against a Goliath , with a 4 , 000 population up against the might of a 100 , 000 strong well-trained army . Based on a Japanese novel / manga Bokkou , Battle of Wits fictionalizes one of the episodes during 370BC , where China was still divided , and each nation seizing opportunities to usurp the other . Those familiar with history will know that eventually , the kingdom of Qin will ultimately unite the Middle Kingdom for the first time . However , the story sets its sights on the Kingdom of Zhao leading an attack on the smaller state of Liang . In its defence lies a mysterious man from the Mozhi tribe known as Ge Li ( Andy Lau of course ) , who galvanizes Liang's population to stage a stand against what seemingly looks like impossible odds . While war movies of long , long time ago have been flogged to death recently by Hollywood , with films like Alexander , Troy , and fantasy epics like the Lord of the Rings series , Asian movies have rarely scratched the surface until of late , with Battle of Wits leading the charge , and coming right up are at least two film adaptations of episodes from the Romance of the Three Kingdom novels . For those expecting fantastical and romanticized wu-xia martial arts moves , you will be disappointed , as this movie is rooted much in reality . Given the epic scale of this production , it still rings a sense of familiarity in its war scenes , and I thought that shooting most of them in middle-close range , loses much of its grandeur . The big spectacles shown have nothing new that will take your breath away , especially after Hollywood has plundered such productions . Nonetheless it augurs well that Battle of Wits managed to pull off a production of this nature , and has , surprise , a competent storyline to carry it through . There is a strong anti-war message that got worn on the sleeves Ge Li , as smart and cunning as he is , he's the reluctant hero , willing to make sacrifices for the greater good . He finds no pleasure in war , nor killings , but in order to save the masses , he must do what he has to thwart efforts of bloodthirsty kingdoms . He's is the message of "" loving thy enemy "" , naturally not shared by the incompetent leadership in Liang . And since time immemorial , you always have the incompetents possessing the heart of insolence , with characters of sloth and ill intentions , straddling from a high horse . Inept leaders silencing their opposition through calls of treason is a tactic all too familiar , which makes it all the more despondent as you ponder about that aged old Chinese proverb about there being nothing wrong in looking after your personal interests first , instead of bothering with the affairs of others . Ge Li faces both the task of winning over the people's trust ( since they're committing the state's defences to his organization ) , and the inevitable unappreciative , thankless task of having to do just that . As I mentioned , do not expect to see "" Qing Gong "" or fancy swordplay . Rather I was in awe with the delivery of strategies and counter strategies in having two warring factions pitting their wits against each other . Sometimes they come rather unexpectedly , and will leave you with a smile , like when you're wondering just what everyone is up to when they close their eyes en masse . Accompanied by an excellent soundtrack , the movie could be split down two halves , and while the first centered on the macro affairs , a more micro , personal affairs of the heart managed to creep in between Ge Li and Yi Yue ( the gorgeous Fan Bingbing ) , a calvary officer , and though their romance sometimes stalled the pace of the movie , it added some gravitas to Ge Li the Man , questioning his strong beliefs on being unselfish , and made the finale all the more heart-wrenching to watch . Featuring stars like Wu Ma and Nicky Wu ( when was the last time I saw them in a movie ) and Korean actor Ahn Sung-kee , this certainly is the movie to watch this week . Forget about them animated penguins , treat yourself to an epic worthy of your time , and well worth a weekend ticket .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: An archaeological dig unearths the ancient Egyptian burial tomb of High Preistess Princess Ananka . Inside a secret burial chamber is the mummified corpse of Kharis ( Christopher Lee ) imprisoned for blaspheming the laws of their god in his attempts to bring Ananka back from the dead using the sacred Scroll of Life , because of his devoted love for her . John Banning's ( Peter Cushing ) father , Stephen ( Felix Aylmer ) doesn't heed the warnings of Mehemet Bey ( George Pastell ) regarding the desecration of his Princess ' tomb . Stephen , who removes the Scroll of Life from it's place , doesn't realize that in doing so opens the burial chamber door . Making matters even worse , Stephen reads text from the scroll which bring life back to Kharis as he exits his chamber . While Stephen is overcome with hysteria at what he just saw , Mehemet Bey takes command of the scroll and Kharis , vowing to kill the three who entered the sacred tomb of his goddess , removing precious artifacts that belong where they were placed . Returning to England , John's father slowly awakens from his emotional plight while resting in a nursing home , to inform his son of Kharis . Thinking his father still ill , John is concerned but bothered by such a statement . When placed in a padded cell after a frightened outburst , Stephen is attacked and killed by Kharis , ordered by Mehemet Bey , when the mummy intruded through a heavily shielded window . Later , John's uncle is strangled right before his eyes after Kharis explodes through his front door . John realizes that his father wasn't just raving madly , and faces the fact that he's next to die . While his testimony of his uncle's killer being in a "" comatose state of living death "" to the police makes him sound loony , John will attempt to face off with Kharis , only to be saved by his wife , Isobel ( Yvonne Furneaux ) who is the spitting image of Ananka . After the attack , Inspector Mulrooney ( Eddie Byrne ) will inform John about an Egyptian who lives not too far from the asylum where his father was murdered . Mulrooney tells him of a crate falling into a bottomless bog , carrying "" relics "" to the home of this Egyptian , for which John will take it upon himself to meet the man who is indeed Mehemet Bey . Bey will this time follow Kharis to the home of John in one last attempt to fulfill the goal of repairing the honor of his people for the desecration . It was finally cool for me to sit down and check out Hammer's take on the Universal Mummy series . Obviously , being a major Cushing fan , I enjoyed his starring as the archaeologist , with a bum knee he didn't get repaired , having to use his wits to defeat the much stronger undead foe . I was equally pleased with Pastell as Cushing's true foe , Mehemet Bey , who is actually controlling Kharis as a killing device . There's a great scene where John and Bey meet at the Egyptian's English home . . John attempts to ruffle Bey's feathers by attacking , in a wonderfully sophisticated manner , his beliefs which will incite his anger leading him to act against his nemesis , exposing his guilt . While the sets and props used for the Egyptian tomb and people look like exactly that ( . . which , unlike purists , didn't bother me the slightest , understanding Hammer's limited budget ) , I found Lee ( cutting that tall imposing figure as he bursts through doors and windows , strangling smaller victims with ease ) as the mummy , "" swathed in bandages "" and covered in bog mud , quite effective . Sure Jack Pierce's detailed mummy wraps for Karloff are superior to those in Hammer's film , but Lee still looks quite menacing ( . . and , a credit to his performance , where we can see only his eyes , he brings extra emotion during the scenes where Kharis sees Isobel , obeying her commands , the presence of love and sadness echoing what he felt as a dashing Egyptian servant so long ago ) and his bandages are decent enough . It's a tall order for anyone to match the Pierce design , whether it be werewolf or mummy , so I cut Hammer some slack . As far as the premise for this "" re-imagining "" , basically Hammer takes the best elements from Universal's Mummy series , combining them to create this entertaining effort . You have Kharis being controlled by a shadowy Egyptian hiding in secrecy as he orders his weapon of destruction towards "" unbelievers "" who dare desecrate the tombs of his people's civilizations . You have John's wife Isobel baring a striking resemblance to Ananka which the archaeologist will use to save himself from harm . You have the Mummy killing members of an archaeological dig with English police baffled as to what kind of fiend could commit such murderous deeds . But , ultimately , the success can be contributed to the big three , Cushing / Lee / Fisher joining forces once again bringing us yet another thrilling horror tale . The film provides a flashback to Ananka's burial and Kharis ' fate at trying to resurrect her ( . . with us getting to see a human Lee in Egyptian garb and face paint ) as John reads through his father's notes , speaking about their ways and beliefs .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

As soon as the three men are together , the film has the accents of a road-movie like "" Tandem "" a previous Leconte effort and the best in all his filmography . A road-movie shot in a hectic pace and peppered with preposterous meetings and events . When the film opened in French theaters in February 1993 , Patrice Leconte was wrongly accused of misogyny . Its detractors couldn't understand the whole film . Men can't live without women . Just have a look at Vincent : after he killed his wife and after having been acquitted , he seems gloomy . And as for Paul , although he can't stand the idea that his wife is still alive and may live her life with another man , he's undecided about the acting . Even the judge doesn't seem to really hate women . After the sequence when Judith Godrèche killed her husband , he doesn't arrest her and even authorizes Vincent to have a baby with her behind the bushes in the country ! Anyway , feminist characters are overall positive so "" Tango "" : a misogynous film ? Definitely not . . . Earlier in my review , I wrote in my review that "" Tango "" wasn't at the same level than the other Leconte films I mentioned . Very simply because when our threesome philosophize about the relationships between men and women and why they can't live together , the film becomes draggy and talky . The filmmaker tapped this function on the staple story to beef his film up but when it comes at the foreground , the machine turns without gripping and the interest somewhat wanes . These drawbacks stop the film from taking its place among Leconte's very winners . But apart from these somewhat intellectual pretensions , "" Tango "" shouldn't be dismissed all the same . In this entertaining black comedy , the Leconte touch runs throughout the film and should make the fans flock to it . This filmmaker has nearly always the gift to collaborate with peerless scenarists who scatter his films with potent cues . Then , "" Tango "" shelters strong sequences like the very first one during the opening credits . As a matter of fact , the first twenty minutes during which Leconte indulges himself with two spoofs of "" North by Northwest ( 1959 ) by Hitchcock could justify the screening of the film . Another strong moment is the one when Noiret acquits Vincent : one can hear his voice but one can't see him . And still from Leconte this taste for the oddball , absurd detail . You have to see Noiret talking to his cat like to a human being or Borhinger fishing with a fishing rod without a line . "" Tango "" isn't a new pinnacle in Leconte's career for the reason I previously mentioned but it shouldn't be rejected . Helped by its assets and a three-star cast , Leconte's fans should reassure themselves : they are in well-known lands . For me , Leconte will reach new heights again with his next film , the summery , nearly dreamlike "" le Parfum d'Yvonne "" ( 1994 ) which should have known a better commercial fate than its commercial fiasco .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

I wanted him to die in battle . Be assassinated in his sleep . Anything noble . But instead , he was given a peaceful eternity . OK , fine . I have no choice but to deal with it . While I respect Piccard as Captain of the Enterprise , he will never be James Tiberius Kirk . But this is the end of the old series and the beginning of the new ; hence the name "" Generations . "" If you are a fan of these movies , a collector of anything Star Trek , this is a definite needful addition to the set . This is the movie which ties the two series together . Meet Captain Piccard and crew . I'll assume you're already familiar with them and I won't bore you with the details . Over the years , I have developed ( if somewhat begrudgingly ) an appreciation for this new crew and cast of players . . . and , while I still mourn the loss of the legends I loved , I look upon them as new neighbors , of sorts ; with a certain measured withdrawn fondness .

You could always look at the Enterprise and just knew that , "" Hey , there's kinda like a flying saucer on the top front half ! "" But this movie actually did it . It marks a milestone in the series and in this line of movies . I also must say that the way they brought Kirk and Piccard together was sloppy and puerile .

Text2: This movie is the true story of Nick Leeson ( the fantastic Ewan McGregor ) , the employee who broke the oldest bank in England , the Bearings Bank . Nick is an ambitious young man , son of a simple man who works with plaster , transferred to Singapore to operate in future market of derivatives . He was considered the best employee of Bearing Banks , but indeed he was gambling with high amounts of the bank and hiding the losses under a secret account number 88888 . There are at least three points to highlight in this movie . The first one is the great performance of Ewan McGregor . Everybody knows he is an excellent actor and once again he does not disappoint the viewer . Second is about the screenplay , based on a book written by Nick Leeson : is it possible to believe that the oldest bank in England was managed by a board of directors that look like the Little Red Ridding Hood ( instead of the bad wolf ) ? Everywhere in the world , persons very aware of cash flow administrate banks . How could one unique employee keep the real situation hidden from the Bearings Senior Management ? I believe it would be almost impossible , therefore it seems that some kind of arrangement may be made having Nick as the scapegoat of the whole situation ( or high profits were expected in those dirty operations ) with the participation of other important persons in the bank . Anyway , if this film shows the truth , it is amazing how this bank had survived for such a long time . Last but not the least , is it possible to believe that a smart guy like Nick Leeson ' has not reserved ' some money for his early retirement ? It is hard to believe !

While he's not as stupid as Jim Carrey when he's trodding the same ground , he is equally annoying . In the Cat in the Hat , Myers does what he's done before in most of his films of late and that is to be silly in the most annoying manner and voice he can think of . The idea of turning Dr Seuss ' book about the events on a rainy day into a full length feature was not the brightest idea , simply because there isn't enough material to fill the film out to anything approaching 90 minutes . The film makers didn't learn from Grinch which only worked when it dealt with material from the book , unfortunately in the case of the Cat that material is all over the place , the film is mostly new material so it just doesn't work . The film also suffers from the biggest problem with adapting Seuss - his stuff never looks right off the printed page . Its never truly real so you never believe .

810,"Text1: In 1952 , Charles Crichton had produced a successful suspenseful movie with a derivative premise : a man ( an excellent Dirk Bogarde ) compelled to take a brat hostage with him because he was the witness of his murder and to flee with him across Britain to escape the police . This journey had brought the two runaways together and Bogarde eventually felt real love and care for his young hostage . Crichton ( I find it hard to believe that it's the same man who 36 years later will cook "" a Fish Called Wanda "" , 1988 ! ) had construed his topic with a lot of reserve and sensitivity which bestowed his wonderful piece of work with pathos and tenderness . 40 years later , Clint Eastwood , freshly showered with praise for his dusky "" Unforgiven "" ( 1992 ) takes back this formula for a flick which basically was to be directed by Steven Spielberg but the latter had a lot to do with "" Schindler's List "" ( 1994 ) , probably his finest moment . The amount was "" a Perfect World "" ( 1993 ) and it deserves better than the lukewarm reviews it received and stands as a winner in Eastwood's eclectic filmography . In spite of a few installments in its second part that one can deem as overlong , it has enough commendable stuff to grab the audience . First , Eastwood's vehicle is helped by the work of John Lee Hancock who 4 years later will pen the scenario for another Eastwood flick : "" Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil "" ( 1997 ) . Because it eschews the formulaic ingredients of the movie genre , "" a Perfect World "" deals with and it encompasses various tones : from the droll moments Kevin Costner goes through with his young hostage to gripping scenes which incommodes the audience ( the scene when Costner holds the black family in their living room with a song he hadn't heard for years ) , the script takes the viewer by surprise . It's true that suspense takes a back seat during most of the viewing but Eastwood's flick has other stuff in store . In the favorable reviews , it has been said that the relationships between Costner and his young partner were highly interesting . From their first confrontation , Costner has an evident interest in the little boy , a nagging curiosity that will grow throughout his run . In this way , his attitude , at least in the outset of the film is quite different from Bogarde's . The latter realizing that he has no other choice to take his brat with him expresses at first hostility and scorn before starting to get interested in him . Not Costner who is clearly interested with his hostage from the outset and for whom he feels affection . In the two flicks , the little boys may see in Bogarde and Costner the father figures they never had . Their households are characterized by an absence of father . As for Costner , he unveils to his partner , scraps of his anterior life which might explain one of his attitudes towards him . Maybe , he tries to play his role of father and this way to get close to him : "" we have a lot of things in common you and me : we love Coke , we never had father "" . He wants to make him discover a new life , a freer and more maverick one in which anything goes ( he asks him to write the things he craves to do ) . Nature plays a momentum role in "" a Perfect World "" : it surrounds the characters and is of a vivacious green which symbolizes bliss and hope . In this perfect world , the two main protagonists try to search for support , friendship , bliss but impending danger waits around the corner . Eastwood's flick was also decried because the other sequences of the film in which Eastwood and his crew appear were rather weak . I don't think so . True the character of Laura Dern is a little formulaic but in one sequence the most important members offer their vision of a perfect world . And even if here he doesn't hold the main role , Clint Eastwood has a prime secondary part . The cast is a major asset of the film . The little boy is directed with care and respect and Eastwood gave Costner his last great hour , given the duds in which he acted afterward : the horrible "" Waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a waste of money and time and the insipid "" Postman "" ( 1997 ) . Coming after a pinnacle in his career , "" Unforgiven "" , I feel that Eastwood wasn't hampered by this critical and commercial triumph and broke new ground in the fugitive movie with this startling piece of work . Give this movie a chance . It deserves it . And if you have the chance to see "" Hunted "" , don't think twice . Eastwood's flick compares favorably with his 40 year old model . And after the projection , try to ask yourself this question : what is a perfect world ?

Text2: . In France , when the movie was released , a lot of critics snubbed it , putting disparagement on it , because it could not hold a candle to Buzzati's masterpiece . But as Jean Cocteau said , critics judge art works , and they don't know they are judged by them ! Valerio Zurlini and his producer-star Jacques Perrin were faithful to the novel . They succeeded in bringing to the screen one of the most abstract , metaphoric , and also depressing literature masterworks of the last century . Perrin is well cast as Drogo , the young officer waiting , waiting , for something that never comes : the tartars attack symbolizes everything you long for , and when it seems it's happening , it's too late . Once proud and brave and full of great expectations , the hero becomes humble and bent , under the burden of the years passing by , inexorably , leaving him a human wreck . In this desolate landscape , in this infinite space , man is not numbered like every grain of sand . The grandiose shots of the desert , the mountains and this strange abandoned city , which seems to contain some mysteries of ancient times , all this contrasts terribly with man's fate : see his ridiculous ceremonies , his military iron discipline , his derisory and laughable "" career "" , he who's only a breath in Time , only a little dandruff in an universe that eludes him . Zurlini's movie is not totally satisfying when recreating the erosion of time . In the book , it was unbearable . But he made a movie any director should be proud of , a movie that must be seen because the task was hard , and the results are sometimes sumptuous . Perrin portrays Drogo with a great conviction . As a producer , he had serious difficulties , he had to fight to convince , and the end of the movie - which was intended to be , like in the book , in an inn - could not be filmed because the actor / producer was running out of money .

The late , great , forever glowering Vic Morrow , sporting longish hair , an over-sized cowboy hat , and a permanent frown on his rough , craggy , puffy , yet handsome face , makes for a real happening heavy as Franklin , the shrewd , dogged , hard-nosed police captain who obsessively tracks the outlaw threesome via helicopter .

Popping up in solid supporting parts are Roddy McDowall in an uncredited bit role as the antsy grocery store manager , Kenneth Tobey as Morrow's unyielding , disapproving jerk of a superior , and especially the amazing Eugene Daniels as Hanks , an uproariously overzealous eager beaver deputy who spits out a lot of choice hateful dialogue ( Hank's "" Eat you lunch line "" in particular is absolutely priceless ! ) .

Mike Marguiles ' expert cinematography is exceptional : sweeping aerial photography , fluid tracking shots and tight , sweaty close-ups are all put to powerful use during the superbly staged car chase sequences . Moreover , the salient absence of a music score actually heightens rather than detracts from the fiercely maintained suspense ; the film manages to acquire a semi-documentary feel which makes both the story and the action that much more convincing and involving . Why , we even have a profound and provocative subtext about the desperate measures down and out people with nothing to lose will resort to get out of a dismal rut they feel like they're trapped in .

One problem is the era it was made . With very few exceptions ( A good one is PLATOON ) films from the mid 1980s lack substance , they're basically eye candy .

It should also be pointed out that Peter Jackson has changed the whole face of fantasy cinema with his vision of LORD OF THE RINGS , no longer can a critic tolerate camp fantasy , everything must be breath taking and deadly serious . I've also can't help noticing with repeated viewing that that the ethnocentric portrayal of Highland Scots is grossly insulting , no one but no one says things like "" Heavens mon , ah peed my kilt "" .

813,"Text1: OMG has there been a movie icon hotter than Jane Russell in THE OUTLAW ? I don't think so either . Her smouldering sexuality is the yardstick in which to judge all woman on Earth and the likes of Monroe are second best when compared to this definitive sex goddess . And to think some people describe the likes of Jay-Lo or Abi Titmuss as the most beautiful woman who has ever lived Unfortunately Ms Russell is the only thing THE OUTLAW is remembered for , which is by no means a bad thing since this is an absolutely terrible movie . From the opening scene featuring a sheriff who gives a performance that resembles a circus clown giving a portrayal of a homo-erotic wet dream to the final credits this movie is an ordeal to sit through . It's badly directed with tons of very poor acting and ridiculous back projection and is so factually incorrect as to be laughable . Did I say it was laughable ? Maybe that's why the musical score has a comedy soundtrack complete with a WAH WAH WAH WAH sound that belongs in a three stooges feature ? I would have happily given THE OUTLAW but because of the presence of Russell we're treated to something of a movie landmark - We're treated to on screen sex . Billy The Kid ravishes Rio Mcdonald in a hay loft 30 years before Clint Eastwood did an identical scene in HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and in a later scene Rio asks Billy if he'll look at her while he does it , and the audience is left in no doubt what "" It "" is . Boy this must have caused people to drop dead in their seats on its initial release . Despite the controversy it's still an awful movie though

Hey you don't honestly think I was gonna give DON'T GO NEAR THE PARK a good write up do you ? How on earth can anyone enjoy a movie which comes in a video box with a blood drenched man guzzling a human heart on its cover ? And before you ask It wasn't me who chose this from the video store many years ago The story ( for want of a better word ) starts with a supernatural being who looks like David Copperfield feasting upon human hearts centuries ago .

Bondi leaves home due to her mother's jealousy due to her father's love : "" Gold . You never fin ' gave me gold "" which seems to give the movie an angle of teenage angst . Of course this is obviously coincidental because it's safe to say that no one working on this production will have ever heard of a sophisticated word like angst , I mean a script that has lines like "" If you want to be my brother stop feeling me up . Brothers don't feel up sisters "" is not very sophisticatedStrange that all the reviewers on this page have never gone into detail about the plot of DON'T GO NEAR THE PARK and from memory I'm having a lot of problems trying to remember what the plot was . I could tell you what happens but I don't want to spoil your enjoyment and just like in an overblown James Bond movie lots of things may happen in the narrative but that doesn't necessarly mean the film has a plot , more of a rambling set of scenes with someone getting killed every few minutes That's a joke by the way .

Dames certainly classifies as wonderful nonsense . A wacky millionaire who's a sideline puritan is going to leave a bequest to a cousin and her family providing that they are of good moral character by his ideas . The wacky millionaire is Hugh Herbert and the cousin is Zasu Pitts , her husband Guy Kibbee and her daughter Ruby Keeler . There's another distant cousin Dick Powell who's already out of the will because he's an actor . Back then theatrical folk were held in some disdain by polite society , though that's hard to believe now . Also some eyebrows might have been raised with Dick's involvement with Ruby . But then again the president of the United States was married to his fifth cousin . I'm sure the brothers Warner knew that full well when Dames was released . Dames of course is remembered for those wonderful Busby Berkeley numbers and one of the biggest movie songs ever in I Only Have Eyes For You . Introduced by Dick Powell it was never commercially recorded by him though dozens of our best singers have done so . It's a favorite of mine for sure . Last but not least Dames features the always captivating Joan Blondell who's not above a little blackmail to achieve her ends . A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do . She's featured in the Girl at the Ironing Board number , a great piece of Berkeley magic . We can't forget the title song because as Dick Powell sings , it's what you see the show for . And in that finale they're sure enough of them to satisfy any red blooded male .

Text2: I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby . Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant . Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank . When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting , that it wasn't possible to top it . She might not have topped it , but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word . Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero , no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies . But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust . Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story , but not romance , not hardly in that sense . Clint is a lonely old man , alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train . Boxing is integrated now , women do participate against each other to be sure , but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting . So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism . I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald . It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank , but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life . There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill . The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently . To use that phrase from another recent film classic , Swank completes Eastwood . She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life . It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more , but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank . Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004 . It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress . And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award . It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby , he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy . I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity , always strive for your personal best . Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way . And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes . This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now . We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Despite being reminiscent of I don't know how many other films I kept having a sense that I've seen this film before r at least part of it since the first third really struck a bell . After that its anyone's guess because the film's plot is somewhat unhinged and not very clear . I replayed a couple of sections more than once and I'm certain that the filmmakers were going for effect rather than narrative clarity . Built more for slow building fear and suspense the film is rather free of gore and blood , there is some in appropriate moments , but considering how gory and shocky films are these days its nice to have one that takes a different approach . I wish I could say that the film worked , but I can't . As a collection of sequences and moods the film is quite good . As something that hangs together I'm less impressed . Its questioning of reality and repeating of events is done a couple of times too many . Its clever for a while but eventually it drains much of the life out of it .

819,"Text1: I didn't get a chance to see this film in its theatrical debut because it disappeared very quickly from the local screens . I recently caught it in DVD form . Judging by comments I had heard , I was expecting to see something that was either bad , or not up to par with other Brian DePalma's work . While it is not a remarkable piece of film making , it still holds one's interest ; it is impossible to forget , as its images stay with the viewer . First of all , I would question the choice of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the leading lady of the film . She is a breathtaking beauty , much too gorgeous for the part ; her acting hurts the character she plays . She projects raw sexuality whenever we see her in risque poses , but somehow these scenes in which she appears as a sex obsessed woman , don't ring true . The first sequence when Ms Romijn-Stamos is watching "" Double Jeopardy "" on television , is a key to what will come later . This is a story that appears to be something at one level , while having nothing to do with what one thinks , at all . It would have helped enormously , in one's humble opinion , that maybe another writer would have given a different twist to the story , as one cannot believe for a moment that the parents of the grieving Laure can confuse her with another person , even though it's the same actress and she's obviously wearing a wig . Antonio Banderas ' papparazzo fares better in the logical department . He is used by Ms Romijn-Stamos in more ways than one . Mr . DePalma has been kind to Mr . Banderas , whose choice of film roles is an enigma . Mr . DePalma's take on the Cannes film festival and Paris opens the film as he obviously loves spectacle and the city and takes pains to show it to the viewer in all its splendor . One would only have wished for a better plotted scenario , but otherwise , this is an elegant DePalma for all to savor .

Text2: It takes a talented director and his collaborating screen writer to turn a typical American story into a bourgeois French drama with a different take on the same basic premise . That is what Claude Chabrol , and Cecile Maistre , who is also his step-daughter , accomplished with this film about obsession and lust that involves a an emotional triangle that one knows is doomed from the start . Gabrielle Deniege , a young television weather person in Lyon , seems to be enjoying herself ; she has a promising career and from what one sees , she is the object of desire by her TV boss , who will , no doubt , push her to bigger things in exchange of sexual favors . Alas , Gabrielle has a mind of her own , but even she can't resist the advances of the much older Chales Saint-Denis , a writer she happens to meet at the store where her mother manages . Charles takes a shine to the young woman , who in turn is seduced by the idea of being with the older man . At the same time , the rich young heir of a pharmacy fortune , Paul Gaudens , appears at the same book signing session . He too , it seems , is impressed by young Gabrielle . He begins pursuing her , but little does he know Gabrielle is already involved with Saint-Denis . The older lover takes her to his secret apartment in the city , as well as introducing her to the naughty club he frequents . He has another thing in mind , as we shall learn later on . In the meantime , when the old man decides to go on a trip to England , he drops Gabrielle to fend for herself . Paul , seizes on the opportunity to show how much he cares by taking her to Lisbon , although their affair is , in a sense , a puritanical one . Since Gabrielle senses that Charles is out of the picture , she decides to marry Paul on the rebound . When Saint-Denis shows up again , it's already too late . This film that evidently was made for television shows a different Chabrol , a man who has made a career as a master of the suspense . Alas , there is not so much in this picture , but the viewer is hooked from the beginning of the story , as he knows there will be fireworks out of the elements at stake . The three principals , Ludivine Sagnier , Francois Berleand , and Benoit Magimel , that appear as the angles of the romantic trio , do fine work under Mr . Chabrol's direction . We particularly liked the work of Mr . Berleand , who gives us an excellent chance to enjoy his nuanced performance . Ms . Saigner keeps getting better all the time , and the same could be said about Mr . Magimel , a promising young actor who worked with the director in "" La fleur du mal "" .

Here we have a young man who has escaped a nasty asylum and manages to get home ( four miles ) and change into his brother's clothes , and be downstairs in a matter of moments , having assumed his brother's identity and shaved ( and showered ? he was awful sweaty-looking ) . Anyway , this is Dave ( played by Klaus Kinski ) who has assumed the identity of his brother Richard . Dave's been in the nut-house for killing the family gardener . Meanwhile , someone stalks the halls of the estate with the deadly Blue Hand , a metal glove , of sorts , with retractable claws , for those nasty gouges that cause immediate death in all they touch . And , there's something going on with wrongful commitments to the asylum in an attempt for someone to get an inheritance , or something along those lines . It's not terribly clear . There's also a dour butler with deadpan delivery who is quite amusing . This pretty fun to watch , despite its shortcomings , and has a cool jazzy 60's soundtrack which is also very enjoyable . The Bloody Dead version has added footage of cannibalistic inmates at the asylum but none of the additions do much for improving the coherence of the story . Anyway this is fun in a kind of odd way , and if you don't mind some cheesy effects and plot holes a mile wide , you may well enjoy this . It would of course help if you've already seen some "" Krimis "" and know what to expect . .

Text2: What had drawn me to watch Death Defying Acts , is that it's a story with Harry Houdini , arguably the greatest illusionist and escape artist of our time . A few days ago I was browsing through a book which revealed the secrets behind his brand of death defying acts , and really he's a man of science , engineering and most of all , a performer to bring to life the act of fooling an audience into believing his stunts . Sure there's an element of danger , but with proper risk assessment and safeguards , they strip away all the mystique that serves to confound . But contrary to the title , there's nothing really death defying about the movie , as it treaded on safe ground and doesn't dwell any more on the illusions that it has to . In fact , you can count the number of stunts which involve Harry Houdini , and the filmmakers left that for another biographical movie that someone else should pick up on . What we have instead are glimpses into the man's personal life , and Guy Pearce provided quite an intense and charismatic Houdini with personal demons of his own to do battle with , though the story seemed to rein him in from dwelling too much on that aspect , and preferred to have a more romantic tale weaved in . The romanticism of the movie is not with his illusions , but with a single parent who's a psychic of sorts , relying on her street smarts to get her own act going . Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Mary McGarvie , who has to rely on her wits to build credibility for her stage character . Together with daughter and sidekick Benji ( played by Saoirse Ronan of Atonement fame ) , the mother and daughter team tries hard to make a living from their acts , but realize that they're by no means close to Houdini's widespread fame and fortune . However , Houdini himself throws a gauntlet to all psychics far and wide , that whosoever can accurately reveal what his late mother had last said to him , will inherit US$10 , 000 . His purpose it seems is to reveal that the majority of these soothsayers are tricksters in disguise , until of course he meets the luminous Mary , and affairs of the heart throws him off course . Naturally , Mary and Benji find themselves up against the best in the business , but when your back is against the wall , there's nothing much to lose it seems . As mentioned earlier , this movie's more of a character study of the master magician , and explores things like his guilt because of dedication to his craft and performance , as well as his questionable motives in being attracted to the fictional Mary McGarvie . Narrated by the character of Benji , we see things through a child's eyes , and perhaps therein lies the loss of some pathos in the romantic angle of it . On one hand , it isn't your classic romantic story , while on the other , it doesn't seem to want to preach the method , rationale and mindset of Houdini himself . So what emerged is a mixed bag . Beautifully shot , but again falling on the emptiness of its effort in trying to allow the audience to feel for the characters . At least Timothy Spall , who plays Mr Sugarman , Houdini's manager , allowed for some light moments as the guarded and wary person that he is . And credit goes to keeping the ending quite right too .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The only person who shouts is Jodie Foster , and then only to scream : "" WHERE'S MY BABY ? "" There's no musical score worth mentioning , but the incidental sounds - - Wow ! If a door aboard the airliner closes , or if a body falls softly to the carpeted deck , the action is accompanied by a loud WHOMP on the sound track , sometimes with a cowbell or two thrown in . And if somebody should be struck in the face by a small woman wielding a fire extinguisher , the sound rivals Krakatoa . Sometimes you get "" whomps "" for no reason at all except that there's a cut from one scene to another . The basis for all this , of course , is the disappearance of Jody Foster's daughter on an airplane flying from Munich to New York . There is no record of her having been aboard . No one has seen her , and so forth . The Captain searches the ship but never believes her . This is familiar territory for anyone who's seen Alfred Hitchcock's "" The Lady Vanishes . "" Hitchcock's effort was kind of rollicking fun , full of japes and wisecracks , sometimes outright silly . But it was fun . "" Flightplan "" begins along the same lines , but as a dramatic mystery . From there it turns into a "" woman in jep "" movie . And by the climax has reached the caligian depths of Your Standard Typical Action Movie , with a crazy hijacker pursuing a child-carrying Foster through the bowels of the giant airplane , which altogether seems about the size of the Vanderbilt House in North Carolina . And a darn good thing it is , too , that Foster should happen to be a propulsion engineer , because she knows her way around that monstrous crate to the extent that she can disable the plane without endangering the passengers . She has an awesome memory when you come right down to it . The interior of the avionics section looks like the inside of Hal's brain , yet she knows precisely which jack to pull out of which plug to cause the oxygen masks to pop out of their cabinets , and which lead to short out so the lights blow in the passenger cabins . Now that's saying a lot for a propulsion engineer , I would think , but I was glad anyway , because without that eidetic imagery she would have been even harder put to outwit the hijackers . ( Yes , there's a hijack plot , but it doesn't involve the Arabs aboard . They're nothing but red herrings , or red couscous . ) Knowing , as we do , that there are explosives aboard that can be detonated with the flick of a finger , we expect an explosion and we get it . ( So does the heavy . ) Foster The Child-Carrier , to give her a suitably Homeric epithet , manages to survive the gigantic blast and emerges from the smoke in slow motion and intact , to the awe and delight of the onlookers . Jody Foster is pretty good , as usual . She an accomplished actress . And she's finally beginning to look more mature than she did 36 years ago in "" Taxi Driver "" . Peter Sarsgaard is , regrettably , not a good heavy . He's not a heavy at all . He's somebody's reserved but sensible cousin or best friend , that's what he is . I mean , if the movie is going to go this cheap route , then please , for God's sake , spare us the complexity involved in matching Sarsgaard's benign presence with his role . ( He was a good maniac in "" Boys Don't Cry , "" though . ) There's a really enjoyable movie out there about the disappearance of a person from a moving vehicle . It doesn't involve an airplane though .

Text2: It's hard to believe this thing received so many positive comments from viewers . The performances struck me as adequate , but that was the only decent thing about it . The story sports more lacunae than a round of Emmenthaler cheese and has so many pointless asides that the narrative is almost impossible to follow and , when that's possible , it's impossible to believe it . I won't duplicate the comments that have already been made about this problem except to mention one that particularly grated on me . This secret assasin , the man of a thousand faces , the guy who's identity is so obscure that the FBI isn't even sure he exists , answers a ringing phone and says , "" Jackal . "" Zinneman's "" The Day of the Jackal "" was a finely tooled and highly logical piece of craftsmanship , as was Forsythe's novel before it . That earlier jackal carried only three identities and didn't change his hair style or color as often as he changed his socks , the way Willis does . "" The Jackal "" makes the earlier film look like a masterpiece of subtlety . Frederick Fox in the original lifts a man's passport at a ticket counter but you must watch closely to see it because it's done in an instant and with self-possessed skill . Here , Willis sits at an aiport for God knows how long until a man sitting nearby finally gets up and leaves his seat , leaving his open bag behind , as Willis must intuitively have known he would , which happens to have his passport sticking conveniently out so Willis can saunter over and pick it up . The tiny , easily broken-down , concealable , small caliber rifle with special bullets , in the original , here becomes gargantuized - - Gorgonized - - into a huge , complicated cannon firing ( what was it ? ) 1 , 000 rounds a minute ? ( Light machine guns fire about 500 rpm . ) Enough armament to stop a Banzai attack , and all for one little Hillary Clinton clone . ( Footnote : those especially lethal bullets in the original , which shattered the pumpkin's head , weren't infallible ; they were used in the attempted assasination of President Regan in 1982 . ) But even where the original was subtle , it was at least clear . When Fox sights his rifle in , we can watch him do it and easily understand how it's being done . Here , we see gears and knurled knobs clicking and whirring while Willis twirls a kind of wand and have no idea what's going on . We see a man blasted to bits by the cannon , but we do not see a demonstration after it has been properly sighted in . Instead of a long-distance duel between the bureaucracy and a clever murderer , we get two macho guys who wind up in a shoot out . I won't go on about this . The fact that it's a remake is symptomatic . Remakes have become endemic , like chicken pox in the middle ages . Why do they do it ? Why take something that is well done and simply redo it , either shot-by-shot or dumbed down ? Psycho , High Noon , The Thing - - all of them inferior copies of the originals . And the copies of TV series keep coming as well . The committees full of MBAs go on and on , driven ravenous by greed , snarling and grasping , hyenas fighting over carcasses . I keep waiting for "" Gone With the Wind , Part II . "" It seems only a matter of time - - and desperation . You want to see a nicely tooled machine ? Rent the original . If you want a better actioner than this , rerent "" The Terminator "" or any one of a hundred other flicks filled with big cannons and vehicular fireballs and shootouts in subways .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
824,"Text1: If PHFFFT had been made in the ' 30s or ' 40s , it would have been done with Cary Grant and Jean Arthur as the couple ( or Cary and Irene Dunne ) . But by 1954 , JUDY HOLLIDAY and JACK LEMMON were paired once again ( they starred previously in IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU ) , and proved to be a great comic team with perfect timing and good chemistry . As it is , the story is a throwback to the ' 30s and the kind of screwball comedies Grant usually did . George Axelrod's script is about a couple who decide that their married life has become a bore and impulsively seek a divorce . They then settle down to the business of finding another mate and discover that the single life is not exactly a bed of roses . Lemmon is matched with KIM NOVAK ( a blind date arranged by JACK Carson ) , and Novak gets a chance to glow as an airhead with a Marilyn Monroe air of winsome charm but ditsy manners . She tries hard , but the character seems forced and her attempt to play the simple minded glamor girl comes across as strained and awkward . But the show belongs to the shenanigans of Holliday and Lemon as they go through the paces of an amusing script with some laugh getting results . However , the material is thin and the ending is a rather predictable one with Judy successfully resisting the advances of JACK Carson and realizing who her own true love really is . Fans of Holliday and Lemmon should enjoy it , but Kim Novak still had a lot to learn .

Text2: One of the great injustices of Hollywood history is the fact that Deborah Kerr was nominated for Best Actress while Robert Mitchum got nary a mention for Best Actor in Heaven Knows , Mr . Allison . Kerr had several nominations , but never came up a winner . Mitchum was nominated once at the beginning of his career in the Best Supporting Actor category in The Story of GI Joe and then never again . In Mitchum's case I think that some of his irreverent comments offended a few people . Sometimes Bob was a bit too candid about what he thought of the film industry and his chosen profession . Otherwise he might well have gotten nominations for this , Night of the Hunter , Cape Fear , Ryan's Daughter , The Sundowners , The Friends of Eddie Coyle and a few others . This film is always and rightly compared to The African Queen with a female in the religious missionary profession and a hell-raising outsider thrown together in war time . The African Queen was in World War I and this film is set on a backwater Pacific island in World War II . Corporal Allison , USMC arrives on a rubber raft after the Japanese opened fire on a submarine he was on . The only other person on the island is a nun who has seen all the others die or flee the island . It's a small island , but apparently strategically located . The film is about these two mismatched people thrown together and what they have to do to survive . Deborah Kerr is a nun who hasn't yet taken her final vows and being alone on the island with Mitchum is a temptation no doubt . Mitchum though has his own code . He's a foundling kid who took the name of Allison because that was the street in Milwaukee he was dropped off on . He was a juvenile delinquent until he joined the Marines and they gave his life a meaning . The Marine Corps manual is his Bible as much as the Scripture is Kerr's . I can identify with that because in fact I had a cousin who was in the Marines who did in fact straighten him out . He was a hell raising kid in his youth and he became if not a solid citizen after his service , at least a respectable one . John Huston got unforgettable performances out of his credited cast of two . Heaven Knows , Mr . Allison has not dated one single bit since its release . We all need something to believe in to get us through in this world .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

It seems that when they bite someone else , that "" virus "" causes the one bitten to have the same symptoms , because the soldiers ' commanding officer Captain John Saxon ( bitten by Radice ) is developing the craving after taking a small bite out of an alluring female teen neighbor . I'll just be honest . . I know this flick has it's fans , but I thought it was crap . I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons ; I seriously giggled non stop at the crude vulgar dialogue nearly every character speaks , especially the police detective . There are some ridiculously over-the-top gore scenes which nearly had me rolling in the floor like when a demented Giovanni Lombardo Radice is sawing away at a gas station attendant's torso as he hits bone or when a certain character trying to flee police in the sewer ( . . guess who ? ) gets a complete hole blown through where his stomach once was . . replete with a camera shot through the hole as police come around the corner to see their handiwork as a glide up the body shows the dazed face of the now-dead character . Both shock sequences are pretty impressive , though . And , Radice really "" gets into character "" , saddled with some hilarious rubbish dialogue and his co-hort Tony King REALLY has a field day with his deranged Vietnam crazy who just loves leaving violent carnage in his wake . Liz Turner is John Saxon's concerned . . yet also terrified . . wife who worries about her husband's well-being and mental state . The conclusion is grim , to say the least . If you rent the DVD from netflix , I highly recommend watching the documentary with interviews by Saxon , director Antonio Margheriti , and ESPECIALLY Radice whose very candid and quite funny . Saxon says he didn't know that this film would feature flesh eating and Radice denounces his later film with Umberto Lenzi , "" Cannibal ferox . "" Director Antonio Margheriti did what he could , I guess , with the material he's stuck with . Radice says that he didn't take the material too seriously , which is probably good .

Text2: A group of bank robbing murdering thugs hole up at the Hollister farmhouse embedded within massively long corn rows . William ( Henry Thomas ) was given directions to this place by a dying Confederate soldier named Jeffy who was is love with Annabelle ( Nicki Aycox ) . . Annabelle , however , was always in love with William . Along with his brother Sam ( Patrick Fugit ) , Annabelle , former black slave Todd ( Isaiah Washington ) , portly Joseph ( Mark Boone Junior ) , and sneaky , untrustworthy Clyde ( Michael Shannon ) they murder everyone within a bank as soldiers planned to store their gold in it . William , as they were fleeing the scene of the crime in a gun battle with other soldiers , actually shoots a boy . When they approach the rows leading to the plantation , the group encounters an eye-less , pale skinned monstrosity for which is gunned down immediately . This perhaps was their warning to stay away . . not heeding to it would be their downfall . It's quite clear upon staying within the farmhouse that something's amiss . . there's an atmosphere of doom surrounding this that slowly releases it's secrets . Sam received a nasty gunshot wound that seems infected to the point where it threatens his life , but that is just a taste of what awaits them . Weird noises and the sight of demonic children ( . . with Todd later seeing the ghost of a slave gutted ) awaken a fear in each member of the group as supernatural forces show themselves as they fall to the evils one at a time . Through the dying Sam , the farmer Hollister ( Muse Watson ) reveals himself and his past actions regarding his possessed children , his dead wife , the slaves he sacrificed , and his lynching by the neighbors surrounding the farmhouse . Sam passes this knowledge to Annabelle before he's dead . We get an understanding that the farmhouse and it's surrounding rows is cursed . . anyone who decides to enter in suffer for it , never to escape . Southern Gothic creeper , really has a sense of dread that builds thanks to a marvelously spooky setting . The film has lots of moments concerning the evils which provoke the cast that works well at getting under the skin . And , the unique story-telling regarding the plight of the characters , who are indeed unpleasant , greedy murderers is well told I thought . Using voodoo or whatever it was that was written within the torn book Todd was reading lets the film go into some thrilling areas particularly concerning the children and what they turn into . Plus , the filmmakers take every opportunity to throw up a scare concerning the characters who leave the film in one way or another such as Joseph being pulled into the well by something after hearing the frightened voice of a girl who needed help or Clyde who had been stuffed with straw , his eyes , nose & mouth tied with twine , and hung on a stick to resemble a scarecrow . Todd's exit is particularly weird . A unique , somewhat original horror tale . . it's more about execution ( how it builds tension within that creepy farmhouse and it's old rooms containing some disturbing history ) than the story , though . Oh , look fast when William is running up the stairs to find Clyde and you'll see the his "" demonic "" reflection come across the window .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Roddy Piper , the WWF wrestler , plays a drifter who stumbles upon a huge secret : the powerful elite on Earth are really aliens who exploit the working man . They are disguised as people , but with a pair of special sunglasses , he can see which ones are which . Without a second's worth of questioning , he grabs a shotgun and starts blasting away at every one of the ugly s . o . b . ' s . It's silly , but entertainingly so .

By the time Piper starts to see the aliens , I was the only person of four watching it left awake .

Text2: I don't know why I enjoy this movie as much as I do . I haven't cared about baseball much since I was ten years old . This isn't Redford's best performance by any means . The story is an ur-sports one . Act One : Prodigy is discovered . Act Two : Tragedy leads to slump . Act Three : Protagonist overcomes demons and wins the game ( or bout , or chukkar , or whatever ) . Subordinate characters are largely stereotypes . There is an overobvious mythological overlay that's more pretentious than anything else . During dramatic moments , the score swells to heroic proportions to an extent that we almost expect a cut to Moses's parting of the Red Sea . The slow-motion not only signals a triumph in the making but allows us to relish it for a few seconds longer . Let's see . I guess that about covers most of the reasons not to like the film . But these flaws are pretty much overcome by its virtues . When the score isn't elevating us to the status of worshipers it has a nice period slangy feel to it . During the periods of defeat the score never becomes maudlin . It retains a kind of tinkly offhand quality but sounds a bit slower in tempo , imbued with a hardly noticeable melancholy . The photography is first rate . It has the same tawny quality that has cropped up in lesser works like "" The Fortune "" or "" W . C . Fields and Me . "" Everyone seems burnished by the sun . And the period detail is evocative without being obtrusive . A slow-motion shot of a dying flashbulb signals the beginning of Redford's career slump . The light-bulb-as-career works well , as it did for Scorcese and for Orson Welles in "" Citizen Kane . "" The story follows the three-act pattern , except that it doubles it by giving us two tragedies instead of one , so you get twice as much for your money , and Hobbs has double the number of demons to cope with . ( First he gets shot - - in a theme I must say I didn't completely understand - - then he falls for Lillith instead of whoever the muse of the game of baseball is . ) The acting ? As I say , Redford in the central role is a bit too minimalized , or maybe it's the wrong kind of role for him , although he looks the part of the fit athlete perfectly - - sinuously muscled instead of bulging all over with sarcomeres . Of course his background in baseball must have helped his physical performance . He looks right . I wish he had projected a little more concern about his slump . He's pretty casual about the whole thing . Glenn Close is good , as usual , although surely such companions don't exist . Kim Basinger looks ravishing . Duval turns in his usual superior performance , laughing , smiling , his mouth open , villainous . The other players are equally good , locked as they are into one-dimensional roles . I particularly enjoy the pizazz that Darren McGavin brings to his part of the antagonistic gambler . It's his best role in years . He's philosophical about losing , charming , full of casual jokes . The restaurant scene in which he pops out his eye is amusing and slightly frightening at the same time . The judge , despite his greed and underhandedness , is amusing too . He speaks in the pompous Gongoristic prose you'd expect from someone who used to sit on the bench and is accustomed to demonstrating how superior he is to most mortals . "" A canard - - a pure canard . "" Brimley and Farnsworth are a pair of aces as they try to deal with the newly arrived middle-aged rookie , or sit together on the bench while each tries to name the song the other is humming . ( This was a touch added by Levinson when he noticed the two of them doing it between takes . ) Yes , it has all those weaknesses . But it's the kind of movie that doesn't repay much analysis .

But this time he's killing Jamaican drug dealers because they've marked him for death . He teams up with his old army buddy Keith David and takes on an entire army of them . Like you do . The action is affective and does excite but the rest of the movie doesn't generate much interest and leads us to believe that a lot of scenes were dropped . This could explain some of the confusion and plot holes ( we are told Screwface is so-called for a reason , which is never given ) and the trailer and R2 DVD cover features scenes and stills that are nowhere to be seen in the film . This movie injects a theme of voodoo that got me excited at first but disappointed me when nothing happens with it . Joanna Pacula is in the movie for about a minute but gets second billing on the cast list . Oh , it also has a bizarre plot twist that I won't ruin for you . Fox's DVD is not up to scratch . The 2 . 35 : 1 picture is not anamorphic and is troublesome . Very poor blacks and badly contrasted scenes mar the film . As I have said , upon viewing the theatrical trailer and spying the cover of the R2 release I can spot at least 2 deleted scenes . The insert card only lists half of the chapter stops the DVD has ( apparently the film ends at chapter 10 ) . The insert card also displays a picture from Under Siege 2 ( which is not even owned by Fox , but Warner ) . And if you think that is bad then wait for this . . . the back cover claims the DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 ( it's not ) and displays a picture from the 007 movie License to Kill ( which is owned by MGM ! ) . I can't imagine how that got in there but I have a good feeling Fox will re-release this in anamorphic and DTS sound . They did this with the Die Hard Trilogy , Predator and The Siege . Hopefully these errors will be corrected when they do so . Even if the sole extra is still the theatrical trailer I would still by re-release of M4D . The car chase and final rumble are way cool scenes and James Newton Howard's score is very cool indeed . I would only buy this for cheap as I am 99 % sure that Fox will re-release it .

833,"Text1: An obnoxious girl , unable to find joy in her life , is sent by an elderly fairy into the Lands of the Past & the Future to seek for THE BLUE BIRD of Happiness . Her search will change her life profoundly . . . Fantasy is the most difficult genre for film to create successfully . All the elements have to come together just right , and then , more often than not , success is a happy accident . Fantasy is not replicable ; note the number of failed sequels . If 20th Century Fox was trying to emulate MGM's THE WIZARD OF OZ ( an initial box office flop , it should be remembered ) , it was not a wise endeavor . Given its troubled production history , OZ should have been a disaster . That it was not still puzzles & delights film historians . THE BLUE BIRD's ultimate failure is not complete . There are several very good things about it . The main trouble seems to be in the casting of Shirley Temple in the lead role . The greatest child star of them all was now aging , and prepubescent Shirley seems to depend a bit too much on the gracious memories of her devotees . She's still cute , but this time that's just not enough . Also , it must have been awkward acting such a nasty role , one doomed to be disliked by the audience for much of the film . Gale Sondergaard , as the Cat , has much the same problem . She tries hard , but the role is very unsympathetic & we are never told why her character is so wicked - indeed , capable of murder . It's interesting to note that both Temple & Sondergaard were important contenders for major roles in OZ , but were instead rejected for Judy Garland & Margaret Hamilton . There are several cast members that do an excellent job with their material : Spring Byington , tender as Shirley's mother ; wonderful old Jessie Ralph as the fairy ; Eddie Collins , often very funny as the Dog ; Nigel Bruce & Laura Hope Crews , giving ripe performances as Mister & Mrs . Luxury ; and dear Cecilia Loftus & Al Shean as Shirley's lonely , dead grandparents . Some of the minor casting is also very effective , witness Thurston Hall as Father Time , Edwin Maxwell as Old Man Oak & Sterling Holloway , on screen only a few seconds as Wild Plum . That's Scotty Beckett , from the old OUR GANG Comedies , as one of the Unborn Boys . The use of Technicolor is very eye-appealing , although its initial entry into the film lacks the dramatic punch produced in OZ . The forest firestorm sequence is very well done & the Unborn Children scenes have genuine pathos .

This POW Camp was located in Changi in Singpore and was not a prison with large fences , because the prisoners were surrounded by water and a jungle . The officers had huts made of straw and this was considered a hell hole of a place where you went to bed in sweat and woke up in sweat with plenty of flies to keep you company .

Text2: After the financial flopping of THE CRUSADES , Cecil B . DeMille concentrated on films dealing with different aspects of American history from 1760 to 1942 . THE PLAINSMAN dealt with Wild Bill Hickok , Buffalo Bill , Calamity Jane , and even Custer . THE BUCCANEER dealt with the Battle of New Orleans , Jean Lafitte , and General Andy Jackson . UNION PACIFIC dealt with the transcontinental railroad ( no really historic figure dominated the story here ) . Then came an exception to this trend , when DeMille turned to the Mounties v . Louis Riel in Manitoba in NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE . But he returned to the American History with REAP THE WILD WIND . The final two films were THE STORY OF DOCTOR WADDELL ( DeMille's only World War II film , oddly enough ) , and THE UNCONQUERED ( his only pre - 19th Century American history film ) . REAP THE WILD WIND , at first sight , does not quite seem as understandable as the others . THE PLAINSMAN is about the threat to the frontier of the Indians ( getting modern weapons via villainous Charles Bickford ) . THE BUCCANEER does deal with how Jackson and Lafitte won the defining victory of the War of 1812 , and saved the Mississippi Valley . UNION PACIFIC was how , despite crooks like Brian Donleavy , the great railroad united the U . S . with a backbone of steel . Even NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE explained why there were two nations going west to the Pacific , not three ( the third made of Frenchmen and Metis and Indians ) . But REAP THE WILD WIND did not deal with westward expansion , or with land . It dealt with the America's other 19th Century frontier : the seas . We don't think of it ( outside , perhaps , of New England ) , but from 1800 to 1865 our merchant marine was quite vigorous . Confederate raiders like C . S . S . Alabama destroyed much of it , but until that we were giving Great Britain serious competition . But the background of REAP THE WILD WIND is actually a little out of date in the film . The story takes place in 1840 or so . It should be in the 1820s to early 1830s . When Great Britain ceased being our rulers , our merchant ships suddenly were targeted by various predators . The best known was the Barbary Pirates ( with whom we had two wars in 1804 and 1815 ) . But in the Caribbean a number of freebooters and pirates sprung up to ravage our struggling merchant ships . Indeed , Jean Lafitte and his brother were suspected ( possibly unfairly ) of being among these - more likely the Lafittes were simply smugglers . In the late 1820s , Captain David Porter was sent with a small flotilla to clean out the worst pirate stations in the Caribbean . He did a good job . Actually , by 1840 our navy was doing a fine job protecting our ships . But for some reason DeMille moved the story into the 1840s . It does not hurt the film , but it weakens it's historical accuracy . Ray Milland represents a wealthy ship owner ( Walter Hampden ) whose ships are being lost to wreckers in a gang headed by Raymond Massey . Hampden's chief ship captain is John Wayne . As the film progresses he and Milland become rivals for Paulette Goddard . Her sister , Susan Hayward , becomes enamored with Massey's younger brother Robert Preston . Massey is not too keen on this , except if it gets him additional information of the movement of Hampden's ships . On the other hand , he uses the Wayne - Milland rivalry to get control ( of a sort ) over Wayne . A shipwreck of the flagship of Hampden's line results , and this leads to Milland's attempts to bring Massey to book in court . But the latter is extremely clever , and he suggests that Milland's behavior may have led to the disaster . The court decides they need further evidence - and this leads to testing the testimony of a slave , who claims the ship was haunted , and there was a noisy ghost in the hold . Is it so , or was there a stowaway - possibly the missing Susan Hayward . The conclusion , with three of the leads drowned or shot down on deck and Paulette Goddard averring that this was all her fault reminds one of the conclusion of say HAMLET , with corpses littering the stage . De Mille never tried that conclusion again , but it was a curious ending . It is also odd seeing Wayne ( on his way to super-stardom after STAGECOACH , THE LONG VOYAGE HOME , and DARK COMMAND ) in a supporting role , as was Hayward . Yet a decade later , when it was re-released , they got top billing over the actual stars Milland and Goddard .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
837,"Text1: Mark Twain was a man who sometimes could not get a notion out of his head . He loved the issue of twins and switching births . It pervades much of his fiction , and few seem to comment on it . In one of his early sketches he tells an inquisitive reporter that the tragedy of his life was the strange death of his twin - the boy had one only one mark on his body that differs him from his brother - Twain shows it to the reporter on his own person , and says that was the boy who supposedly died mysteriously and was buried . The reporter leaves after that tidbit . Of course the novel ( which became the subject of this film and several others ) is the one that people think of as Twain's "" twins switching "" story . It isn't . He would write ( in the 1880s ) a piece called "" Those Amazing Twins "" about a pair of Italian Siamese twins . The piece ( which is not one of his best ) became part of the germination that led to his last great Mississippi novel "" Pudd'nhead Wilson "" . He separates the twin Italians into two twin brother Italian counts who turn up in the Mississippi town where the action goes . He also takes the "" switched at birth "" motif and uses it in the main story of Chambers the slave switched by his mother Roxey with young Tom Driscoll the wealthy heir . Twins pop up too in "" Tom Sawyer Detective "" - which was based on an old 17th Century Danish murder case involving twins . But it's "" The Prince And The Pauper "" ( 1876 ) that is recalled as Twain's "" twin story "" . I think it's because the other pieces are minor or ( like Wilson ) full of other interesting small matters - like the business of the use of fingerprints to settle the mysteries of the plot ( a first in 1894 ) . Here it is central to Twain's looking at an appalling , inequitable social system in Tudor England . Henry VIII is dying and his son Edward , Prince of Wales is aware that he is going to soon lose his wise father and take over the reins of government . Of course the truth is he is still too young ( in 1547 he is only 11 ) and he really can only rule in his own right when he reaches adult age ( presumably 21 ) . He will need a "" Protector "" and the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Herford are the leading contenders . In the film wise old Henry Stephenson is Norfolk and crafty , power-seeking Claude Rains is Hertford . Henry ( Montague Love ) appoints both to the governing counsel , but does not name Norfolk over Hertford ( or the reverse ) . So Rains starts jockeying for position in a confrontation with England's premier Duke . In reality it was more complicated . Norfolk was on the outs with Henry in 1547 ( he was facing execution - his son the Earl of Surrey was executed the year before - but Henry's own death saved Norfolk ) . The two contenders were the Duke of Somerset ( Edward Seymour ) , blood uncle to Edward VI through his mother , and John Dudley , Duke of Northumberland , who dreamed of placing the Dudley family and the Tudors permanently together by marrying the three Tudor heiresses , Princesses Mary and Elizabeth , and Lady Jane Grey , to his sons . One day this plan would blow up in his face ( see TUDOR ROSE ) . Somerset's doom was tied to a similar hair-brained scheme of his brother Admiral Sir Thomas Seymour regarding marrying Princess Elizabeth ( see YOUNG BESS ) . Edward , in Twain's story , while waiting for the sad news , meets Tom Canty , a boy who looks almost exactly like him ( here played - for a change - by the Mauch Twins ) . As a lark they change clothes so each can see how the other half live . Tom is soon over his head , causing his cousin Jane to question his sanity , and revealing enough to Hertford to realize that the false-King is his own key to power . Edward is unfortunately forced to endure the poverty of Tom's social class , but also the brutality of Tom's father John Canty ( Barton McLaine ) who is a professional thief . But Edward is soon helped by a young squire , Miles Herndon ( Errol Flynn ) who is trying to return to his ancestral home to regain his possessions from a greedy brother . The twisty plot did show much of the underside of English Tudor living that many of the other early Tudor history films barely touched on ( except to show the intrigues at court ) . It also had plenty of humor - look at the business about the usefulness of "" the Great Seal of England "" , which is typical Twain humor . I feel this version of the story is quite good - possibly the best of the different versions of the novel that have reached the screen .

Text2: James Thurber wrote the short story , "" THE GREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD "" in the early 1930s , and it still has a tremendously effective kick to this day . Basically the story deals with the following problem : what happens when the man who is a hero turns out not to have the right character ? I don't think Thurber was aiming any particular darts at Lindbergh , who was made into a national God in 1927 by his act of bravery in flying the Atlantic alone and successfully between New York and Paris . Lindbergh's later pro-Nazi point of view was not known in 1931 . Instead , Thurber was basing his story on the following . Whatever defects Lindberg , or polar explorer Richard Byrd , or other notable heroes of the day had these defects were well hidden , or of a relatively trifling nature ( i . e . , Byrd's drinking ) , that the public could just admire their outward manifestations of courage , chivalry , modesty , friendliness , etc . But this could not always be guaranteed for all people who made great achievements . In this tale , Jimmy Schmurch ( renamed Smidgeon here - Reed Birney plays him ) is a daredevil who pilots a juiced-up airplane using an engine designed by a madman ( Russell Horton ) , to fly non-stop around the globe . When the plane lands , Smidgeon is exhausted and collapses . He is taken to a hospital to recuperate . In the meantime a newspaper editor ( Howard De Silva ) , has sent his reporter out to find background on the incapacitated hero . The reporter discovers that Smidgeon is an abusive , nasty individual - a heavy drinker - who has had more adulterous affairs than one can shake a stick at . He also is a close friend of bootleggers ( the story is set in the Prohibition period ) , and his mother and family have had plenty of run-ins with the law . De Silva realizes that the public can't have a hero like this . He informs the government , so that the Secretary of State ( William Prince ) is put in charge . Due to the national prestige involved , Prince puts it succinctly : "" This is the biggest national crisis since the sinking of the Lusitania "" ) . Unfortunately , the idiot reporter is one of those idealists who feel that if the public knows everything , everything will work out right . Despite De Silva's well-meant warnings to let wiser people handle this , the reporter decides to got to poor Jack Smidgeon . Smidgeon has actually recovered ( he only needed a night or two of sleep ) and he now wants to get some booze and to get his main squeeze into bed . Leading the idiot reporter on , the latter gets him out of the hospital to a car hoping to have the interview of his career . Instead Smidgeon knocks him out and takes off . The reporter is subsequently fired for his stupidity . Smidgeon is captured and brought back . He is told that there will be a meeting he must attend . He goes to a room full of political bigwigs , including the President . They are lecturing him on how he will act from now on . Smidgeon sneers - he knows the power of his position . They want him to keep quiet and behave ? Well , it could be arranged , if they pay him big money . How the crisis is finally resolved is the final irony of this wonderful story . This was one of a series of dramatizations of short stories by American Authors that were made in the early 1980s . They were shown on Channel 13 . As far as I know they have not been shown in the quarter century since then . Pity , because most of them were quite good . Maybe one day they will be revived .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
838,"Text1: Many celebrities don't know their limitations . Once , Jean-Claude Van Damme just thought he could act . This film marks the first time he believed himself to be able to direct , too . Luckily , he didn't do so again for a decade . . . with some luck , he'll either be prohibited from further attempts at the ( admittedly tough ) art of directing after his next effort , or have learned a thing or two since he made this . I'm holding out more hope for the first , to be honest . I suppose , if one were so inclined ( personally , I have no interest in liquor ) , one could play a drinking game with watching this movie . . . but there certainly are other pieces of cinematic entertainment that are easier to sit through , and which would do the job for that just as well . The plot plods along , never really holding your interest ( or even getting it in the first place ) . The pacing is among the closest to non-existent in any film I've ever seen . The acting . . . well , the less said about it , the better . The children in the first few scenes give in better performances than the actual names on the film ( and believe me , that says a lot ) . The score is nothing worth mentioning . The writing is all rather poor . There is but one reason to watch this movie . . . and it's the fight scenes . Seriously , any martial arts fan should watch this for that one reason at least once in his life-time . So many styles of professional fighting represented . If the idea of watching a tournament right out of the Tekken games appeals to you , give the last third of this film a chance . About half an hour of this movie is non-stop fighting . Once it finally gets to it , it hardly ever stops to take a breather . For any other Tekken ( well , from the third game and onward ) fans out there , the fighting style of one of my personal favorites is featured . . . Eddy . Something that especially makes the fights exciting and entertaining is the unpredictability factor . . . while , admittedly , you kind of know who the ultimate winner will be , and who his main opponent will be ( this is Hollywood-ish action , after all . . . can't break formula ) , the majority of the fights , due to the fighters only being that ( none of them are really developed as characters ( not that that's all that different from the level of back-story and development of the actual characters , but still ) ) . They're possible opponents for our lead . Few of them are made out to be definite winners or losers . Think of it as the surprise level of the first Paul W . S . Anderson film you watch . . . only , you know , good . That is the one aspect of the film that makes it watchable . Well , that and it's good for a laugh ( but there are other , less painful films to watch that provide the same ) . I recommend this only to huge fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme and martial arts .

Text2: I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews , I was looking forward to it . After seeing it , I realized what people were excited about , it was Clint's performance , this is a man you do not want to mess with . He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance . I love his growls , he sounds like a great guard dog , I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise . I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is : he's a writer , director , and an actor , not to mention that he's great at all three of them . He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down , he's truly a good man . Walt Kowalski , a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran , lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants . At the start of the movie , Walt is attending his wife's funeral , bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich . Similarly , he has little patience with his two sons , Mitch and Steve , and their families , who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother . Walt's sons see him as "" always disappointed "" with them and their families , unaware of their obnoxiousness . Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors , a shy Thao Vang Lor and his feisty sister Sue , live with their widowed mother and grandmother . The Hmong gang , at that point , tries to persuade Thao to join them . Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car , a 1972 Gran Torino Sport . Walt interrupts the robbery , pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee . After a few days , Spider and his gang return . With Sue at his side , Thao manages to verbally confront them to no avail . The gang drags Thao off his porch in an attempt to assault him . His family tries desperately to fend off Spider and his cohorts . The conflict ends when Walt , who fought in the United States Army's 1st Cavalry Division , threatens the gang members with his M1 Garand rifle and orders them to get off his lawn . They leave the neighborhood , telling Walt to watch his back . After seeing Sue being harassed by three black teenagers , while her "" date "" cannot help her , Walt steps in to rescue her , confronting the teenagers and threatening them with a pistol . Sue gets to know Walt , and invites him to a family barbecue on his birthday , bringing him closer to her family , explaining Hmong culture and that during the Vietnam War they fought on "" his "" side . Sue , Thao , and their mother visit Walt the next day , with Thao's family forcing him to work for Walt for a week to atone for his attempted theft of the Gran Torino . Walt has Thao clean up the neighborhood until his debt is paid and shows Thao the ways of American men . Meanwhile , the Hmong gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them . But when he refuses , the Hmong gang goes too far in getting their revenge leading to Walt wanting more than punishment , he wants justice . I highly recommend Gran Torino if you get the chance to see it , it has terrific performances and a touching story . I'm really surprised that Clint didn't get more recognition for his strength in Walt , he became that character and I loved how he protected the family that he once hated . It was wonderful to see all these characters develop and grow together , they had great chemistry and made this movie into a great one . I think down the line , Gran Torino is going to be considered a classic , this is a terrific movie and deserves it's praise .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
839,"Text1: ' Le Hasard Fait Bien Les Choses ' ( AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT ) is a thoroughly surprising film . The marketing ploy makes this very well written ( Julie Gilbert and Philippe Le Dem ) and well directed ( Lorenzo Gabriele ) seem to be something it is not - a flashy fleshy gay flick from France . But what the viewer discovers soon after the film begins is a very tender story about the conflicts older gay men face in attempting to manage professional lives with personal lives . Jean-Pierre Muller ( the gifted Jean-Claude Brialy ) is a highly respected professor in his late 50s who is about to be honored for his achievements in teaching by the University . He is a proper gentleman and kind human being who hides his personal life : he is gay and has a quasi live-in lover Armando ( Antonio Interlandi ) in a very successful though closeted relationship for appearance's sake ( even his longtime housekeeper Ana - Elena Noverraz - apparently doesn't know ) ! All is smooth until a handsome young lad Antoine ( Julien Bravo ) is put before the court system as a minor who has lost his parents and needs an assigned guardian . In a strange law the judge ( Anne Kreis ) selects a random name ( Jean-Pierre , of course ) to be the guardian . Though Jean-Pierre is reluctant to accept guardianship for the somewhat feisty lad ( who is encouraged by his girlfriend Samantha - Lorriane Cherpillod - to try to get some cash from the court order ) , he discovers that he cannot appeal the decision for three months time . Desperate to continue his progress towards his desired honorary degree AND to keep his sexuality secret form the courts fearing they may hamper his chances , Jean-Pierre calls his ' arranged wife ' Alice ( Sabine Haudepin ) , whom he married to aid Alice's immigration status years ago , to be his ' front ' . Alice , just dumped by her lover Grégoire ( Juan-Antonio Crespillo ) agrees , moves in much to Armando's chagrin , and the facade is in place . What occurs in this ' arrangement ' is the resolution of each of the individual components in a manner that shows us that dignity , love , self-respect , and honesty are infectious and benefit all of us . The cast is uniformly excellent without a weak link . Jean-Claude Brialy is superb as the self-conscious but loving centerpiece , and the air of comedy and sensitivity conveyed by Sabine Haudepin , Antonio Interlandi , Elena Noverraz , newcomer and very promising Julien Bravo , and Anne Kreis are pitch perfect without ever stooping to stereotypes . This is a film for both gay and straight audiences who appreciate the manifestations of love , healthy relationships , caring , social problems , and understanding would enjoy . In French with English subtitles and unfortunately no extras on the DVD . Recommended . Grady Harp

Text2: HUEVOS DE ORO ( Golden Balls ) is a 1993 film by writer / director JJ Bigas Luna ( best known for his ' Jamon , Jamon ' and ' Son de Mar ' ) that suffers from defective promo / packaging . The cover of the DVD ( probably released only of late because of Javier Bardem's growing popularity in this country ) suggests an edgy comedy : Bardem in a gold suit is seen grasping his crotch ! Nothing could be more misrepresenting as this is a drama of lust , greed , power , and ruthlessness . Get past the promo and settle in for a drama and the result is not bad . Benito Gonzalez ( Javier Bardem ) is a construction worker with a dream : he is obsessed with power of building and owning the tallest building in Barcelona and of becoming the richest man who can own gold Rolex watches and have all the women he wants . He is a lustful lover , first with his best friend Mosca's ( Francesco Dominedo ) sister Rita ( Elisa Tovati ) whose body and scent are a passion for him . Yet he dreams of his tallest building ( the possibility of his achieving this is not unlike the ease of getting an erection ! ) and he focuses his life on his greed . His co-worker Miguel ( Alessandro Gassman ) is to help him fulfill his dream , but when he discovers Miguel is sleeping with Rita he is incensed and leaves his lowly construction job for the promise of riches in Barcelona . Through stepping on people , using devious means to get backing and money for his ' Gonzalez Tower ' , Benito gradually destroys all of those who want to help him - his new girl Claudia ( Maribel Verdu ) with whom he has another sexual obsession then talks into sleeping with one of his money source prospects , the banker ( Albert Vidal ) who has slept with Claudia becomes his father-in-law when for monetary gain Benito marries daughter Marta ( Maria de Medeiros ) , a wily but wealthy film producer ' Gil with the Chickpeas ' ( Ángel de Andrés López ) , and more . By breaking the law , abusing his ' friends ' , and lying in general Benito's building is nearly completed . But a series of tragedies involving Mosca's accidental death , and an auto accident with many permutations for Benito , and the ultimate loss of funding result in Benito's multiple losses of his dreams , betrayals of his pitiful sex life ( this time a lowly gardener Bob ( Benicio Del Toro ) steals his paramour ) leave Benito destroyed . The story is actually on the order of a Greek tragedy - but sadly without the impact . Though Javier Bardem is a brilliant actor and is in the company of other exceptional actors , the script by JJ Bigas Luna is weak , paying little attention to character motivation and emphasizing instead gross caricatures . But if the film is taken as a recreation of the driving , greedy , power obsession of the 1980s then the message makes its impact . And it is always good to see early work by such actors as Bardem , Del Toro , and Verdu ! Grady Harp","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Tom ( Tam in the book - played by Matthew Beard ) is a disillusioned young lad , living in a broken home in Yorkshire England , and in need of finding meaning to his brittle life . He happens upon a relic of a structure where he encounters a dog and a ' bag lady ' , and also the entry port to a trip to the past ! Time traveling to WW II he lands in London during the blitz attacks , befriends a young girl named May ( Charlotte Wakefield ) and then time travels back to the present where he encounters disbelief in his adventure . He feels he must return to the past to save May from an impending doom and in his attempts in doing so he comes to learn much about life , death , devotion , promises , and the effects of the passage of time . The actors are exceptional , both Beard and Wakefield as children but also Tom Wilkinson and Anna Massey in roles as adults whose participation in Tom's plight are deeply touching . The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and the pacing of the direction is excellent . Stories such as this require a certain amount of fantasy participation in order to be effective , and this is where Cokeliss shines . He does not allow the sentiment to become cloying and he maintains enough reality checks between the adults and the children to make us believe in angels a bit . It is a sweet film , very well made , and worth the viewer's time with its important message . Grady Harp

Text2: ON GOLDEN POND may be twenty-five years old but the film is of such high quality that it has retained the luminous quality that garnered so many awards when released . It not only has a fine script adapted by the playwright Ernest Thompson from his own play , but it benefits from the sensitive direction by Mark Rydell and a cast of superb actors . The story is rather simple : Ethel ( Katherine Hepburn ) and Norman ( Henry Fonda ) Thayer have returned to their summer home beside Golden Pond and while they are elderly , their lives are still significant . They receive a rare visit from their distant daughter Chelsea ( Jane Fonda ) who stops by with her current boyfriend Bill ( Dabney Coleman ) to drop off Bill's ruffian teenage son Billy ( Doug McKeon ) to reluctantly stay with them while Chelsea and Bill are off to Europe . It is a battle of age differences : Billy sees no future in starting a relationship with the old turkeys and Norman is resentful at the youth's attitude ( Ethel is the wise mediator ) . Slowly but surely the three bond , age differences diminish as negatives and Billy sees Norman as a wise teacher he has never had . Chelsea returns at summer's end with her now husband Bill and faces confrontation with Norman for never being the father she needed : Chelsea knows Norman has spent his life rejecting her because she was not the ' son ' he wanted ! Finally the family reconciles past differences and Ethel and Thayer face their aging and its effects as they listen to the loons on the lake . Hepburn , both Fondas , Coleman and McKeon give outstanding performances , but it is the knowledge that this was H . Fonda's last film and for all intents and purposes Hepburn's last film AND the only time the Fonda father / daughter team acted together on the screen that makes the film even more meaningful . The awards were many and well deserved , not only for the picture , but also for the actors and the production crew .

The movie could had really used some more action and better villainous characters , to make the movie more exciting , tense and entertaining to watch . There really isn't much happening in this movie , which seems odd , considering the genre of the movie and its story . The movie makes a redundant and pointless impression because of that . Even though the story sounds like it - this just isn't a fun or adventurous must-see . The movie is a bit clumsy looking at times . Though its production values are good and the actors do their best , the movie just isn't good enough to watch at times . The movie was obviously shot with only one camera , with as a result some silly and ineffective camera positions at times . It especially makes the more fast paced and action sequences look ridicules and ineffective . The movie uses some beautiful locations and is obviously shot really in Egypt itself , for most part . It uplifts the movie and gives it a certain extra sense of feeling of traveling , adventure and mystery . Too bad that the movie doesn't know how to fully exploit and use this feeling and atmosphere . It once again shows why Robert Pirosh wasn't the greatest director around . Considering its potential , it's a disappointing movie that in its core still brings some good entertainment . So not a completely unwatchable movie , even though it probably has more weak than strong points in it .

The only problem with Poppy is that she is self-centered and very critical of Liz's physical appearances . I think the scene with Liz's surgery proves that Poppy's not all that she seems to be . Poppy's true side showed during Liz's surgery when she tried to do more than Liz's asked her to do . Anyway , you can tell the disapproval on nurse Linda's face and the doctors during the surgery .

843,"Text1: Sent to Africa to make the next Mondo Cane movie the film makers found themselves in the middle of several revolutions . What they would film would form the basis of a damning attack on everyone , both black and white , involved in the shift in power on the Dark Continent . I've watched the three versions of this film and I'm a fan of all of them . Interestingly the one I like the least is the original cut of the film which has several snide comments and re-dubbed voices that make the film truly rude and cruel for no good reason . The original cut goes out of its way to have a holier than thou view that is missing from both of the English cuts . The original cut also has several more minutes of animal cruelty that is completely uncalled for . This film ran into serious trouble upon its original release because charges were brought , though later found to be false , that the film makers had paid some of the soldiers to kill some one so that they could film it . ( this charge would form the basis for The Wild Eye , a fictional film about the making of a mondo movie made by another Mondo Cane director ) Considering all of the the death and destruction in this film I find it hard to believe that anyone would have had to have been paid to kill anyone . Yes , its a tough film , but it leaves no one with clean hands , even the film makers . See this film . It will make you think .

844,"Text1: As everyone and his Uncle Max knows Hollywood is run by accountants rather than creators so it's ironic to discover that accountants can't count ; having changed the title of Agatha Christie's novel from Ten Little Indians ( which was itself a subtle change from Christie's original Ten Little Ns ) to And Then There Were None and having changed the title figured why not change the ending as well so that now the correct title should read And Then There Were Two . Christie went to great pains to construct a plot in which all the ten people on a small , uninhabited island , died one by one leaving no one alive and a ' solution ' in the form of a suicide note written by the murderer before taking his own life . It was , of course , as improbable as any of the ' locked door ' mysteries penned by Christie herself and / or any of her rivals in the genre but improbable is not quite the same as not technically feasible but since when has Hollywood left a novel / play , etc unmolested . If you answered ' never ' you're close . So , not content with changing the names of some of the characters they also throw in a happy ending in which the two survivors are not only the two youngest members of the group and one of each sex but are also implicitly bound for the altar . That being said Rene Clair makes a decent enough fist of this , the seventh and last of the films he made outside his native France in a roughly ten-year period . Perhaps wisely he selected his cast from the ranks of ' character ' actors rather than stars - or , perhaps more pertinently , no ' star ' would be prepared to be killed on screen - but most audiences at the time would be familiar with virtually all of them - Judith Anderson had appeared in Laura , which was possibly still showing , Barry Fitzgerald had copped an Oscar the previous year for Going My Way , Richard Haydn had featured as one of the seven dwarfs / professors in Ball Of Fire , June Duprez was the female lead in The Thief Of Bagdad , etc . Clair did his best to bring a little visual flair to what is essentially a one-set piece , the actors got their lines out without bumping into the furniture ( at least not intentionally ) and a reasonable time was had by all including the viewer . Not perhaps one to treasure or buy on DVD but certainly worth catching on television .

Text2: There are 142 comments for this movie and the handful I've read all address divers points . This seems to make a strong case for Musicals with strong ' Books ' and songs written specifically to further the action as opposed to the Amateur fumblings of the Baz Luhrmans of this world and their inept attempts to quart of one era into the pint pot of another . MFL scores highly in all departments ; strong book , strong score , strong acting , strong sense of period / costume etc . On the other hand it's arguably the Only and certainly one of a very few - in fact I can't think of another offhand - to throw its two Love songs away . The second one WAS intentional because it was written for the leading man , the non-singing Rex Harrison but the earlier example is mystifying . ' On The Street Where You Live ' is a PASSIONATE love song in the best Cole Porter tradition , with a soaring melody by Fritz Loewe and though far from his best certainly adequate lyrics by Alan Lerner . This song is the musical equivalent of the person in the first flush of love who can't Contain his desire to tell the world about it and usually bores his / her friends to death . As performed by Jeremy Brett ( dubbed by Bill Shirley ) it is stripped of all passion and is rather insipid , THIS is someone saying ' Well , I've met this girl and she's . . . all right , I suppose . Not bad , certainly . . . interesting , I suppose you'd say . Not bad looking really , in fact I quite like her ' . Several mainstream singers recorded the song , not least Vic Damone , with whom it has become closely associated so WHY couldn't Warners stretch to a singer who could do it justice . As it stands Jeremy Brett / Bill Shirley between them have managed to snatch a suet pudding from the jaws of a soufflé . The second love song , ' I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face ' is , in many ways the PERFECT love song inasmuch as Lerner and Loewe were faced with writing a love song - and one which doubled as an ' eleven o'clock ' number for a non-singing misanthrope . This is the ' self-discovery ' type of love song and perhaps it needs an Actor as much as if not more than a Singer . Essentially it merely illustrates in words and music the well-documented phenomena of someone ' growing ' on us surreptitiously . This is the perfect song with which to end our story ; a simple end to a sumptuous show . This is definitely and unequivocally one of THE Best Musicals - Broadway and / or Hollywood - of all time .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
845,"Text1: The lives of peasants living in a remote Mexico village are examined in this marvelous film by director Francisco Vargas . The situation parallels , in a way , the conflict in that country that has been in the news for a few years . As the film opens one can see a prisoner being tortured by a soldier . The scene changes to a bucolic setting in which an old man , his son , and grandson are seen boarding a makeshift truck transporting them to a nearby town . The older man , Plutarco , is a violinist and his son , Genaro , plays the guitar . They play for patrons at a restaurant for tips which the grandson , Lucio collects . With their meager earnings they get to eat . One thing is established , Genaro is part of the rebels that are fighting in the mountains nearby . The story changes quite drastically as the men go back to their village . There are soldiers everywhere setting their town on fire . Genaro , who is involved with the rebels flees to a safer place , leaving the older man and his son to fend for themselves . Plutarco wants to help his son but because he must travel through the soldier's camp in order to go to his small piece of land , he becomes the object of curiosity as the fiddler who becomes a figure of amusement for the commander of the troop . Plutarco's violin will become key to the story , as is his relationship with the top army man will be put to a test . Plutarco and Genaro will be together at the end . These men , like most of their friends and neighbors seem doomed because the unfair way life dealt with them . "" El violin "" is an unique film in which poverty and necessity have made the peasants take things into their own hands trying to get rid of the oppressing and ruthless soldiers that keep them down . It seems that the poor men one sees are part of people that are kept in poverty throughout different generations . The peasants get our admiration for being noble and having to put up with conditions no human being should have to face . The acting is excellent in general . Best of all , Angel Tavira , who is seen as the proud and stoic Plutarco . One can see in this man's eyes a distinct hatred for the men that keep him down , yet , he makes a fatal mistake that will prove fatal . Gerardo Taracena has some good moments as Genaro and Gilberto Palacios appears as the commander . One of the best achievements in the film is the crisp black and white cinematography of Martin Boege and Oscar Hijuelos . This is a major triumph for Francisco Vargas who has created a satisfying story about the oppressed people from Mexico .

846,"Text1: I know that this movie has more than a few fans and the Oscars went crazy for "" Good Night and Good Luck "" , please don't hate me or think I have bad taste in films , but the movie just didn't excite me much . My mom and I rented this flick with extreme high hopes and I was more gentle on reviews than my mother was , she fell asleep during the movie , but I stuck through it and went with the story . While it's a beautifully made picture and a story that is capturing , this was just not my type of flick . The characters and type of genre just didn't excite me . The whole movie in my opinion was over all just average . I would however , recommend this for anyone because I think it was a very decent picture to at least watch and give a chance too . Again , this is just my opinion , some pictures capture better to some than to others . So , watch and come up with your own opinion .

Text2: It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there , regardless of what their obsessions are about . You know , being one who idolizes certain somebodies or some things , and given a day that Fate decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh , or be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming about . What would you do , and would you go weak in the knees or be overcome with disbelief that you're actually , finally , realizing your dream ? Panda Po ( voiced by comedian Jack Black ) epitomizes exactly that in Kung Fu Panda , and that struck a chord in me and with many in the audience as well . And for that , no matter how clich� the story would become , it had already done its deal and made the connection . It is no wonder it is rated G here , and I expect that the holiday season would allow cash registers to ring , for animation fans with the different styles utilized to tell the story ( you must be on time and not miss the opening sequence ) , for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress ( Angelina Jolie ) , Crane ( David Cross ) , Mantis ( Seth Rogen ) , Viper ( Lucy Liu ) and Monkey ( Jackie Chan ) - collectively known as the Fearsome / Fab Five , and for the kids , given the obvious reason that hey , the protagonist is a cuddly bear . The marketing department , if not already done , should stock up on the plush toys , not only of the hero , but the supporting casts as well . And make their younger forms available too , for they will sell . Story-wise , I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's Shadow , Eagle Shadow Fist , etc . The formula which follows a misfit with weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training under a kung fu master , finally realizing his true calling in time to defeat the villain everybody fears . With the Jackie Chan movies , the demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction , but since this is G-rated , you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled , but with so many splatter-type movies in recent times , I have to admit this was refreshing , and even having animated animals that talked , didn't irk me as they are just so lovable here , in their own right . It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama , even though they are quite clich� at times if you grew up with the formula , but I thought that was the point . While the trailers might have given away some stuff , there are still lots more available which are hidden up the sleeves , and some minor word replacement such as "" suck "" to "" stink "" , though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and even guess whatever secrets the movie have , actually are . For its stylistic training sequences , they became a throwback and a link to the fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies . The fight choreography isn't done shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters ' forms , and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before . Since it's an animated flick , it was able to , and probably ramped up whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm , to give us everything from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break . It didn't waste any effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material , what with the various names of deadly moves , secret manuals , teacher-student feuds , and the best part of it all ? Humour being quite unexpectedly well placed , with more hits than misses to break out into a hearty laugh by the panda antics . For all its A-list voice actors in the movie , with the likes of Michael Clarke Duncan , Dan Fogler , Ian McShane and those who provide voices to the 5 key animals , Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman vehicle . The bantering between the two is priceless as the latter plays Sifu ( duh ) the master teacher , a highly-strung and serious character who has a past they are shameful about ( don't they all ) . And as his own teacher Oogway ( read : Wu Gui , aka tortoise , voiced by Randall Duk Kim ) advises , herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing ( pardon the pun ) Po , whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior . So begins the forging of friendship , long lasting bonds and trust between the two , even though they got off the wrong footing . And you can probably feel for Po , because for a fanboy type , having your idols scoff at you at first opportunity , is actually quite painful . As a kids movie , there's almost always a message to take away . Here , it's a reminder to believe in oneself , which I guess is a universal theme to instill some confidence in the young ones . You might not look the best , nor are the best amongst your peers , but so long as you have that attitude to want to learn , that should put you in good steed . As a summer blockbuster movie , it's fun , thoroughly entertaining , and doesn't try to be too smart . It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across all age demographics , and an ultimate popcorn fare , so long as you manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda . And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens , I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
847,"Text1: IO NON HO PAURA ( I'M NOT SCARED ) is a radiant film by director Gabriele Salvatores based on the novel by Niccolò Ammaniti ( who also wrote the screenplay ) that quietly puts the premise ' greater love hath no man than he lay down etc ' into the desperately gentle innocence of children . The impact is overwhelmingly beautiful : this film is destined to become one of the most memorable greats in the catalogues of ardent film lovers . The setting is Southern Italy , 1978 , and with the sweeping cinematography of Italo Petriccione we are set in motion with the vista of golden wheat fields where a group of children are traveling toward a secret old house . Michele ( Giuseppe Cristiano ) is with his young sister Maria ( Giulia Matturo ) and in their speed to reach the destination her glasses are broken and Michele pockets them , promising to tape them to avoid their mother's wrath . Once the children reach the abandoned old ruin of a house , games ensue , one fat girl is informed that she has lost the game and must display herself to the boys as punishment . Michele prevents this from happening by taking responsibility and is made to climb into the scary old house and jump out . Michele succeeds and the children mount their bikes to return home to their tiny village . On the way home Michele discovers he has lost his sister's glasses so he returns by himself to the house , sees the glasses atop an odd tin piece hidden by straw . Michele lifts the tin and discovers a deep hole that contains a body covered with a filthy blanket with only a foot in view . Terrified , Michele flees and returns home with his sister . At night Michele's curiosity wins and he sneaks out of his house to return to the old house . There he slowly discovers that the roofed hole contains a living person who begs for water , then food . Over the next few days Michele finds that the hole person is a young boy his age , and though filthy and frightened the young lad Filippo ( Mattia Di Pierro ) grows to depend on Michele and reveals he is terrified , shackled and has been placed there to die . Meanwhile at Michele's odd little home there are strange conversations between his father Pino ( Dino Abbrescia ) and his mother ( Aitana Sánchez-Gijon ) , friends enter their home and the emphasis is always on the television news . A smarmy Milanese man comes to stay with them and Michele is forced to give up his bed and his privacy . Ever mistrustful of the adult darkness , he overhears that his father is involved with the others in a kidnapping of a wealthy family's son - Filippo ! The manner in which Michele tackles this ugly truth , laying down his own safety to prevent the adults from killing Filippo , is the way this movie winds to a superlative , uplifting end . So very much of this story is beyond words : the moments of silence , the looks in the eyes of the children , the power of the human spirit ensconced in the body of young lad named Michele , the manner in which the mind of Michele works through all of the adult reality and makes it credible in his fantasy world - all of these defy description . The work of the entire cast is outstanding and the production aspects of every detail of this film are of the highest order . This is a brilliant little film !

Text2: I'm not sure what this film is really about . I'm not sure I want to know . I think its got something to do with being an examination of the relation ship between Jackie Kennedy , John Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe , but set somewhere else .

I know thats as clear as mud , but I have no idea how to describe this film , other than its weird .

848,"Text1: The Puerto Rican playwright Miguel Pinero ( no relation to the English playwright Sir Arthur Wing Pinero ) was originally a career criminal who turned his life around while serving an armed-robbery sentence in Sing Sing . In an inmates ' playwriting workshop , Pinero wrote the brilliant drama "" Short Eyes "" which deservedly was produced on Broadway . A talented actor as well as a gifted writer , Pinero worked on other projects as well before dying tragically young of complications from his early years of drugs abuse . The movie version of "" Short Eyes "" was filmed in New York City's 19th-century prison the Tombs ( NOT Rikers Island ) , which was closed at the time of the film's production but has since then been re-opened for business . Many of the extras and bit players in this film are actual inmates who were serving minimum-security sentences in the NYC prison system while this movie was made . As one might expect , this movie's depiction of prison life is jarringly accurate . . . as is the foul language . All those prison movies of the 1940s featured Cagney or Bogart in an all-white prison population . In "" Short Eyes "" , we see a prison population of blacks and hispanics ( and black prison guards ) in which white inmates ( all working-class ) are the racial minority . The inmates live in racially-divided conclaves . A black prisoner named Omar has converted to Islam , and he harangues the other blacks for being slaves to the white man . The leader of the white inmates is "" Longshoe "" Charlie Murphy ( a standout performance by actor Joseph Carberry ) . The guards crack down on violence , but occasionally a guard will violate regulations and allow two inmates to brawl for a few minutes so that all the inmates will blow off some aggression which might otherwise lead to a riot . The subject of prison sex is dealt with tactfully in a brief shower scene . A young virginal hispanic inmate has been given the unwanted nickname Cupcakes . When he tries to take a shower , a predatory older inmate named Paco tries to seduce Cupcakes . What happens next . . . or rather what DOESN'T happen . . . makes this the least realistic scene in the film . The other outlet for the prisoners is music . We see Tex-Mex singer Freddy Fender as a Mexican inmate , leading his cellblock neighbours in a jam session . Curtis Mayfield also does double duty as an actor / musician here . There's a weird dance number which ( unlike anything in ' Jailhouse Rock ' ) is very plausible in this cellblock context . The prisoners are tolerant of one another's crimes : murderers , rapists and thieves are all accepted here . Now a new prisoner arrives : a middle-class white man named Clark ( brilliantly played by Bruce Davison ) . Figuring this first-timer is here for a white-collar crime , Longshoe tells Clark the basics of prison routine . But then a guard reveals that Clark is a "" short eyes "" : he's been charged with molesting a child . This is the one crime that these hardened inmates won't tolerate . Clark is now a pariah , and there's a harrowing scene in which the other inmates break down his dignity . . . stealing his cigarettes and bullying him into surrendering the gold chain his mother gave him . Clark has only been charged with a crime , not convicted , but all the inmates are convinced he's guilty . One of the warders has a daughter who was molested . . . not by Clark , but the guard is perfectly willing to scapegoat Clark for another man's crime . There's a riveting scene between Davison and Jose Perez as a trusty named Juan , who questions Clark about his guilt . Clark admits that he's a child molester , but he swears that he can't remember whether or not he committed the specific assault for which he's been arrested . Juan is sceptical about this . In a stark monologue , Clark describes one of his assaults on an underage girl . SPOILERS COMING RIGHT NOW . Because the white prisoners are outnumbered and out-toughed , Longshoe is under pressure to prove he's as hard as the leaders of the black and hispanic groups . While the other prisoners cheer him on , Longshoe grabs a prison knife ( a razor blade with a toothbrush handle ) and he slits Clark's throat . Before the guards arrive , the knife is whisked away . . . to be kept handy for other occasions . In an epilogue , a warder informs the inmates that an investigation has cleared Clark : he didn't commit the crime for which he was arrested . The hard faces of the inmates show they don't care : Clark was a "" short eyes "" , and that's the one unpardonable crime in this place . "" Short Eyes "" is a taut and brilliant movie , with only a couple of scenes that don't quite convince . I'll rate this movie .

Text2: ' Le Bourreau Turc ' is one of the ' stunt ' films of Georges Melies , although with more of a plot than usual . My late wife Diane owned an 8mm acetate print of this movie , which she bought in the 1970s from Blackhawk Films . Whenever she showed this short movie for guests , they invariably cheered during the decapitation , and they always asked her to rewind the film and show this bit over . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . A huge Turkish executioner , wearing a turban and cummerbund , and clutching an enormous scimitar , mans his stall in the bazaar . A gaoler arrives with a chain-gang of four prisoners . The Turk aims his scimitar , and . . . WHAP ! . . . all four heads are cut off in a stroke , and the four headless men collapse onto four stools . No worries , parents : this violence is done cartoonishly , with no bloodshed . It's all down to trick photography . The Turk casually picks up the heads and flings them into a dustbin . Then he goes to sleep . ( No conscience problems for our lad Abdullah . ) While the executioner sleeps , the four bodiless heads climb out of the dustbin and torment him . Ghoulish ? No ; as it's staged here , the sequence is funny and bizarre but not especially frightening . My only complaint is that the trick photography is a trifle too obvious . Yes , I realise that this movie was made a hundred years ago . . . but several of Melies's other trick films from this period didn't show the joins quite so obviously . Georges Melies was a brilliant showman but a terrible businessman . He generally sold outright the exhibition prints of his films , rather than licencing them for hire . Consequently , an entrepreneur would buy one of Melies's movies , dupe it off as many times as needed , and make huge profits whilst Melies made only his fee for the original sale . Sadly , Melies spent his last years in poverty . More than a decade after making his last film , Melies had a chance reunion with one of his former actresses who was now scrimping out a tiny income selling toys in a railway kiosk . Melies married her , and helped run this pathetic little business . Belatedly , a tiny pension from the French government made his life slightly more comfortable . One more neglected genius , alas .

While it's not great , I sort of enjoyed it . The plot was REALLY silly and involves the boys in espionage with Joan Collins along for the ride and a ( surprisingly ) very bad job by Robert Morley as the lead villain . Dorothy Lamour decided to not costar in this one but she does pop up ( playing herself ) in an amusing cameo and sings one song ( Cosby sings too ) . There's also a really silly and pointless bit when Cosby and Hope are sent to outer space . And the ending is desperate . Still , it was well-made and Cosby and Hope were a wonderful team - - their easy banter is great to watch and they made the worst lines seem funny .

Text2: I went into "" 3 : 10 to Yuma "" with fairly low expectations , given James Mangold's track record as a mediocre director and the fact that I'm not necessarily a fan of westerns . How pleasantly surprised I was , then , to find that this particular western is slick and supremely entertaining . "" 3 : 10 to Yuma "" has all the trappings of the traditional western - - outlaws , humble ranchers , gunslingers , salty old-timers , buxom saloon barmaids - - but Russell Crowe and Christian Bale , the outlaw and humble rancher , respectively , bring a contemporary sensibility to the material that feels integrated rather than incongruous . Bale's rancher , Dan Evans , is suffering from feelings of male inadequacy as a result of being on the brink of losing his farm to debt ( he's already lost a leg to the Civil War ) . For two hundred dollars , he joins a group of upright townies who are escorting Ben Wade , vicious bad guy ( Crowe ) , to the train that will take him to Yuma prison . But Wade's loyal band , led by Charlie Price ( Ben Foster as the film's one weak link , giving a grating performance ) , won't let Wade go without a fight . Through clever writing and wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe , the two men almost become allies in making sure Wade gets to the train on time . Wade is so impressed with Evans ' integrity , even though he doesn't understand it , that he almost wants to see Evans succeed , even if that means he himself goes to jail . It's really a fascinating relationship , and it's that element of the film that makes it more than just a standard genre exercise . The last quarter of the film is a nailbiter ; Mangold falls back on that old reliable convention that westerns practically invented , the real time show down , with clocks placed here and there keeping time for the audience , and he does it well . The film belongs to Bale and Crowe , but there's strong acting throughout by the rest of the cast , notably Gretchen Mol in a few brief scenes as Evans ' wife and Peter Fonda as the requisite crusty old-timer .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Hélène Vincent's presence ( the bourgeois woman in Chatiliez's debut ) accentuates this feeling . "" Bernie "" came aside as a shock , in the humdrum field of contemporary French cinema . IMHO , it's better than "" pulp fiction "" because the director took a lot more chances than Tarentino : no stars , shoestring budget , and a "" nasty "" spirit everywhere . Bernie , a thirty years old orphan , leaves the orphanage for "" life outside "" . This is the beginning of a wholesale massacre in which nobody will escape . It leaves nobody unscathed : neither Mickey or Donald , nor the birds or the dogs ; neither the rich , nor the poor ; neither the parents , nor the children ; neither the video stuff clerks , nor the florists ; neither the junkies nor the dealers ; neither the garbage / rubbish chutes , nor the transformers . . . The last fifteen minutes with the hostage-taking are more conventional , but the director manages to concoct an almost dreamlike conclusion , in direct contrast to the rest of the story . A story of paranoia , a story of madness , of absurd logic , "" Bernie "" is all this and more . Bernie feels the society he discovers is dangerous : THEY come to bring you down , to kill you , to throw you in the garbage chute ; the enemy is definitely the OTHERS , so he launches a pre-emptive strike , by shooting everybody in sight , eating the Tweety Pies , closing the garbage chutes with sticky paper . His dream is to live in a safe world , with the parents he's found again ( you should see the parents : the father , Donald , a tramp , the mother , a prole turned bourgeois , who called her son Mickey ( sic ) ) No one will be immune to this aggressive Voltaire's "" Candide "" , Bernie ( aka "" John Fitzgerald "" aka "" Mickey "" ) .

In 1902 , while in leave in London , he is informed by a friend that the British Miss Edith Hunter ( Deborah Kerr ) , who works as a housekeeper in Berlin , wrote a letter telling that a German officer was blaming the British Army of atrocities against the Boers in Africa . Candy travels to Berlin without permission , and after an incident in a fancy restaurant , he is challenged to a duel against Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff ( Anton Walbrook ) . They both are hurt and have to spend eight weeks in a hospital with Edith , becoming friends . Theo falls in love for her , marrying her in the end .

The production values are certainly very polished . But the director takes an overly detailed approach to storytelling - there are quite a few scenes that go on longer than necessary . The thrills are limited : a car chase ends almost as soon as it begins , and a fight between Cassel and a Spanish female assassin ( Najwa Nimri ) is shot in such tight close-ups that you literally can't see any of the moves . As for the insights into the spy business ( "" We're not asking her to collaborate with us ; we're asking her to obey our orders "" ) , they're not exactly groundbreaking stuff .

Text2: In director Frank Borzage's 1924 original version of this film , the character "" Mary Carlton "" ( played by a matured Norma Talmadge ) looks back on her life , and its "" Secrets "" . For this re-make , Mary Pickford ( as Mary Marlowe ) is initially photographed to appear as young as possible . Later , Ms . Pickford is "" aged "" ( although , she is photographed in soft focus throughout ) . So , the entire "" framing "" of the film - as about an old woman looking back on the "" Secrets "" of her life - is lost . Moreover , the movie misses an opportunity to startle audiences by opening with an "" aged "" Pickford . "" Secrets "" is not a bad film - but , it is frustrating to look at a miscalculation , in this last career appearance for Mary Pickford . Both Pickford and Borzage should have had the storytelling wherewithal to go ahead with the "" old age "" framing . Borzage had success with Talmadge's version , and Pickford supported Charlotte Smith ( her mother ) in Thomas H . Ince's similarly structured "" Sweet Memories "" ( 1911 ) . Without the framing , the story blindly lurches , uncomfortably , through the years . Pickford surely knew audiences weren't responding well to her recent features , and likely made what she thought were wise decisions about the filming of "" Secrets "" . So , it is a first class production . This shows in Pickford's selection of director Borzage , photographer Ray June , and co-star Leslie Howard ( as John Carlton ) . Mr . June's photography is beautiful . Mr . Howard , a stage star close to Pickford's own age , is a smart choice for leading man . Ironically , Howard looks much younger than his years . Pickford's choice of vehicle and co-star reveal her continued belief in "" stage "" acting as a way to succeed in talking pictures . To her portrayal , Pickford adds some of the cutesy mannerisms which came to be expected by fans , but plagued much of her later work . These factors help mar her overall performance . Yet , watch for a stand-out scene featuring Pickford and a baby , played silently , during the film's "" western "" portion .

I hated Dennis Quaid's character from the very beginning , honestly . Then we were introduced to Martin Short's character , who was mildly redeeming in terms of quality , and I more or less got into his character . I can't say I really payed very much attention to the film , it really didn't grab my attention . The only thing I really liked was Martin Short's character , and the only really funny bit was about 45 minutes or so into the movie , when Martin first discovers what's happened with Dennis . That was a couple of scenes I did enjoy , but after that it stopped being funny . Save for the scene in the bathroom of the restaurant / cafe a little further into the film , I didn't laugh at all . The "" inside-body "" camera shots were disgusting at times , and seemed to be there mainly for that purpose ( I mean , honestly , Dante could have done that some other way ) , but maybe that's just me .

Text2: Its an odd mix of computer and regular animation who's blending doesn't always seem seamless . It does work better than Dreamworks earlier Spirit since the mix helps to add to the other worldliness of some of the bits . The basic plot has Sinbad trying to steal The Book of Peace from a ship on the ocean . When he finally runs down the ship he finds its commanded by a boyhood friend . Not one to stand on ceremony he attempts to steal the book only to be interrupted by a kraken like being sent by the goddess Eris . Together the pair defeat the beast , in one of the great set pieces of the film , but in the process Sinbad is swept overboard only to be rescued by Eris who tells him to steal the book for her and she'll make him rich . Sinbad agrees , but for reasons left for the viewing , he backs out only to be blamed for the theft anyway . His friend knows he's innocent and takes his place so Sinbad can attempt to get the book back with in the ten days before his execution . Thats the first fifteen minutes . Its not as exciting as all of that , these fifteen minutes I mean , since its badly handled exposition done to get the plot really moving . I have a suspicion that the voyage was designed before the framing sequences and that the inclusion of Eris was done simply because it was a way to get the wheels in motion and have a magical air to it all . The voice cast is uniformly excellent . It is quite possibly the best voice cast of this stature that I've seen in a long time . ( That should be heard ) . The joys of the listening to Pitt , Pfeiffer , and Zeta-Jones is that they really are acting and really are selling the film . I can imagine everyone being on set and acting together even though the fact is far from the truth . The writing is excellent and you can see that the film really was written as if it were a live action film in the way that the characters hang together is a more real way than in many animated films where characters are of a type and nothing more . Here the characters are people which is nice . Because the writing is so good the reasons for things are clearer than in most animated films these are people reasons not cartoon reasons , for example the reason why Sinbad was gone for ten years could only have been come upon by someone who wrote a real script instead of fumbled around with a storyboard . This small moment is , for me one of the high points of the film . The dialog is fantastic , witty and snide and dead nuts on . The film is best viewed as a film that exists only for the voyage since thats the best part and what a voyage it is . Here the film becomes a series of wonderful set pieces that are joy to behold , but are at times regrettably undercut by the bad directed linking material . Beyond saying ignore the links I want to say little about the actual film other than that the kraken sequence , the dragons teeth sequence , the island hopping , the snow bird and several others are fantastic adventure sequences that rouse you up and get you into the mood to go adventuring . This is great stuff . And while this is a grand adventure it should be stated that this is a grand ROMANCE . Oh my word its wonderful , pull those little heart strings why don't you . This is the romance of Nick and Nora or Spencer and Susan , but with action added in . And even as I wax poetic about the movie I must remind you that even as the voyage builds to a conclusion the movie wobbles a bit at the end , not the very end , but a couple of minutes before when I was going to myself , "" thats it ? You mean all of that and thats it ? "" Its bad direction I'm telling you ( that or studio interference ) . there shouldn't be that bump towards the end . . .

Text2: Although several "" film experts "" are in this documentary on the great classic gangster film , "" Public Enemy , "" most of the opinions are expressed by current movie director Martin Scorcese . You could just tell that if Jimmy Cagney was in his prime today , Scorcese would have him as his main actor . He loves him . . . . . but who doesn't ? Of all Scorcese's comments here , the one I liked the best ( and I think he did , too ) concerned the reaction the young people had when he showed this movie while filming "" The Aviator . "" Leonardo DiCaprio , other actors and a bunch of 20 - something guys who worked behind the cameras , all watched "" Public Enemy "" on a big screen on the set . They all loved the movie and applauded at the end . Nobody thought this film was dated and they were awed by some of the startling scenes they saw in this movie . "" Public Enemy "" is over 75 years old and young people still find this very entertaining ! It speaks volumes for the film . Scorcese also noted something else that I found very interesting : none of the violence in this movie is ever seen ! It's all done off-screen . You don't see it , but you are in the same area in which it happens and you get the idea of its brutality through reactions of other people , or their screams . It's very effective and impresses Scorcese , who admits his shortcoming in being unable to do this in his own violent movies ! He thinks it makes some of the violence much worse . He makes his point by showing us some good examples in this documentary . Also in this 20-minute DVD bonus feature , we hear comments about actress Jean Harlow and director William Wellman , and we see some of the famous scenes in this movie and what makes them effective . . . . . in addition to the violent ones noted above .

According to the commentators here , that's what a lot of these gangsters acted like in real life : cocky and brutal . Cagney , who grew up on the tough streets of New York , was a realistic guy to be playing roles like the one he did here .

861,"Text1: As Ingmar Bergman's "" swan song "" ( which wasn't necessarily the case once After the Rehearsal and the recent Saraband were released ) , Fanny and Alexander was a film I saw many months ago , in its truncated , 3-hour version . I knew I had witnessed something special , something life-affirming , and above all a work that contained enough poetry , passion , and humanity for two movies . But I also felt as if there was something missing here and there . So , once the complete TV version was released , as with Scenes from a Marriage , I jumped at the opportunity to view it in its entirety . Broken up here into 5 Acts , Bergman takes another semi-autobiographical approach to his storytelling , and it's a sumptuous tale of a turn of the 20th Century family ( the Ekdahls , comprising of Oscar and Emilie , the parents , Fanny and Alexander , the kids - Alexander being mostly the driving force behind the story - and also the other relatives Carl and Gustov Adolf , brothers of Oscar , Helena , Alma , Lydia , and also the housemaid Maj ) who own a theater company . What makes Fanny and Alexander work as a major achievement , if anything else for my money is that all the elements seem balanced out over the acts , with story and characters , each sharply defined . The first act unfolds with attention to the little details and the more prevalent ones in a family gathering . A key speech made by Oscar is a haunting bit of foreshadowing before they set off for the family dinner . This scene , involving more or less two dozen people , is sometimes very funny , sometimes a little unnerving , and towards the end depressing . But scenes such as these reveal how wonderful and exciting Bergman can be with his material and actors - despite it taking place in 1907 , you can see these people in modern settings just as easily . There's also the scene involving Oscar with his children before they go to sleep , in which he tells them a story , which ranks as one of the more memorable , touching scenes of the film - from here , we can understand how this brings to Alexander ( Bertil Guve , in a performance that is touching by being so straightforward with the innocence of child-hood ) to the state he's in for much of the rest of the picture . Then the second and third acts come around , and the tragedy unfolds as penetrating as I've seen in any film , much less from Bergman . It wouldn't spoil it to say that Oscar succumbs to an illness , and passes away . From here , Emilie ( Ewa Fröling , a performance meant for Liv Ullman , which she fits just as well ) tries to go on as usual , and it just doesn't feel the same . She seeks counsel from the village bishop , Edvard Vergerus ( Jan Malmsjo , previously in Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage ) , and subsequently falls in love with him , or at least thinks she does . They get married , and the children are forced into leaving ( almost ) everything behind to live at his dreary , caged residence , a far cry from where they once lived , a place lush with colors and life in the rooms . Both of these assets are provided by an Oscar winning production design team , and the foundations of how these two , including as well the theater , display how period-perfect some of this can be . The last two acts are when things get rough , which is a standard Bergman is known for . This kind of standard , if I could call it such , includes his personal connection to the Christian church , in particular with his father being a Lutheran priest . I'm not guessing on how fact based Bishop Vergerus is to Bergman's life , and I really don't want to either . One of the things I loved about the film ( than some likely hated on it's original release - I know , for example , that my father was devastated after watching this film ) is how the good and the bad , or what could be seen as good and bad , are paired off , and how the middle-ground is just as clear or un-clear . Emilie is a good person , wanting the best for her children and for herself , but she doesn't know how to do that without someone to bring guidance when she cannot after grieving for her dead husband ( who appears sometimes to Alexander , which is another matter ) . Alexander , who is a child raised with all the enthusiasm to express himself as such by his uncles and particularly his theatrical father Oscar , is good but lending himself to not being too firm on what's real and what is not . The Bishop , on the other hand , is one who , as he says at one point "" has only one mask "" . His is a puritanical approach , who sees imagination in only one strict aspect , and has terms of love that are by his code of living and understanding of people . Veregus , along with his family that live in fear and suffering ( Harriet Andersson's character , and with the character of the heavy , ill aunt ) , know little is anything about how the Ekdahls have lived . What ends up happening , even from the get-go of the third act , in the fourth and fifth acts Bergman reveals Bishop Veregus to be an immense antagonist , one that allows just enough sympathy in one or two spots to not throw something at the TV , but with the kind of language that only the most terrifying of movie characters possess . Bottom line , this character , whether you like the film or not , is one of Bergman's greatest creations , and is pulled off by Malmjso with icy , disturbing perfection ; it's one of the most memorable of the kind in film I can think of , right up there with Nurse Ratched , HAL 9000 , and Darth Vader . But what torment and anguish the characters , as well as much of the audience , seem to endure in the fourth / fifth acts ; there also comes revelatory moments of sheer beauty and enchantment . A couple of scenes involving Alexander in the puppet shop , for example , display a level of artistry that goes between Bunuel and Disney . And a particular , long soliloquy by Isak ( Erland Josephsson , not under-used at all ) to the children is a poem unto itself that gives me an idea that Bergman had he not gone into theater and film , would've been one of the great poets of the 20th century . As the catharsis comes , it comes with a kind of justice that works in the only way it satisfyingly could have . With the fates of the Bishop , Emilie , and Alexander and Fanny brought to a close , as with the Grandmother , the uncles and aunts , and so on , it's all very symbolic , metaphorical , and real , and it gels together . One last note - Sven Nykvist , who one his second Oscar with Bergman for this film , creates the kinds of shots that some could only have in their dreams . When he visualizes something for Bergman with the forces of light and dark , with the subtlety and nuance , it's all the better . To put this all in another way , I could go on and on about this huge , heart-rendering work , but it all comes down to this - as an emotional , intellectual , and spiritual ( surprisingly for me , who sees religion as a kind of fantasy ) sort of film-viewing experience , Fanny and Alexander is one of the most profound I've ever had . Some may feel the same ; some may want to forget they ever experienced it . But one thing the film does is stick with you , if only for a little while , and that's really what a film can and should do . . . . by the way , the 5-hour version , at least in America , is only available on a high-priced special edition DVD pack from Criterion , but for the viewer who's already a fan of the film , it makes for a great holiday gift .

Text2: There's almost a kind of bridge between the westerns of old and the sort of last legs of the western in this film - it has the good ol ' sensibilities of the classics ( loyalty , honor , the power of the sheriff , the quirkiness and durability of the ones around him , shoot-outs ) , while also giving some room for some more modern ones ( Dean Martin as ' Dude ' , Angie Dickinson as ' feathers ' , and the overall excitement ) . It has a song at one point ( obviously for one its stars , the late Ricky Nelson , a popular singer at the time ) . It has the crotchety , funny old man ( Walter Brennan as Stumpy , one of his best roles ) . And , of course , the ' Duke ' John Wayne , who has his usual swagger and qualities that make him a prime figure of the ' male ' in films . This time though , he does have some of his tough exterior shed away a little , maybe . Howard Hawks , if nothing else , is most powerful as a storyteller , doing almost nothing with the style of his camera to be creative except to shoot these people , going through the motions . The story , which later was used as a basis for John Carpeneter's Assault on Precinct 13 , has Wayne as the Sheriff and Dean Martin as his on and off again drunken deputy ' Dude ' , who have to look after a criminal in their jail , as he has a brother with a gang who are plotting to break him out . As the Sheriff , or Chance as he's called , has to deal with this , he also has the woman , and the old man , and Dude ( Martin is great in the film , maybe the best male performance of the lot ) , not to mention the hot-to-trot young gunslinger played by Nelson . In all , it's the kind of genre film that should be taken seriously on one hand , but on the other , its meant to be a rollicking good time through the less tense and exciting parts ( and there are quite a few from a director who once said that ' there's no action without danger ) . It lacks a kind of urgency that some of Hawks ' other films have , and occasionally Wayne is a little too much "" The Duke "" to see if he's really giving a well-rounded performance as the sheriff . But besides that , it makes for some very memorable moments , a slick ending , and some endearing performances . It's also a film that takes its characters to heart as much as its story ; a credit to screenwriters Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett ( the later one of my favorites of the period ) . Not quite a masterpiece , but its definitely worth watching at least once if you're getting into the genre .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Are you bothered by base humor that goes for the lowest common denominator ? Get you get past woman being nothing more than objects to take their clothes off ? Do you laugh at poop jokes or for that matter just really dumb jokes ? If you know a bit about Japanese culture and can laugh at stupid jokes then this is for you . Starting as one man's quest to get a car so he can have sex in it , this film morphs into a destruction of dozens of Japanese icons . It proves that Western eyes aren't the only ones who find much of Japanese culture silly . If you have a passing awareness of what they are sending up and tearing down this is absolutely hysterical . Granted you won't get everything , but you'll probably smile from start to finish with frequent bursts of laughter . One of the chief reasons this works is that there is intelligence behind the humor . Yes , the hero is a pig , and his attitudes towards women are terrible , but thats the point and much of the pain that he ends up getting he deserves for being the way he is . The jokes about the icons is often dead on , for example the film dismantles Lone Wolf and Cub in a minute and a half so perfectly I doubt that I'll be able to watch the movies with a straight face ever again . If you know Japanese culture and love to laugh see this movie . You may not love it all , but you will laugh . A word of warning - this movie would be rated R if released in the US .

Text2: Howard Hughes was the notorious playboy of the 1930s and ' 40s who wooed every Hollywood starlet in sight and was responsible for delivering aircraft to the United States government at the cost of $56 million . He ran well over-budget and never delivered any planes , although his monstrosity "" The Hercules "" - - at the time , the largest aircraft in the world - - was eventually built and did , in fact , fly . "" The Aviator "" chronicles Hughes ' life - - from his childhood to the point at which he first became obsessive about germs , his hands and so on and so forth . Hughes became increasingly eccentric and insane as time went on and by the end of the film I think Scorsese does something rather brilliant in terms of narrative effect - - I won't give it away but suffice to say it's a nice little conclusion to the movie . The movie itself is quite good but tries a bit too hard . The acting is top-notch and DiCaprio holds his own as Howard Hughes , proving once again he's more than just a pretty face . Cate Blanchett perfectly imitates Kate Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale is a great Ava Gardner . However I feel some material could have been cut . Some scenes really held my interest and I momentarily was lost in the film - - then there were sequences throughout which I felt bored and wished it would move on . Also , I found the subtitles ( posted on the screen to introduce new characters , e . g . JOHN SMITH - FRIEND OF HOWARD HUGHES ) a rather dubious element - - I expected better from Scorsese . . . introducing new characters with subtitles seems sloppy and far too easy for such a master filmmaker . I also felt "" The Aviator "" lacked Scorsese's overall typically energetic visuals , opting more for a bloated epic style - - one gets the feeling Scorsese was in it for the Oscar this year and was out to prove to the Academy that he could make a typical epic . There are a few tracking shots but other than that , it really didn't feel like "" A Martin Scorsese Picture . "" On the plus side I found the cinematography quite nice , the musical score entirely fitting , the cameos amusing ( Alec Baldwin , Willem Dafoe and Jude Law amongst others ) , and most of the dialogue believable . "" The Aviator "" is not Martin Scorsese's best film , nor would I call it the best film of 2004 . It is not flawless , but it does manage to entertain for the most part and is a solid insight into the life of Hughes . If I had one complaint , I'd say about thirty minutes altogether could have been edited out and replaced with more interesting material ( or none at all ) , but as it stands , "" The Aviator "" is a very good movie .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
866,"Text1: It's unfortunate that this film doesn't have more of a reputation . Had it not been for a four movie DVD compilation from Diamond Entertainment , I would never have come across it . The story involves a scheming wife out to murder her husband , a plot that backfires when her lover botches the job and winds up dying himself in a fiery crash . Poetic justice there , but the follow up is where things get interesting , as jilted protagonist Walter Williams ( Brian Donlevy ) spends his time trying to sort things out while keeping his real identity a secret . Helen Walker turns in a strong performance as the two faced Irene Williams , a character you'll love to hate as the story progresses . She showed she could think on her feet when being tailed by a detective and when her husband unexpectedly shows up after his three month disappearance . It's somewhat of a surprise then when one of the ' keys ' to her undoing winds up in her coat pocket . I couldn't quite warm up to the romance between Williams and would be mechanic Marsha Peters ( Ella Raines ) . Even in her garage gear she's an absolute knockout , and to be smitten with Donlevy's character seemed to be a bit of a stretch . Fortunately though , she had the tenacity and energy to team up with Detective Clancy ( Charles Coburn , not that one , the other one ) . Credit Clancy with the suitcase connection that finally unhinged Mrs . Williams ' story . Everything about the late 1940's settings works well , from the busy streets of San Francisco to the bucolic trappings of Larkspur , Idaho . My own home town had the same type of fire department signal system used in the story while I was growing up , so that was a neat memory . I'm sure younger viewers will have no idea what the ' Klondike 2 ' telephone number is all about , and when was the last time your cab ride cost $1 . 15 ? Throughout "" Impact "" , I couldn't help drawing comparisons with another noir flick from a few years earlier , 1945's "" Conflict "" starring Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet . In that one , the scheming partner in a murder plot is the husband ( Bogey ) , and the deed is done on top of a winding mountain road . It's got a clever twist that trips up the bad guy without using a trunk full of evidence . Both films suggest that some of the best noir efforts of the ' 40's and ' 50's had single word titles .

Text2: Stunning Canadian Rockies scenery add a dramatic backdrop to "" River of No Return "" , a fairly predictable tale involving a recently released convict ( Robert Mitchum ) , and an out of place Marilyn Monroe who's physical presence and colorful saloon outfits are the stuff of repeated double takes . Oddly , Monroe winds up being well cast here , even to the point of singing a few tunes that hold up surprisingly well . Mitchum's character is Matt Calder , newly reunited with a nine year old son last seen before serving a prison sentence for shooting a man in the back . As the story unfolds , we learn extenuating circumstances were behind the killing , causing a certain amount of angst to come between the boy and his father as a result of the disclosure . ' Mark follows Matthew ' in the Bible , thus serving as the basis for young Mark Calder's name , portrayed by Tommy Rettig . If you were a baby boomer kid growing up in the 1950's like me , Tommy Rettig might have been one of your first small screen heroes , or at least his pal Lassie was . My weekly fix of "" Lassie "" came on Sunday evenings on CBS , a tough call going up against "" The Wonderful World of Disney "" on the NBC network . When Timmy outgrew Lassie , it seemed like the magic was gone . Rory Calhoun is the film's obligatory bad guy and fiancée to Monroe's character . He's a bit tough to recognize if you're used to his role as "" The Texan "" in the 1958 Western series ; perhaps it was the mustache . I'd be curious to learn more about the scene involving Matt Calder's forced advance on Monroe's Kay during the trip along the river . Though discreetly interrupted by the interference of a mountain lion , it seems the lead character of the story came pretty close to attempted rape . I wonder how audiences of the time reacted to that particular scene . Always on the lookout for historical perspective in films , I got a kick out of two saloon signs - ' Whiskey , 25 cents per swallow ' , followed by ' Good Whiskey , 4 Bits ' . Oh , for the good old days ! It occurred to me that the movie's title might have been more than just a passing reference to the hazards met and overcome along the way by the intrepid adventurers , and something other than the subject of one of Marilyn Monroe's saloon songs . It struck me as somewhat allegorical that the act of saving his father's life in the same manner that sent Matt Caulder to jail , would now serve as the flash point in his life that young Mark could never retreat from , a certain departure from innocence to which he could never return .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: Why the Nazis chose to spend a lot of money to make a film about the Titanic during the middle of WWII I'll never know . You can see that the real story of the ship is twisted into a propaganda piece that both extols German decency and decries the evils of a Capitalist society . It does this by creating some Germans and making them all nice folks - - particularly the First Officer that tries very hard to do what is right even though Captain Smith and the nefarious forces of Capitalistic greed are risking the lives of everyone aboard ! In the National Socialist Germany , the importance of individual profit and gain was publicly forbidden and America and Britain were seen as dominated by selfish self-interest . So the "" nice Germans "" are always mindful of the ultimate good and the rich Americans are the worse stereotypes of Capitalism . And so time and again , the First Officer is good and dutiful and tries his best to protect the ship and passengers while industrialists / speculators Ismay and Astor do everything purely for self-interest . All this was meant to convince Germans of the rightness of their political system , though the ugly truth was that many rich German industrialists became immensely wealthy thanks to German re-armament . Despite the obvious propaganda in the film , the movie itself was surprisingly well-made . While the shot of the Titanic ( using a model ) was incredibly sloppily done ( with VERY fuzzy camera-work to try to hide that it was a model ) , the rest of the film looks pretty opulent and the acting was very convincing considering it was made in 1943 - - as things were turning VERY bad for the Germans .

In the last years of her life , Martha Raye hoped to get a film made based on her experiences performing in the USO during World War Two .

So , I have a lot of sympathy for Martha Raye as a person even while I intensely dislike her as a performer . And she's extremely unfunny in this movie . Several reliable character actors are in ' $1 , 000 a Touchdown ' - Eric Blore , Tom Dugan , Matt McHugh , Jimmy Conlin - but none of them have any decent material . All of them have been funny elsewhere , but none are funny in this movie . I was grateful for the presence of tall shapely brunette Joyce Mathews as a campus vamp . I'll rate ' $1 , 000 a Touchdown ' .

Text2: The first thing to take note in Red Lights is that the story is not rushed : Antoine ( Jean-Pierre Darrousin ) is perhaps a passive-aggressive , or maybe just having a mid-life crisis . He and his wife Helene are planning for a trip to pick up the kids from summer camp . But the drive hits some things in the way - he has a beer and a whiskey before leaving ; a traffic jam gets to Antoine ; he drinks again at a roadside ; he and his wife bicker ; he drinks again ; she leaves , and once he realizes he can't catch up with her , he decides to have a night with a little more drinking ahead . While he says he doesn't drink too often ( "" two , three times a year "" , he says ) , this night is different . Especially with a fugitive somewhere out on the loose , as the radio says . Cedric Kahn is a skilled and trust-worthy director ( via France ) for a few reasons in dealing with his latest film Red Lights . He doesn't make the pace in the tenser scenes ( with a couple of juicy exceptions ) really quick cut like in a choppy Hollywood piece . He brings an interesting blend of visuals with the city and the roads , the cars , then as it grows darker outside , the lights outside become key . When Antoine awakes the next morning on the roadside , he's out in the country . As well , he has a great blend of music from Debusy , whom I may have heard before this film but never recognized . It's a fascinating element to add with the impending doom of the film's story . But the key thing that the director can do for a film is the right casting , and here's it's impeccable in dealing with the three leads . Jean-Pierre Darrousin is terrific at conveying the mind-set of this husband in a rocky relationship . Then in the second and third acts , despite what he's doing on the road , he keeps consistent in keeping as the film's reluctant hero . Credit should also be given to first-time actor Vincent Deniard , who is perfect at being the "" quiet one you got to watch "" . And Carole Bouquet is a fair counterpart to a Darrosin . Although the denouement starts to drag , for my money the film's main chunk doesn't . It would be one thing if Antoine just got drunk . But there's also a good interest in the talking points with the character , as he decides to blow his mind in the process . Red Lights is definitely an art-house film that won't please everyone ( the film ends rather realistically , without the kind of extra bit American audiences might want that's more intimate here ) , but it's still very compelling .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
871,"Text1: The idea behind this film isn't bad , and that is that there's a family of grave-robbing casket recyclers that inter bodies and then dig then up later to recover the caskets and whatever other goodies happen to be attached to the corpses . The execution of this idea is where this goes wrong , and rather badly too . Filmed on video , first of all , terrible sound , as in , if you turn it up so you can hear the dialog you're then blown through a wall when a special effect kicks in , and there's a lot of apparently ambient noise too , like someone left a garbage disposal running or something . The acting is fair to poor , and overall the production quality just plain sucks . There are periods where I felt kind of sucked in to what was going on though but those were generally shattered by something stupid . The idea is that one person that the grave robbers dug up was a druid and his sister ( who is a druidess ? ) conjures something over his grave and the dead rise and open up a can of whoop-ass on the bad guys . Ho hum , more walking dead . I had wondered about this for a while and found a cheap copy ( wonder why ) so decided to give it a whirl . I would like to take the disc and give it a whirl ( out the window ) but will put it in my trade-in pile and hope I can get it to the trade-in store before they have 20 other copies .

Text2: This is a low-budget flick that is already disturbing and creepy long before it actually even gets to the meat of what's going on . Three young men , who have a secret in their past that they share , are brought together in the same town again after the father of one dies and he returns for the funeral . Talk about dysfunctional families , too , sis is pretty wasted a lot of the time , apparently , and Uncle Tom , well , he carries a case full of cutting implements , and even gets frisky with his niece , wow . At any rate the secret these young men share is something to do with a foundling they took into their care and raised up in a cabin in the woods ( and named him Joshua ) until they decided that what they were doing had gone too far ( by far ) and they torched the place to be done with it . But one of the three wasn't having any of that and apparently none of the three went unaffected by what they had done later in their lives , which is now , while you're watching , and it's not pretty . For the most part , despite the low budget , this is excellent and the acting is good , and it's creepy and disturbing far beyond anything else that's come out in recent memory .

Text2: Big disappointment . I've heard such great things about this French horror film , but it doesn't at all live up to them . Sure , it has its moments , but most of the time , it's fairly dull . An experimental surgeon ( Pierre Brasseur ) is trying to graft the faces of young women he kidnaps onto his daughter , who lost hers in a car accident . Alida Valli plays the assistant who carries out the kidnappings . The situation is definitely promising , but the film just plods along . Valli was never more bland , and Brasseur is weak , as well . The film only comes alive when Edith Scob , the daughter , appears . That mask , featured on the DVD cover , is very creepy itself . And when we actually see Scob's face , she's one of the most beautiful women imaginable . I like the fact that Franju gives us that pleasure halfway through the film , and then cruelly takes it away through a photo montage of the skin graft's deterioration . Which would be the best moment of the film , if not for the excellent ending . So I guess I kind of liked it . I only wish it were a lot better . If you get the Criterion DVD , make sure to watch the short The Blood of Beasts . It's better than the feature , though be warned : it's not for the easily queasified . .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

They're a wealthy bunch although the film never tells us where they got their money from . Colman was an outstanding actor and he is able to rise above the boring film and give a splendid performance as a man devoted to his social mores of the time . The problem is that he is about to wreck the lives of his son and daughter by his obstinate ways . In reality , he is nothing more than a snob who quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson to justify his ways . You know that he will eventually come to his senses but you don't care as this film just moves along at a dull pace . As his sister , Mildred Natwick ( Amelia ) has some funny lines but that's about it . You would think that being born in Boston to wealth meant that you remained there for good and acted in an outlandish way .

884,"Text1: It's really a shame that Terrence Malick didn't have the brilliant career he deserved at Hollywood . Shot with a nearly shoestring budget , "" Badlands "" remains one of the most dazzling debut movies of all time . Malick's legend based on his ( long ) absence has helped it to become a cult-movie . Inspired by a tragic short news item which took place in 1959 ( a young couple who decides to commit a series of free murders to leave a mark in history ) , the odds are that Malick's first feature-length movie inspired Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarantino for their dangerous and irresponsible "" Natural Born Killers "" ( 1994 ) . Concerning Tarantino , I read an interview about him in which he expressed his admiration of Malick's work . It shows that the author of "" Pulp Fiction "" ( 1994 ) has a great esteem for this talented and mysterious film-maker . At the same time , we can also note down that Malick's work inspired Bruce "" the Boss "" Springsteen two songs : "" Badlands "" on his "" darkness on the edge of town "" album ( 1978 ) and "" nebraska "" on the eponymous LP ( 1982 ) . An American journalist had written that "" Badlands "" was the best mastered movie in the history of cinema since "" Citizen Kane "" ( 1941 ) by Orson Welles . One can judge this affirmation as exaggerated but it is nevertheless indisputable that Malick's opus strikes on numerous aspects : an assertive and opaque story , a fluid making , a relevant screenplay , an original photography which gives to the landscapes an image of desolation and lost paradise perturbed by a free violence . The work is also strongly steeped in a certain poetry . Concerning the two main characters , a French critic had written that it was difficult to feel liking for these two irresponsible . I think that this critic badly analyzed the film . Terrence Malick doesn't try to make them likable to us . He describes them without kindness and condescension . They haven't got an imposing personality and live only through an intermediary myth . It is particularly obvious for the young man ( Martin Sheen ) who is obsessed with James Dean . One can also say that Sissi Spacek's voice-over which tells this dramatic story is of an amazing neutrality . Then , unlike many criminal lovers , Sheen and Spacek will live at the heart of this violence and the latter won't bring them together or take them away . With "" Badlands "" , Malick was judicious for the choice of the actors . In a way , his first movie enabled to put Sheen and Spacek on the map and it also launched their respective careers . Then , what happened to Terrence Malick after this sensational debut movie ? A second movie , "" Days of Heaven "" ( 1978 ) starring Richard Gere as successful as "" Badlands "" . After that , for twenty years , nothing . However , in 1998 , Malick made a rather successful come-back with "" the Thin Red Line "" ( 1998 ) . According to the latest news , he would currently shoot a movie about the first years of America's colonization in the beginning of the seventeenth century .

I don't even remember the plot of this film , but you're not supposed to watch these films for the plots anyway . Like "" The Big Sleep "" two years later , the point of Bogie and Bacall films are Bogie and Bacall . If their hard-boiled style of playing off one another works for you , then you're going to love this movie and any of their other films . But if not , then there's not much else here to keep your interest . This is the first time I'd ever seen Lauren Bacall as a young actress , and I was astounded at how deep her voice was . There's a scene in which a large group of men and Bacall are gathered around a piano , and this deep voice begins a song . I kept looking around the frame , trying to find the man who was singing , only to realize that it was Bacall . My goodness , that woman ate her spinach !","{""output"": ""NO""}"
885,"Text1: The first Maniac Cop film is one of the supreme trash classics from the eighties ; and its sequel , the imaginatively titled ' Maniac Cop 2 ' is about as good as a sequel could have been . However , in true sequel fashion ; this third outing is extremely poor . The film is subtitled ' Badge of Silence ' , but ' Bride of Maniac Cop ' would be more appropriate , since that's the road that the second sequel has chosen to go down . Once again , we have William Lustig directing a script written by Larry Cohen ; this team worked so well on the first two films , but something hasn't clicked this time around . The entire movie feels like it cant really be bothered , with the plot serving only in dishing up the relevant elements for Matt Cordell ; the ' maniac cop ' to go on another killing spree . We see a voodoo priest resurrect the mental copper shortly before witnessing police officer Kate Sullivan gets killed during an armed robbery . For some , largely unexplained , reason ; Matt Cordell decides that he wants to make Kate his bride . It's not long before Sean McKinney ( the hard-bitten detective from Maniac Cop 2 ) begins to suspect that Cordell may be back on the scene . One of the main problems with this film is the scenes with the maniac cop . There aren't enough of them for a start , and the ones there are merely show him powering his way through people , and this fails to capture the creepiness of the original . Robert Z'Dar is still imposing in the only role that his name is associated with ; but his presence was much better handled in the previous two films . I quite like Robert Davi ; he's no Bruce Campbell or Tom Atkins , but he looks the part as the experienced policeman , and definitely fits this sort of film well . The atmosphere is well created again , with a foreboding New York feel accompanying most of the street scenes ; which is a shame since most of the film takes place in a hospital . The police force itself isn't portrayed very well , and there isn't a single scene that is really convincing . The film has a very direct to video feel throughout also , and no attempt is ever made to mask the fact that you're watching a worthless piece of crap . The violence is fairly heavy , although there isn't a lot of blood ; and the final car chase goes on far too long , and manages to drain the last bit of energy from an already frail film . If you loved the first two , you might find something here . But then again , you might not . Skip it .

Text2: What does one make of Dogville ? I can say , without risking speaking out of turn , that this is the most originally styled movie in the history of movies . The film starts by introducing us to the town of ' Dogville ' , which is basically just a lay out that consists of white lines on a black canvass . Naturally , I expected the film to switch to a more proper set once it started proper - but it doesn't ! Flamboyant Danish director Lars Von Trier leaves us with just this very basic set , and I was expecting to start hating the film very quickly for that very reason . But this style only allows Von Trier to show what a talented artist he really is , as the lack of distractions allows him to put the focus on the acting and story , both of which are immense . The story is rich with themes of acceptance and retribution , while the entire cast - which consists of many smaller European stars - prove their worth by delivering it in a way that is engaging and thought provoking . We follow Grace ( Nicole Kidman ) who , while on the run from gangsters , stumbles into Dogville where the locals agree to take her in . ? at a price . I admire the audacity and bravery of Lars Von Trier for making this movie , which most people , frankly , would have laughed at if they heard the idea before seeing the movie . The movie clocks in at just less than three hours , but you honestly wouldn't believe it while watching . Von Trier has shown that all a movie needs to work is a strong story and some good actors to deliver it . Dogville is story telling at it's most basic as it is delivered with hardly any means other than dialogue and acting , and so requires a talented auteur to tell it , which it has in Lars Von Trier . The director has made many original and inventive films , and has gained quite a good reputation , of which this film only adds to . One thing that many people tend to think of movies these days is that there's no originality left , which is true to an extent , but my response to those people is simple - watch ' Dogville ' and reconsider .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The endless talk talk talk is alleviated occasionally as Marvin goes out to see the company's captain , who also lives in a wrecked basement . Dmytryk and the screenwriters have done very little to expand this for the screen . You may , if you like , interpret this as a failure of nerve of Dmytryk's part : he had originally refused to testify as to who was a Communist before the House Unamerican Activities Committee . A few months in jail broke his resolve , and he spent the remainder of his career directing ever larger , ever glossier and ever emptier films .

Text2: This B movie remake of MANHATTAN MELODRAMA set in the Yukon was the one of the salvos that MGM fired in its attempt to use James Craig as a replacement for Gable while the King of Hollywood was at war . Craig is pretty good at the Gable role and there is a pretty good supporting cast , including Keenan Wynn , Jack Holt and particularly John Carradine as a crooked gambler . The problem is that Patricia Dane in the female lead is pretty stiff trying to play her role like Myrna Loy and William Lundigan , although competent , brings not a hint of the sparkle that William Powell did to his performance . Nor does director Joseph Newman take advantage of the nominally outdoor nature of the big finale . Everyone moves as if they are on a sound stage and the ending is abrupt .

Text2: I enjoyed this movie , sure it isn't the most original movie ever made or the best , but it was what it set out to be . . . which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50's plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70's . A lot of critics don't like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don't care much for it either , but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96 . I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well . One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like "" The Two Towers "" where it doesn't feel like all that much time has passed . Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater . This movie has a score of only six at imdb , so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV . Or if they did see it at the theaters , realized it just wasn't as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV . The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed . The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50's science fiction movie . It also has a lot of stars , not the biggest names , just like a 70's disaster flick . If you don't care for either of these genres you probably won't like this movie , but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out . Just don't take it too seriously and have fun watching it .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
888,"Text1: A WARNER BROS . VITAPHONE Short Subject . A pair of dancing sweethearts carry on a private romance in a very public department store window . TIP TAP TOE is an enjoyable little film and serves primarily as a showcase for its incredibly lithe & limber young stars Hal LeRoy and Mitzi Mayfair , stars of the Ziegfeld Follies of 1931 . The story is very silly , but agreeable , and the plot doesn't get too much in the way of the highly energetic duo . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .

Text2: New York City - the height of the Great Depression . Four showgirls , starving , scheming for that next role in a Broadway musical comedy . Looking for the Big Break . Auditioning for every part . Often down , but never downhearted . Using men , loving men , cheating men . These are the GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 . This is a wonderful comedy - funny , tuneful & easy on the intellect . Plus , the magic of Busby Berkeley's musical numbers . It's the kind of entertainment that kept audiences happy for a few hours during the dark days of economic despair in the early 1930's . The cast is first-rate : brassy Joan Blondell ; cynical Aline MacMahon ; innocent Ruby Keeler & on-the-make Ginger Rogers . Keeler lands handsome & mysterious Dick Powell , ( who gets to croon some attractive Harry Warren tunes ) ; and acerbic but loyal producer Ned Sparks . Warren William & Guy Kibbee turn up late in the proceedings , playing priggish bluenoses who are nonetheless highly susceptible to alcohol & feminine wiles . Movie mavens will recognize Charles Lane as a society reporter ; Ferdinand Gottschalk as a disgruntled club member ; and Sterling Holloway as a messenger boy . Some years back , in an introduction to a book about THE WIZARD OF OZ's Munchkins , dwarf Billy Barty stated that he was ' too young ' to appear in that 1939 movie . This , of course , is nonsense , and he can easily be spotted in the ' Pettin ' In The Park ' number here . As he would in FOOTLIGHT PARADE , he rather disturbingly portrays a lecherous tot , a sure indication , if nothing else , that this is a pre-Production Code film . Mr . Berkeley does get to have some fun . The film starts with ' We're In The Money ' featuring Ginger Rogers & girls clad in coins large & small ; Rogers even gets to sing one chorus in pig Latin . ' Pettin ' In The Dark ' extols the joys of bucolic lovemaking , segues to simulated , silhouetted female nudity and rather bizarrely ends with the chorus all metal-corseted ( Powell is given a can opener to use on Keeler ) . ' The Shadow Waltz ' is Berkeley at his most romantic , with its helix-skirted ladies pretending to play fluorescent , fake violins , all moving in a multitude of weaving patterns staged for the famous overhead camera shots . The film's emotional punch comes at the end , with Blondell's tempestuous rendition of ' Remember My Forgotten Man ' - with its endless marching men , a blues wail for the doughboys of the Great War , ruined by the Depression . The movie ends on this somber note . ( Powell also gets to warble ' I've Got To Sing A Torch Song ' ) .

892,"Text1: I have , in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema , hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative , more ugly , more uninteresting , more lacking in suspense , more lacking in charm , more greedy , more incoherent . . . Okay , okay . I'll stop with the superlative negatives . Surely there have been worse , and , yes , off the top of my head , I can think of many that are worse . However , for a book that over 125 million people have read , and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history , and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises , and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation , I am more than severely disappointed . I know that , had it not been so overhyped , it would have been just as bad . Now , however , my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come . I go into an in depth criticism , but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words . There is hardly a piece of it that I liked . As a film , it was poorly edited , poorly acted ( by most ) , poorly filmed . The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom , although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever . The Quidditch game , which has been hyped to all heaven , is completely boring and poorly created . It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop . When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film , Christopher Columbus , who , I must say , lives up to his reputation completely , begins to edit furiously . I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13 . My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game , no matter how exciting it might have been . I'm still not sure which story to buy . But the person I really want to tear into is J . K . Rowling . What a hack . Never has the word "" hack "" been more fitting . A former waitress , her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names . Only in the mind of a psychopath ( or idiot ) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever . Writing children's literature is not difficult , but this is simply awful . She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow , especially in the exposition . The game of Quidditch , which seems to be a drawing point of some sort , is absolutely nonsensical . As a preteen , I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces . Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time , unless someone catches a special type of ball , which ends the game immediately . So theoretically , the game could end in thirty seconds . And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all . And let's talk about the surprise climax . Really , anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end . It is tremendously unclever . And the penultimate sequence , where the crown is awarded to the best dorm , is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin , We only hate one of them , so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them , and then is cruelly snatched away . And what about Hogwart , anyways ? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart , why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways ? Friends , you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons . If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures , make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C . S . Lewis . This is the most soulless garbage imaginable . And I thought Shrek had taken that title .

Text2: SPOILERSI'm not exactly sure I get Fanny and Alexander . On the surface , it looks most like yet another dig , the ultimate dig , at the Protestantism with which Bergman was tortured as a child ( his father was a clergyman ) . But there're also some other things , or so it would seem . I really like all the scenes with the big , extended family and their servants , who are nearly equal to their employers . I don't know what Bergman's point is with this stuff , but it's excellent . Fanny and Alexander begins with this family's Christmas celebration . Soon afterwards , Alexander's father dies . A bishop consoles the mother and eventually proposes to her . When the family moves in with the bishop , they realize all to late that he is a cruel and evil man , a slavedriver whose punishments far exceed the crimes . This part of the film , which is probably the longest , is also the weakest . Edvard , the bishop , is so evil he's reminiscent of the emperor from Return of the Jedi , able to shoot bolts of lightning from his fingertips . I personally despise religion . It's the bane of the world , all religions . However , this wicked bishop seems far too easy . Other religious figures in Bergman films strike me as more interesting . For instance , Gunnar Bjornstrand's role in Winter Light . Finally the children and their mother escape from the bishop . The film's best scenes occur after the local moneylender ( played by the excellent Bergman regular Erland Josephson ) steals them away from Edvard . He brings them to his home , where he and his son Aaron make marionettes . All of these scenes are extremely frightening , especially when Alexander runs into the moneylender's other son , Ishmael , a hermaphroditic shut-in with supernatural powers . The final act brings the family back together ( and kills off Edvard and the rest of his family ) , but there is an enormously uneasy feeling about the whole situation .

Text2: ' Yellow Jack ' is a goodish , proficiently made Hollywood drama which is weakened by several poor artistic decisions , and rendered absolutely ludicrous by one especially bad decision ( which I'll describe presently ) . The film deals with an inspiring true story in medical history , namely the attempts of the U . S . Army Medical Corps to find a cure for malaria , also known as yellow fever and ' yellow jack ' . This disease , spread by mosquitos , was so virulent in tropical regions that it seriously hampered the efforts to build the Panama Canal , as well as similar endeavours in Cuba and elsewhere . I'm only slightly familiar with the facts of this story , so I can't say how accurate this movie is . However , some of the actors in this cast are playing actual historic figures . . . notably the underrated Jonathan Hale as Major-General Leonard Wood , the officer in charge of the U . S . Army Yellow Fever Commission . Also excellent here is MGM stalwart Lewis Stone as Major Walter Reed , and Frank Puglia ( whom I usually dislike ) as Aristides Agramonte . Less impressive is Henry Hull , trying hard to be a serious "" ack-torr "" instead of portraying a believable character . Hull is cast as Jesse William Lazear , a physician who - - in real life - - deliberately infected himself by allowing ' loaded ' mosquitos to transmit the malaria virus to him . Hull's performance makes Lazear look ridiculous rather than heroic . The film takes place in Cuba in 1900 , hard upon the Spanish-American War . Dr Wood and his staff have found a potential treatment for malaria , but must test it on human subjects . Although one might expect Dr Wood to be the central character in this medical drama , the screenplay oddly emphasises one of his test subjects . ( This is one of the bad decisions which I've mentioned , but not the worst of them . ) Five medical volunteers are found ; the de-facto leader of these is played by Robert Montgomery , as an Irish-American trooper named John O'Hara . Is Montgomery playing an actual historic personage ? If not , it seems a strange decision for his character to be named John O'Hara , as this is the name of a best-selling novelist who was already well-known in 1938 . There are the usual Hollywood monkeyshines with history , notably in the casting of Virginia Bruce as an army nurse . An extremely beautiful blonde with great sex appeal but very little acting ability , Virginia Bruce is usually someone I'm delighted to see on the screen . Here , however , I find her beauty distracting . I can't believe that any woman as glammed-up as this would have been working as an army nurse in 1900 . During Louis B Mayer's reign as head of MGM , the studio had a firm policy that no leading lady would be depicted in an unglamorous manner . So , we get nonsense like this with army nurses getting the glamour treatment . No matter how steamy the swamps of Cuba might get , Virginia Bruce's mascara never wilts . She has a couple of very beautiful close-ups here . . . but that beauty works against the plausibility of this story . One of Montgomery's fellow guinea pigs , played by Buddy Ebsen , is a feller named Jelly Beans . I found this nickname hugely implausible . Did jelly beans even exist in 1900 ? Even if they did , ' Yellow Jack ' takes place largely in a military compound under military discipline : surely Ebsen's character would be referred to by his name or his rank , not some twee nickname . Ebsen was a talented character actor , but here he's been given a badly-written aw-shucks role , and he just can't make the character credible . The supremely bad decision was made by whoever decided that Montgomery should play his role with an Irish accent . Did I say Irish ? I meant ' Oirish ' . Montgomery's begorrah brogue is so full of Killarney blarney that it damages any plausibility in his characterisation , as well as the performances of other cast members in his scenes . Here we have a true story that ought to be dramatic and gripping on its own merits , yet Montgomery and Ebsen - - and , to a lesser extent , Henry Hull and Andy Devine - - are walking about with big red neon signs over their heads , flashing the words ' FICTIONAL CHARACTER ' . On the positive side , ' Yellow Jack ' features some extremely impressive montages by the brilliant Slavko Vorkapich . They belong in a better film .

Columbo is also one of the most intelligent characters on television as well . He doesn't dumb down his suspects or the audience . So this episode was indeed worth watching because of Faye Dunaway's performance . I think she is one of the best American actresses around today . She won an Emmy award for her performance in this film . Faye always has class and style . Her character is equally delicious to watch as she does what she does . I won't spoil the plot . It's great for Faye Dunaway fans and it shows that older women are more like fine wine . I wish Faye would do more acting but they would cast her in grandmother roles rather than the seductive , sensual woman that she exhibits on screen . She is one of America's legends on screen and she should be still working . She has talent , beauty , and intelligence .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: I watch a lot of scary and violent stuff but I've never felt uncomfortable with that . THIS is the only movie so far that terrified me ! ! I suffer from a really bad form of "" vertigo "" and around the time this movie got released in the theaters , I even felt sick when I was looking at the poster . It felt like a combination of my two biggest fears : heights and being frozen to death . Even though some of my favorite actors star in Vertical Limit , it took me quite long before I finally got the courage to watch it . The story of Vertical Limit is typical and there isn't anything original about it all . That's fine with me , I just considered it to be an old-fashioned adventure movie with good acting and stunning photography . Vertical Limit is the typical story of siblings who lost their father in a climbing accident . Ever since , the son ( Chris O'Donnel ) has stopped climbing . His sister ( Robin Tunney ) hasn't she's going to conquer K2 with the rich Texas guy Vaughn ( Bill Paxton ) . Of course , this goes wrong and Chris has to set up a rescue missing to go and save his sister . A whole bunch of typical characters are introduced and everything that can possibly go wrong , does go wrong . The quality level of Vertical Limit is merely held up by the acting performances . . . and more specifically : Scott Glenn and Bill Paxton . Both these overtalented - yet underappreciated - actors are cast perfectly . Glenn is impressive as the mysterious loner Montgomery Wick who dwells around K2 and Paxton is the worst kind of "" bad guy "" a movie can have . He isn't really the villain but he's the arrogant business guy who quickly turns into a selfish , egocentric and mad person who's willing to sacrifice everything to survive . Terrific performance . All the other aspects you expect are there as well . A developing love story , funny one-liners and the oversentimental morality and happy ending . Mainstream stuff but certainly not bad . Enjoyable and recommended to fans of beautiful landscapes .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

This low-budget Universal entry is easily one of the best of the Universal features co-starring BASIL RATHBONE and NIGEL BRUCE . Bruce is especially funny as he decides to do some investigating himself , with amusing false clues leading him astray . Rathbone is completely suave and relaxed as Holmes , less snappy than usual in the way he treats Watson and much more likable in the role than he has been in other entries . The plot abounds with the usual assortment of suspicious characters , but of all the supporting players ALAN MOBRAY is the one who stands out as the man who befriends Watson . Despite the low-budget trimmings and overuse of miniatures to show a train racing through the fog at night , the story is taut and the whole affair is intriguing enough to keep you watching until the unusual ending - - where a double twist is completely unexpected .

He's not just unlikable ; he's despicable , terrifying , sick , twisted , and ultimately a haunting embodiment of all our greatest realistic fears and worries . But Alex does not see himself as a sick person . The key to this is in his voice-over narrative . Alex does not see himself as a pervert , just as we do not see our own flaws and Ramond Babbitt did not see his own autism . To us , we are all normal , which is a scary thought . "" A Clockwork Orange , "" which was originally released in 1973 after an appeal for an R rating ( that was granted after originally being tagged as an X-rated motion picture ) , had been banned from Britain for close to thirty years . Most film fans in Europe will tell you that they had seen the movie on grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young and curious . But for those of us lucky enough to enjoy ( or squirm through ) "" A Clockwork Orange "" in its entire odd splendor , it is an experience you are likely to never forget . Its characters , its style , its subject matter , its explicit material - - all of it combines to create a marvelous whole that will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling . Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him , "" A Clockwork Orange "" is indeed as offbeat as its title . All tales of redemption involve characters that we gradually come to appreciate , or like , or - - at the very least - - learn to tolerate . Not "" A Clockwork Orange . "" Our narrator remains the same throughout the movie , always an incarnation of everything wrong in today's modern world . He goes through no cleansing process and by the end of the film we like him less than we did at the beginning . That's daring .

901,"Text1: Say hello to what is perhaps Lynch's greatest achievement so far . And , with a career like his , that sure does mean something . Every film he made is a remarkable and valuable asset to cinema - masterpieces in their own kind - and Blue Velvet is the absolute highlight for sure . Blue Velvet is the representation of the ' small town'-nightmare , complete with raw drama aspects and shocking realism . Without even trying that hard , Lynch successfully mixes a bunch of taboo subjects here like voyeurism , masochism , corruption , aggression and sodomy . The basic plot might look surprisingly simple , but Lynch tells it to the viewer in a very slow and fascinating way . constantly adding one new element at the time . This simple but effective style instrument really builds up an unbearable tension and a unique morbid atmosphere . Lynch already showed a lot of interest towards the dark side of humanity in his black and white cult film Eraserhead , and he expands this bizarre preference in Blue Velvet . Like no other director , he creates a nightmarish and anti-social universe of which you certainly don't want to be a part of . The most extravagant icon is without a doubt the character of Frank Booth . easily the biggest bastard who ever appeared on the big screen . Amazingly brought to life by Dennis Hopper , this mad mobster is the portrayal of everything that is inhuman and despicable . Every word that comes out of Frank's mouth is either aggressive . or perverted . He's a violent and abusive addict who doesn't seem to have the slightest bit of human emotions or behavior . Dennis Hopper owns this movie and leaves behind the biggest impression you'll ever experience . Blue Velvet contains so many memorable sequences and unforgettable aspects that it's almost impossible to write a summary . Also , it would be a darn shame to spoil anything . The less you know about it before watching , the better . Let ' Blue Velvet ' overwhelm you . rate it on this site . and join the fan-base ! One scene I'm willing to describe a little ( if it were only to encourage you to watch this film ) is Dean Stockwell's terrific little escapade on Roy Orbison's ' In Dreams ' It's impossible to watch this scene without getting cold shivers all over , I assure you . Perhaps the most stunning and atmospheric sequence in all 80's cinema . What are you waiting for ? ! ? Go out and buy Blue Velvet on DVD !

Plus , it was a WWII American propaganda film that tried to mobilize the public against the Nazi menace - - just the sort of film I usually love . But , instead of the menacing and almost inhuman enemy , this movie took a more cerebral look at the enemy and presented a much more restrained look at the Nazis . In the process , they also made an "" action "" movie with hardly any action and A LOT of talking . The end result was certainly watchable , but not exactly interesting or worth my time . It will surely sound low-brow , but I got very tired of John Garfield being so pleasant - - I wanted to see him shoot some of the bad guys . But , again and again , the action just didn't heat up .

Text2: Stan and Ollie are in prison and are constantly trying to escape . The problem is that they are idiots and every plan they try fails . Some of them are pretty funny and some a bit too silly in this film . This is one of the earlier Laurel and Hardy films , so I'm cutting it a bit of slack in scoring it a 6 . The problem is that this prison comedy , while funny , also has a couple bits where the timing is just awful and they milk gags way too long - - something you'd never see in their later and more polished films . The first of these over-long bits is when prisoners Stan and Ollie try to escape by pretending to be painters . When a guard becomes suspicious and follows them out of the prison , they start painting EVERYTHING in sight . When I was a kid and saw this , I thought it was hilarious . Now , as an adult , it just seemed stupid - - and NOT in a good way ! The second was the awful dining scene where Stan chases a cherry all around the table with his spoon . This "" funny "" bit was often seen in films before this with other comics and it just isn't funny - - and it goes on and on far too long .

As the world around them manifests into a literal hell-on-earth , the horrified citizens try desperately to survive this apocalyptic disaster . . the good thing about this very tense , taut , thriller is that it doesn't focus too much on the beasts that are surrounding the supermarket . what we get is an insight into what people will do to survive , whether or not their belief in faith is justified , or should it be every man for themselves ? the party in the supermarket segregate between the believers ( led by a sinister Marcia gay Harden ) and the people who want to survive ( ultimately led by Jane ) . at eleven minutes in to the film the tension really begins with a lone man running into the supermarket declaring ' they've taken John Lee !

905,"Text1: After "" The Matrix "" there were a lot of movies who suddenly ignored the fact that there is actually a thing such as gravity . "" Romeo Must Die "" was one of the first mainstream movies to feature this , after "" The Matrix "" . To me it gives the movie more of a fake look rather than a spectacular one though . It's definitely a movie made for the MTV-generation . It's a noisy , fast movie with different songs like every 1 minute , that often don't even blend in with what's happening on the screen . It's like they had a quota of a certain amount of songs they had to put in the movie . Most of the songs are already sounding outdated by now , so just imaging how this movie would be like to watch in 10 years from now . Seems to me that all this Aaliyah gushing comes from the fact that she died in a plane crash one year after this movie . But lets be fair and objective for one moment , she just wasn't a very great actress . It's of course always a horrible thing when a person dies so young and under such horrible circumstances but it ain't exactly like James Dean has died here or anything like that . This movie was her acting debut and it was the only movie that got released during her lifetime . Let's not even get started on Jet Li . . . I already knew he just isn't a great actor and the only thing that gets him movie roles are of course his fighting skills , which certainly aren't lacking as much as his acting abilities . I'm getting kind of fed up with this great black actors appearing in these sort of productions , just because it's a ' black ' production and they are helping their brothers out . I mean come on Delroy Lindo can get and certainly also deserves better roles in better movies than this . He's potentially an Oscar winner but he obviously won't ever win one if he decided to go on and play roles in movies such as this one . Same thing to a lesser extend somewhat also goes for Isaiah Washington . None of the characters really work out because of the messy storytelling , in which a main plot only gets vaguely visible not until halve way through . Lots of characters seem to be redundant and the movie seems to have a hard time keeping its main focus on one thing and one main character . But oh well when you have an actor such as Jet Li playing the main role , you of course also can't really trust on it to let him carry the entire movie on his own . But also just the story on its own is hardly anything interesting and seems to be very typical for an action movie such as this one . Perhaps its also due to the fact that Andrzej Bartkowiak was still an inexperienced director that the movie did not worked out so well , especially story-wise . This was actually the first movie he did as a director . Bartkowiak mostly got his fame for working as a director of photography on mostly well known action movies such as "" Speed "" , "" Lethal Weapon 4 "" and other fine movies such as "" The Devil's Advocate "" , "" Terms of Endearment "" and "" Species "" . Seems like the Polish born Bartkowiak has completely retired from camera-work now to completely focus on his directing career . With movies such as "" Exit Wounds "" , "" Cradle 2 the Grave "" , "" Doom "" and this one behind his name he hasn't had much success with it yet though . I was also expecting some more action from this movie , also not in the least since it had Jet Li in the main role . But because the movie has a hard time keeping its focus and let things evolve around the Jet Li character , he actually gets far too little to do action wise . I was just expecting some more good fight sequences from the movie , although the movie of course obviously still features action moments like this . The movie was just not like I was expecting it to be and it also had actually very little romance in it . I was sort of expecting more of a modern Romeo and Juliet type of story ( like the movie its title also would suggest ) but instead the movie is more about some rivaling gangs and the NFL . . . do I need to say more ? Bad story flow , bad character handling , disappointing action and below par acting performances from most of the cast . Just an overall bad movie !

Bruno's idea of making a living consists of supplementing Sonia's State help with petty crime and spending the money as fast as he makes it . His new-born son is just something else off which he can make money .

The plot is set in motion when U-boat commander Conrad Veidt is given a mission to infiltrate English security in the Orkneys , a cue for us to cut to that locale . The next sequence is almost beyond parody . A young girl is leaving an inn to take up a post as a schoolteacher on a small island ; for the sake of exposition she is obliged to explain this to the landlady who is seeing her off and throw in the additional information that she has obtained both a passport and a Visa . At this juncture an elderly matron turns up in a chauffeur driven car and asks for a room . For no reason other than to move the plot forward she is immediately put in the picture about the schoolteacher which prompts her to offer to drive her to the ferry . En route - and in a time of War and ultra high security - the girl not only reveals that she has a passport but actually PRODUCES it , whereby she is chloroformed by the elderly party so that substitute , in the shape of Valerie Hobson , may take her place . In the fullness of one reel Hobson is installed in the schoolteacher's cottage and has rendez-voused with Veidt ; the plan is for a team of U-boats to assemble and sink half the British fleet at Scapa Flow with the help of a disgruntled Royal Navy Officer . Of course what transpires is the equivalent of ' it was all a dream ' ; the disgruntled Navy type , Sebastian Shaw is really a counter-spy as is Hobson and THEIR plan is to lure as many U-boats as possible into the area then drop a few dozen depth-charges where they will do the most good .

The animation is both haunting and beautiful in many places . The characters are appealing when they concern the "" wind-ups "" and some forest animals and suitably creepy when displaying most of the rats . The story seems simple but some characters go on tangents about life that threatens to become pretentious after a while though that happens only for a few minutes . Not much of humor happens here though it was amusing hearing Frank Nelson as a crow , Andy Devine ( in his last role ) as a frog , and Cloris Leachman as , I think , a bird . I was pleasantly surprised to see in the end credits that of Charles Schulz Creative Associates as one of the companies involved . Oh , and one of the wonderfully weirdest scenes involved seeing the Bosco can show the dog posed with a picture of him looking the same in position ad infinitum ( to illustrate infinity ) . On that note , I guess that's a recommendation for The Mouse and His Child .

The Martian scheme is going as planned until the Martian leader named Dop begins to fall for an Earth woman . His infatuation with the woman puts the entire Martian plan in question . Those crazy days of political incorrectness that were the 60s . It was a time when a movie about the abduction and rape of a group of women could be considered "" family "" entertainment . It was a time when a doctor specializing in space medicine was known first and foremost as a "" stunning brunette "" . She even insists on calling herself a "" pretty girl with a PhD "" . It certainly was a very different age . For a movie that stars Tommy Kirk and Yvonne Craig , I was expecting something along the lines of an intergalactic beach movie . I expected something light-hearted and fun . Mars Needs Women couldn't be much further from fun if it tried . It's too serious for its own good . So instead of fun , the movie dishes up a heaping helping of boredom . The whole concept behind the movie is too silly to attempt to play it this straight . Everyone involved needed to lighten up . Had they done so , Mars Needs Women might not have been so terribly dull ? and bad .

She's suddenly a wealthy woman about to be wed to the man of her dreams , George Hastings ( John Agar ) . But she learns something else . She learns her father's secret . She discovers she is the daughter of the infamous Dr . Jekyll . And she begins having vivid nightmares of killing people in the most horrible of ways . She wakes to find herself covered in blood , her clothes torn , and her shoes muddy . Has she somehow inherited a dark , split-personality from her father that turns her into a snarling maniac ? For anyone who has seen both Daughter of Dr . Jekyll and Universal's She-Wolf of London , am I alone in comparing the two ? I hate to give too much away about either movie , but there's no denying the similarities ? two women about to be married , both under the impression that they turn into killers when the moon is full , slowly being driven mad , yet neither is responsible for the acts they are accused . It's too much of a coincidence to be just dumb luck . Oddly enough , though , I prefer Daughter of Dr . Jekyll to She-Wolf of London . It's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination , but it is slightly more enjoyable to me than the earlier movie . Chief among the reasons that I prefer this movie is the female lead . June Lockhart is one of my biggest complaints with She-Wolf of London . Gloria Talbott is far more believable in the similar role . My biggest complaint with Daughter of Dr . Jekyll is the changes it makes to the Jekyll / Hyde storyline . Hyde is now referred to as a werewolf that had to be staked through the heart to kill him . Huh ? So now he's some sort of werewolf / vampire creature ? News to me ! And I never quite understood how his daughter was supposed to have inherited his "" curse "" . Wasn't Dr .

Instead you have a film based in the time of the American Civil War , with not much gore at all , and to honest , I was only interested in it for the stars and gore . Basically Capt . John Boyd ( Memento's Guy Pearce ) gets promoted , but when Gen . Slauson ( John Spencer ) discovers his cowardice , he decides instead to send him to Fort Spencer , where he is third in command of a bunch of men , including Pvt . Cleaves ( Scream's David Arquette ) , Pvt . Toffler ( Secretary's Jeremy Davies ) and Col . Hart ( Beetle Juice's Jeffrey Jones ) . As they travel they come across wounded Scottish stranger F . W .

Boyd is the only victim left alive escaping him , but when he gets back to the civilisation of the General , he is shocked to see him again , as Col . Ives . But it is not just Carlyle that might be the cannibal , Boyd had temptations ( or possibly did ) to eat people , and Carlyle is trying to tempt him , but in the end they both die together , after a quite long fight , in a giant bear trap . I suppose in some ways it was inventive , but it just isn't the cannibal based horror film I was expecting . Worth watching !

Text2: Three years after Francis Ford Coppola brought out his version of Bram Stoker's classic story , director Mel Brooks ( The Producers , Young Frankenstein ) brought us this terrible spoof of the two or three successful versions . It is the same basic story , R . M . Renfield ( Peter MacNicol ) goes to the castle in Transylvania , to finish the deal with Count Dracula ( Leslie Nielsen ) to buy Carfax Abbey . Dracula turns him into his servant , and they go to London , England , where the dark lord wants to devour all the blood from ( rich ) English women he can . After an attack on Lucy Westenra ( Lysette Anthony ) , Dr . Abraham Van Helsing ( Brooks ) is brought in to try and help solve the mystery of the strange markings on her neck , and he is sure it is a vampire attack . Van Helsing , along with Jonathan Harker ( Steven Weber ) and Dr . Jack Seward ( Harvey Korman ) are determined to make sure Mina Murray ( The Mask's Amy Yasbeck ) doesn't meet the same fate . Obviously they do find out Dracula is the vampire , and that Renfield is his servant , and they are now all brought together in the final showdown . The fact that Brooks fails to create the same quality of horror spoofing he did with Young Frankenstein , is a little embarrassing . Nielsen may have the accent , but no real presence , MacNicol may have a better English accent than Keanu Reeves did , but he is still an idiotic character , and as for the jokes , only the ones involving blood going everywhere gets the tiniest giggle from me , the rest are cheap and boring .

913,"Text1: The Browning / Lugosi ' classic ' has always been one of my favorite Universal horror films but , ever since the simultaneously-produced ' rival ' Spanish version resurfaced , the ' original ' has taken a beating by fans and historians alike - mainly because the latter features superior camera-work ! This , however , is the ONLY area where it can lay a claim to be better in when compared to the US version ( the fact that leading lady Lupita Tovar had a sexier wardrobe than Helen Chandler shouldn't even be considered , I guess ) . Still , the fact that on the DVD the opinion that the seminal US version is the inferior one seems to be shared by quite a few people hasn't done it any favors ! I remember being impressed by the Spanish version when I first watched it in 2001 , singling out for praise the performance of Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield and , of course , George Robinson's cinematography . However , coming back to it now , I felt that Rubio's hysterical rendering of the character ( which reminded me of Gene Wilder in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN [ 1974 ] of all people ! ) was nowhere nearly as nuanced as Dwight Frye's unforgettable characterization in the US version . Regarding the "" superior camera-work "" , I guess this is true for individual sequences ( Dracula's introduction , for instance ) but , frankly , I never felt that Karl Freund - a pioneer of the moving camera - had somehow been restrained by Tod Browning , who admittedly wasn't very fond of this technique . Given that of late we've also been faced by the ridiculous assumption that Browning didn't actually direct the film , he couldn't have - since he wasn't even there ! ! It may be however , that since frequent Browning collaborator Lon Chaney ( who had been slated for the title role ) died before shooting began , the director sort of lost heart in the project - coupled also with the fact that the script was rather talky , another element with which Browning felt uneasy ! Well , whatever went on behind the scenes , for me what's in front remains one of the highlights of the American horror film - from the marvelous dialogue ( especially as delivered - each in their own unique way - by Lugosi , Frye and Edward Van Sloan ) , irreproachable performances ( Frye and Van Sloan were at their best , while Lugosi only ever really came close with THE BLACK CAT [ 1934 ] and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN [ 1939 ] ) and memorable individual scenes ( the entire first act set in Transylvania , the confrontation scenes between Dracula and his nemesis Professor Van Helsing , Renfield's various ravings ) . The tame ending may appear anti-climactic to most people but I honestly was never bothered by it ! If anything , this was remedied in any number of ways in subsequent outings . . . Which brings us back to the Spanish Dracula : like I said , the film is an interesting and altogether pleasing ' alternate ' to the Lugosi version . . . but it is fatally compromised by the inadequate leading performance of Carlos Villarias , whose bulging eyes and feral snarls can't hold a candle to Lugosi's definitive screen vampire ! This version does go to places where the American doesn't ( Browning shies away from the vampire attacks , for instance ) and even features ' new ' scenes like the aftermath of the vampiric Lucy's demise - but , at 104 minutes ( a full half-hour longer than the US version , when considering that they were following the same script ! ) it's way overlong for its own good . The Browning / Lugosi version is often criticized for its sluggishness but this one actually moves at a snail's pace : take , for instance , the famous scene where Dracula is exposed by the mirror - Lugosi knocks the box down immediately , while Villarias takes forever to do so ( even if his resolution is effectively flamboyant nonetheless ) . A word about the DVD quality : disappointingly , the Spanish version features closed-captions ( for the hearing-impaired ) rather than proper subtitles . As for the US version , the print utilized for this particular transfer ( which differs from that of the original , and more satisfactory , 1999 release ) is a bit too dark for my taste and the dialogue sometimes was hard to catch due to the incessant hiss on the soundtrack ! It also reverts to the ' original ' single groan during Dracula's staking ( instead of the elongated variant available on the earlier disc ) . . . but does feature a bit of music at the end of the Opera sequence , which had been missing from the previous edition ! ! Well , this only means that it's worth keeping both copies of Dracula as neither is really definitive . . .

Text2: Although I have been aware of this film for a long time , it was only after watching its amusing theatrical trailer – on THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT ( 1970 ) DVD – that I became eager to watch it . The end result proved to be a patchy affair but , nevertheless , it does have its fair share of belly-laughs and , in any case , watching Streisand in kooky mode is always fun ; Estelle Parsons and William Redfield are her hubby ( Michael Sarrazin ) ’s well-to-do and snobbish relatives who particularly look down on Streisand . It clearly emulates the screwball style of WHAT’S UP , DOC ? ( 1972 ) , parodies THE FRENCH CONNECTION ( 1971 ) – the underground station cat-and-mouse chase between Gene Hackman and Fernando Rey is performed here by a disguised Streisand and a persistent police dog ! – and it also homages Buster Keaton’s GO WEST ( 1925 ) in the urban cow stampede sequence and Luis Bunuel’s BELLE DE JOUR ( 1967 ) in the role-playing encounters during Streisand’s disastrous stint as a call-girl ! British action director Yates was surprisingly roped in for this , but he seems to have enjoyed the experience as his next project was on similarly zany lines – the black comedy MOTHER , JUGS AND SPEED ( 1976 ; which I’ll be watching presently ) . Another notable sequence sees the heroine involved , unbeknownst to her , in terrorist activity ( she’s asked to deliver a package in disguise to a similarly-dressed woman ) – which eventually rebounds on her shady brother employers ! Similarly , one of the best lines has Streisand’s nonchalant black maid ( she hires a Hispanic woman to do her own cleaning-up ! ) who , admiring the former’s tenacity , tells her : "" Girl , you could even sell a Confederate flag in Harlem !

The good count is resurrected that very night by loyal servant Klove ( Philip Latham ) and proceeds to terrorize the locals all over again . Although it took some convincing to get Lee to reprise the role , it was worth the wait ( a sort-of sequel named "" The Brides of Dracula "" had been released in between ) . He plays Dracula with utter , mesmerizing menace and the silence of the character makes him much more animal-like ( although , in truth , Lee played the role silent because he thought Draculas ' dialog was abysmal ) . The other actors do fine in support ; as is always the case for Hammer shockers , the ladies present are quite lovely and bewitching , especially Farmer , who also had the additional task of dubbing Shelleys ' screams . Andrew Keir is a solid standout as the gruff , no-nonsense Father Sandor , who proves to be very helpful indeed . The film is quite atmospheric , with darkness effectively blanketing many shots . Nicely shot in Technovision by Michael Reed , with appropriate sets by Bernard Robinson . James Bernard supplies one of his many ominous , grandiose , and unsettling music scores . Genuinely spooky from beginning to end , there's some wonderful suspense to be enjoyed here , as well as some decent effects .

Text2: Jim Henson as a filmmaker sometimes doesn't get as much credit as for his main innovations with the Muppets and establishing them throughout the years as the head producer of the Henson company . But behind the genius puppeteer that he was , he was also very good at creating a style that was all his own , whether it was with the original and enlightening fantasy films he made in the 80s or with the Muppet movies . Part of what crosses over from his time with the Muppets with this rarely seen short film , Time Piece , is the pure sense of tongue placed firmly in cheek . The theme of time is one that many art films deal with ( not the least of which Bergman ) , but this film is like a collaboration between the crazier silent shorts of the 1920s and Chuck Jones . I laughed many times during this film , but it's also a marvel of - of course - timing , but also at getting the right rhythm with the images . It goes without saying that its directness in the editing , with its tempo always on step without going overboard , is some of the best I've ever seen in a short film . Little moments end up making the best parts of Henson's film , where no real story emerges aside of himself sort of being witness to the follies of the world in a very crazy manner . And it's also an exercise in repetition - a few times the one spoken word of the film pops up ( "" Help "" ) - by Henson , and it's always very funny . But the comic timing is explored in little themes Henson had in later films , such as food , with one of the real laugh out loud bits being when Henson and the woman eat at the table as they one-up each other . Or seeing the delirious pathway in Henson running around towards the end ( being chased , no doubt , by archive footage ) . It all ends then , to put it mildly , down the toilet ( literally I mean ) . This is a surprising film with as much invention that can be fused cinematically into its concept - showing time as being very musical in a sense , and possibly breaking the balance that it usually keeps with day to day life . It's an early gem , and its quite a stroke of luck to find it on-line or through a rare 16mm print ; one of the true unfortunates in being unavailable to the masses and other fans of Henson .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: This was a tough movie to follow because the sound was so poor . It had the feel of a 1950's ' B ' Western making it hard to imagine it was made as late as 1963 . That would explain Jock Mahoney's aged appearance since his 1958 TV series "" Yancy Derringer "" , flourishes of which we see in the character of Don Michael O'Casey . Here he shows some of that Yancy charisma with the ladies , along with the stunt riding skills that made him a hit as Range Rider in the early Fifties . Set in 1842 California , the story revolves around the question of that territory's statehood . Don Francisco Hernandez ( Michael Pate ) has allied himself with General Miguel Torena against that prospect in the hopes of becoming it's first Mexican governor . His romantic ambitions call for a marriage to a woman who doesn't love him , Marianna De La Rosa ( Susan Seaforth ) , who in turn finds she has feelings for the handsome renegade Don Mike . There's also a woman in the middle , Carlotta Torres , who does love Francisco , but realizes that he's an evil and ambitious man . Though the viewer finds himself siding with the cause of ' Viva Hernandez ' , it's a tenuous position since the film builds little in the way of sympathy for one side or the other . Don Francisco's hopes for power are crushed when the General confesses that he's on the outs with his superiors in Mexico City , and when Irish Mexican O'Casey defeats him in a sword duel , he knows enough to call it quits . Until he makes a run for it , and is gunned down by a Hernandez loyalist . Oh yeah , Don Francisco was Michael O'Casey's uncle , but it's not that important . There's really little to recommend this film other than an offbeat treat for fans of Jacques / Jack / Jock O'Mahoney . Though as mentioned earlier , you'll be watching an older Yancy putting his spell on the ladies as he finds a way to outwit the bad guys .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
916,"Text1: Billy Fisher , a bone idle young clerk at Shadrach & Duxbury's Funeral Emporium in the provincial Northern town of Stradhoughton , escapes from his humdrum life by retreating into a fantasy world of his own making , which he calls Ambrosia . Every person in Ambrosia looks like him . He has plenty of reasons for wanting to escape from reality ; his father ( Wilfrid Pickles ) is a bullying tyrant , his mother ( Mona Washbourne ) a right nag , and his grandmother ( Ethel Griffies ) , who lives with them , is senile . Billy's boss is the creepy Mr . Shadrach ( Leonard Rossiter ) , who organises funeral processions as though they were wartime bombing raids . Billy cannot open his mouth without uttering a lie . He is engaged to two girls ; the prissy ' Barbara ' ( Helen Fraser ) and loud Rita ( Gwendolyn Watts ) . They do not know of each other's existence , meaning he has to constantly ferry the engagement ring back and forth . The one bright spot in his life is Liz ( Julie Christie ) , a free-spirited young woman whom Billy is secretly mad for . The scene where she walks along swinging her handbag without a care in the world became an iconic moment of ' 60's British cinema . Believing he has landed a job writing gags for television comedian Danny Boon ( Leslie Randall ) , Billy hands in his notice . But his old life is not about to let him go so easily . . . One of the best British comedy films of the ' 60's ( and of all time ! ) , ' Billy Liar ' came out as the vogue for kitchen-sink dramas ( which included ' Saturday Night & Sunday Morning ' , ' A Taste Of Honey ' , and ' The Loneliness Of The Long-Distance Runner ' , the latter also starring Tom Courtenay ) was ending , and escapist entertainment ( such as the James Bond series ) making a comeback . It resembles a kitchen-sink drama for much of the time , but when we least expect it we are plunged into Billy's fantasy world . In the midst of having a shave in the kitchen , for instance , Billy suddenly turns into an armed soldier and wipes out his family . Then reality returns and the story continues as before . Moments such as that account for much of the humour , although it comes from other directions too , such as Billy and Arthur Crabtree ( future ' Likely Lad ' Rodney Bewes ) walking through the town centre and talking nonsense in broad Northern accents . ' Billy Liar ' started life as a book by Keith Waterhouse , became a play ( with Willis Hall's help ) , then a film , stage musical , and television sitcom . But its as a film which for me is its most enjoyable incarnation . Like John Schelesinger's previous movie ' A Kind Of Loving ' , it overflows with period interest . Godfrey Winn and ' Housewives ' Choice ' . Old buildings being demolished . The opening of a new supermarket . The Locarno dance hall . Milk machines ( I remember those ! ) . Old people shocked to find Pakistanis working on buses . From this film you get a strong sense of what the country was like in 1963 . Post-war Britain was coming to an end , and ' 60's Britain beginning to take shape . If all of this makes ' Billy Liar ' sound heavy-going , forget it . Its hilarious from start to finish . For instance , Billy's guilt at stealing money from his employers manifests itself in the form of a pseudo-crime movie with Billy as star , in which he goes to gaol and impresses the Governor by writing an expose of prison life entitled ' I Have Paid ! ' . I for one am glad that this film was made in black and white . Richard Rodney Bennett's music catches its mood perfectly . Tom Courtenay is the definitive ' Billy Fisher ' , a lying little swine ( as his dad refers to him ) but lovable . We the audience are his only friend , and are privileged to hear his innermost thoughts . His disappointment at getting the brush-off from Danny Boon is heartbreaking . You will cheer him on as he boards the train with Liz , intending to start a new life with her in London . Of course things do not go as expected and the finale is brilliant tragi-comedy . I won't bother to tell you how wonderful the supporting cast are . See for yourself . Leonard Rossiter does not get much to do but his performance as ' Mr . Shadrach ' is a little gem . He also appears in the film's funniest scene . I would not be so crass as to spoil it , but suffice to say it takes place in Shadrach's office , and involves a two-way radio . Watch it and weep with laughter . A film to watch over and over again . Oh , and the book's great too .

Text2: For donkey's years , the 5 . 35 weekday slot on B . B . C . - 1 was occupied by a five-minute cartoon that acted as a bridge from children's television to the early evening news . Off the top my head there was ' The Magic Roundabout ' , ' Willo The Wisp ' ( lovely narration by Kenneth Williams ) , ' Captain Pugwash ' , ' Ludwig ' ( possibly the most weird show of all time ! ) , ' Noah & Nelly In Skylark ' , and , of course , ' The Wombles ' . But my personal favourite was ' Roobarb ' which began in 1974 . It was the work of the brilliant animator Bob Godfrey , and as you would expect was completely off the wall . ' Roobarb ' was the name of the show's star , a vomit-coloured dog who lived in a garden along with ' Custard ' ( a shocking pink cat who spoke alarmingly like John Major ) , and some hyperactive birds . The plots usually followed a pattern - Roobarb would have a great idea , such as trying to fly with the aid of homemade wings , manufacturing fizzy lemonade , or becoming a great musician , retire to his shed to put his idea into practice , emerge triumphantly and the whole thing would then fall apart in seconds , much to the amusement of Custard and co . It was created and written by Grange Calveley , and often approached genius levels in its humour . Lines like ' sound travels at night . . . because its cheaper ! ' could have come out of ' The Goon Show ' . Richard Briers ' narration was perfectly delivered . When I watch repeats of ' The Good Life ' , I see something of Roobarb in the character of ' Tom Good ' . Both are doers , creatures of invention , determined to do things in a different way , who carry on regardless even if things do not always work out as planned . As this was made well before computers became commonplace in animation , it betrays its humble origins most delightfully . The whole thing looks like a child's drawings come to life . Because magic marker pens were used to create the illustrations , it resulted in an endearing ' wobble ' effect , giving the show much of its charm . Only one series was made , but its popularity kept it being repeated for years . In 2005 , a sequel - ' Roobarb & Custard Too ' - appeared . Though lacking Godfrey's involvement , it still proved enjoyable ( what a good year for reviving old shows that was , with ' Dr . Who ' and ' Captain Scarlet ' also being given new leases of life ) . I still enjoy repeats , if only for the sheer daftness of it all . And I must quickly mention Johnny Hawksworth's catchy theme tune , a masterpiece by itself ! "" And all the birds laughed !

And there's something extra appealing about a locked room type mystery . But Murder in Mesopotamia suffers from one hugely ridiculous plot point that I am completely unable to overlook . It's not really the fault of the makers of this adaptation - instead , I lay the blame squarely at Agatha Christie's original work . - BIG SPOILERS AHEAD ? Are we really supposed to believe that Mrs . Leidner could marry a man and not realize he was her supposedly dead first husband ? I cannot fathom something so far-fetched as this actually happening . I don't care how much his face has changed , I'm unwilling to take that kind of leap in logic . I've always thought it was one of the silliest things Christie ever wrote . Unless she was a complete idiot , surely Mrs . Leidner would have realized at some point that she had married the same man twice . ? END OF BIG SPOILERS

Text2: A jewel thief is brutally murdered on a train by a masked assailant . But when the murderer is unable to locate any diamonds , the murderer immediately suspects that the thief's daughter , a Parisian stripper named Nicole ( Nieves Navarro aka Susan Scott ) , may have the diamonds . Nicole , however , claims to know nothing of the diamonds . After a series of threats , both verbal and physical , Nicole decides to flee France with a man she hardly knows . The pair begin a seemingly ideal relationship in a secluded seaside village . But Nicole is unaware that the killer has followed her to England and will stop at nothing to get his hands on the diamonds . What a fun Giallo ! Death Walks on High Heels has one of the most convoluted plots I've run into ? even by Giallo standards . While the movie may lack the quantity of murder scenes found in other Gialli ( although at least one murder scene is as violent as they come ) , Death Walks on High Heels makes up for this shortcoming with more plot twists than a mountain road and boatload of red herrings . It had me guessing ( incorrectly , I might add ) up to the very end . It's all about the mystery and director Luciano Ercoli skillfully casts the shadow of suspicion on just about everyone in the cast . Much of the movie is told quite nicely in flashbacks with bits and pieces of the story being revealed as each person confesses to what they may or may not have seen . There's even a pair of bumbling Scotland Yard detectives who are ( surprise , surprise ) actually funny . Overall , Death Walks on High Heels is very well done . The acting is a notch or two above what I've come to expect in a Giallo . The highlight , at least for me , is Nieves Navarro . She is amazing as Nicole . I didn't think I would ever say this , but I think she might have been capable of challenging Edwige Fenech in my mind as the Queen of the Giallo had she made a few more of these movies . I'm looking forward to checking out more of her work . As much as I enjoyed Death Walks on High Heels , it's not without its flaws . Chief among them , at least to me , is a "" cheat "" with respect to one of the murders . I don't want to give anything away , but there is one particularly nasty murder that the killer could not have committed given the circumstances immediately following the murder . Hopefully , with repeat viewings , I can reconcile this point in my mind and just enjoy the movie for what it is . Finally , and I'm really starting to sound like a shill , NoShame's new DVD is fantastic . I would have never dreamed that a movie like Death Walks on High Heels would look this good .

918,"Text1:  Charlie Chan at Treasure Island  is at the top of many Chan fan lists as their favorite ; it certainly deserves that distinction . Even when the film gets creepy it's fun , as in the séance scene at the home of Dr . Zodiac . Charlie Chan's friend Paul Essex is an apparent suicide aboard a San Francisco bound plane flight . His suicide note - "" Can't escape Zodiac , Good Bye my Love , Paul "" . Charlie Chan ( Sidney Toler ) is warned not to investigate : "" Do not challenge the supernatural unless you are prepared to visit your ancestors . "" But investigate he does , and as usual we are introduced to a colorful cast of characters and suspects along the way . There's The Great Rhadini ( Cesar Romero ) , who challenges other magicians and psychics , his mind reading assistant Eve Cairo ( Pauline Moore ) , and insurance investigator Salsbury ( Douglas Dumbrille ) . Aiding Charlie on the case are Number # 2 Son Jimmy ( Victor Sen Yung ) and Deputy Chief Kilvaine ( Donald MacBride ) . Watch for a neat scene when Chan returns to the Zodiac home a second time - a black cat crosses his path . The twist to the story comes when we learn that Romero's character Rhadini is also Dr . Zodiac , blackmailing victims with secrets from their past . He even takes a knife to the shoulder during an on stage performance in an attempt to throw suspicion in a different direction . The film borrows from a Bela Lugosi trademark , piercing dark eyes attempting to overcome psychic Eve Cairo's thoughts while under Chan's influence to flush out the killer of Zodiac's Turkish servant . The film is set against the backdrop of the 1939 San Francisco World's Fair , Treasure Island being an attraction , along with the Century of Progress Exhibition . But as in most of the Charlie Chan films , the locale is secondary to the mystery , and this time it's a good one , with clever writing and just enough imagination to make you wonder whether mind reading might actually be real !

Text2: OK , so here's a question - who killed Ma Jarrett ? Big Ed ( Steve Cochran ) terrorizes Verna ( Virginia Mayo ) by stating that he'll tell Cody Jarrett ( James Cagney ) how she shot Ma in the back . But because Verna gets to Cody first , she tells him the same story , but with Big Ed the perpetrator . I believe most viewers of the film take it on faith that Verna did it , but I think the story leaves enough room to consider that it could have gone otherwise . In it's way , the movie creates the same kind of dichotomy as another of Cagney's famous gangster films , "" Angels With Dirty Faces "" . Did Rocky Sullivan die a yellow rat or did he do it for Father Jerry ? It can be endlessly debated , and depending on your point of view , either scenario is possible . That's one of the reasons this is such a great film . Certainly , it's one of Cagney's greatest performances , and he goes at it with gusto . The jail house mess scene when he learns Ma is dead is Cagney at his maniacal best , improvising as he goes leaving even director Raoul Walsh guessing where it's heading . One wonders if it's one of those headache attacks that Jarrett's suffered ever since his father died , or the actualization of a sentiment he later shares with inmate Pardo / Fallon ( Edmond O'Brien ) - "" Maybe I AM nuts "" . Hey , wasn't Margaret Wycherly great as Ma Jarrett ? Couldn't you just picture her in a Texas Death Match against Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West from "" The Wizard of Oz "" ? You believe it when she says of Big Ed - "" Anytime I can't handle his kind , I'll know I'm getting old . . . "" It's a testament to Cagney's portrayal that even as the film's protagonist , you don't identify with him enough to want to see him get away with it . He casually guns down a railroad engineer in an early scene because the man remembered and spoke Cody's name . Later he gives new meaning to the term ' ventilate ' when he airs out the stuffy trunk that contains Parker , one of Big Ed's inside men at the penitentiary . By the time the film builds up to the explosive finale , you come to see that Verna was right - you can pump him full of lead and he'll still keep coming at you . Say , did anyone make a connection when the radio broadcast of the train robbery made reference to the ' High Sierra ' tunnel ? That's another film that comes to mind when considering the great ones of the ' s gangster era , along with Edward G . Robinson's "" Little Caesar "" ( 1931 ) and Cagney's own earlier work , "" Public Enemy "" from the same year . Of them all , Cagney's Cody Jarrett is undeniably the most vicious and tortured villain of the lot .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2:  Shadow of a Doubt  may only be listed as # 181 on IMDb's "" Top 250 "" list , but in my opinion it far outweighs some of the films higher up on that list and is one of Hitch's very best films . Joseph Cotten plays Charlie , a crook on the run from the police . Left stranded and pursued , he decides to move in with his brother's family . His niece - who loves him and sees him as a sort of perfect role model - at first is excited that her Uncle Charlie is coming . . . but then things start to get strange . Charlie acts oddly and , at times , violent . She begins to become suspicious of her uncle as he becomes more suspicious of her own awareness . The ending of "" Shadow of a Doubt "" is classic Hitchcock and some of the best stuff he's done . The entire film is taut and suspenseful , well-filmed and realistic . It manages to focus on family ties and the struggles within the family itself while it also juggles the whole theme of an outcast family member . In the end , however , it's just a nail-biting thriller that - now over sixty years old - still reigns as one of the absolute best of its genre .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The others leave , but Taylor stays behind in his white suit and Panama hat and courts Lamarr , whose mixed racial background makes things difficult for her . For one thing , she can't get a passport . And although Taylor and Lamarr marry and love each other - - well , you can't live on the fruits of love . They run out of money and live in an exotic , run-down hotel so shabby that it resembles the hovel I now live in . Poor Taylor can't find a job either . Lamarr has a trick or two up her sleeve , so to speak . She was formerly a "" friend "" of Joseph Schildkraut - - the sinister , and most improbably Vietnamese villain your worst nightmare might incarnate . When Taylor gets drunk and passes out , Lamarr "" visits "" Schildkraut again . He takes her to the opera , Manon Lescaut , this being one of those movies in which the heavy has class . Schildkraut juggles circumstances and the unsuspecting Taylor finds himself offered a job at last . But things darken . Evidence emerges suggesting that Lamarr did a "" favor "" for Schildkraut , perhaps more generous than simply accompanying him to the opera , and that's how this job offer surfaced . A simple , naive , red-blooded , God-fearing American , true to his principles , Taylor flings Lamarr aside and announces that he's leaving on a ship for America without her . Distraught , Lamarr visits Schildkraut for the last time and shoots him dead . ( I can't help imagine the two of them - - Schildkraut and Kiesler - - making jokes in German about their ludicrous Oriental makeup . ) Lamarr returns to her squalid hotel and shoots herself somewhere in the body , probably a place that doesn't disfigure her too much . She dies slowly enough for Taylor to return and announce that his earlier renunciation of her was so much rodomontade , that he loves her deeply , and that the two of them are leaving on that ship together . It's only after he tells her this , that he realizes she is dying . "" I'll get a doctor ! "" "" No , no . Don't leave me . "" For the next several minutes , the question hangs in the air : Who will be the first to expire , Lamarr or the viewer ? ( And this script comes from BEN HECHT , the fedora-wearing , go-to-hell newspaper reporter from Chicago ! ) I could never get with Robert Taylor ( b . Spangler Arlington Borough ) either as a man or an actor . He was certainly handsome enough in these early movies , enough so that questions were raised at the time about his having hair on his chest . ( His agent produced a photo of a shirtless Taylor to show that he did . ) But his features coarsened with age and MGM kept him soldiering on in lower budget pictures for more than a decade . Hedy Lamarr was a stunning beauty , once glamorized by Hollywood's star-making machine . In her first , notorious film , "" Ekstase "" , the teen-aged Hedi Kiesler seemed a little zoftig in her nude scenes , but enormously appealing , even if not yet etherealized . The set dressing is fine though , jaded as we now are with real location shooting , we can never believe that we are actually in French Indo-China . The photography is professional too .

Text2: An above average , if inexpensive , Warner Brothers war-time movie about the Free French in England . Five French convicts manage to escape from Devil's Island with the help of Grandpere , a patriotic ex-convict who has managed to save enough money to buy the escapees a canoe . He makes them promise that when they escape they will fight the Germans who have occupied France . All but Bogart take the oath . What a bunch of Frenchmen they are too . Grandpere is a Russian . The rest of the group include a New York Episcopalian , one Slovakian Jew , one Jew from New York , a Dutchman , and an Austrian anti-Nazi . That's Warners for you . As long as they had an accent they could be anything . George Tobias does decently by his French accent . Bogart isn't required to try . It's a decent movie - - full of propaganda of course , but well acted and thoroughly dramatic , written by Nordoff and Hall ( "" Mutiny on the Bounty "" ) and directed by craftsman Michael Curtiz . The picture is deadly serious . When a German aircraft attacks the freighter the convicts are on , Bogart not only helps shoot it down but then machine guns the helpless German crew as they climb onto the wings of the wrecked plane . It's a brutal scene today , and probably was at the time . The structure is a little complicated . There is a flashback within a flashback , for instance . ( I think one of the narrators is named Marlow . Is this an echo of Conrad ? ) But we never get lost . There is an action scene near the beginning , in which Free French flying fortresses bomb occupied France and fight off German planes , but most of the film is taken up with the journey made by the convicts from Cayenne to the French airfield in the English countryside .

923,"Text1: The flashdancers of a prestigious dance school are winding up dead thanks to a killer in a leather coat and gloves who uses a lion-headed hat pin and chloroform as his / her weapon . The hard-nosed , tough Candice Norman ( Olga Karlatos ) , embittered by being robbed of her own opportunity of achieving a dance career thanks to a motorcyclist running her over , pushes her students to the very brink . Three dancers have a chance to move on to even greater heights , and this might provide extra motivation towards murder . Candace sees a vision of a model / actor named George Webb ( Ray Lovelock ) coming at her with the murderous hat pin closed in hand ready to stab her . Candace is driven by the dream to pursue George once she spots a billboard add with his face modeling a product . What she doesn't count on is falling for him . The film shows the setting up of certain girls being murdered ( such as two who are attempting to take a shower after practice in the dance school ) and Candace's pursuit of the truth . As she digs deeper , George might be the major suspect in the murders . Set amongst the backdrop of New York City flash-dance music scene at the time , the soundtrack and look of the film shows this time of life in the early 80's as women connived and killed themselves in order to make it to the top of the dance scene by any means necessary . I'm sure in Fulci's macabre mind , he saw an opportunity to question . . Just how far is one willing to go towards achieving that dream ? But , when the killer is indeed exposed even deeper truths come out such as losing that dream before having a true opportunity of achieving it thanks to circumstances out of left field . George is presented as a male model struggling to make it in the treacherous business of modeling and acting . He has ambitions and dreams like the flashdancers , but is hitting the brick wall that often comes when wishing to achieve stardom . Certainly gialli fans ( . . and , most especially those of Fulci fandom ) will probably find this slow and talky . It's also anemic , barely showing any real violence at all due to what the killer uses as his / her weapon . The dialogue and dubbing are nothing to write home about , either . But , technically , Fulci's film is polished . I loved the DVD transfer and felt the cinematography ( . . and how Fulci uses light such as the bathroom / locker rooms in the dance hall at night as the lights blink on and off in increments stating that the electronic doors will be bolted in a specific time frame telling anyone still in the building they need to get out ) and lighting were top-notch . Fulci is quite restrained not filling the screen with bloodshed and gore as he does in his zombie flicks . And , yes , the flash-dance music scene backdrop is indeed cheesy but merely a product of what was happening at the time .

Text2: Michael Ironside ( well cast ; intense , cold and calculating , scary ) wishes to silence talk show host Lee Grant , whose voice inspires women and others because she stands for non-violence ( this has a hint of irony when the ending comes ) among other politically charged subjects . He slices her repeatedly with a knife he carries around , but isn't able to kill her . As she stays in County General Hospital to recover , Ironside will try to get to her by any means possible . This film just doesn't follow Grant's recuperation and the inner ( and outward ) fear her traumatizing occurrence has caused , but also Ironside as we see what has led him down his violent path and how he goes about in planning to get his target . William Shatner portrays Grant's lover and producer / boss and Linda Purl is a divorcée nurse who is a fan of Grant's and future target of Ironside as well . We see the dogged pursuit of Ironside in the film , how he tends to his facially scarred father during visits to a ward where he stays , his collection of photographed pictures of those he murders , and those he victimizes along the way who might offer conflict in his goal of killing Grant . He is mentally traumatized by a childhood where his father abused his mother and may've sexually molested him . He ultimately wants Grant to hear his opinions ( we see letters he writes to all kinds of organizations expressing his hate towards everyone ) because she doesn't answer the hate mail she receives . The film isn't perfect , but there are enough intense moments to keep slasher fans satisfied . Ironside is good and creepy as the killer which is what a slasher film really needs to work , but Grant does seem to stretch the hysteria bit too much at times . Purl is quite good in what seems to be just as much a vital role as the one Grant has .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
924,"Text1: I viewed UCLA's restored print of this musical , an early example of two-strip Technicolor . Much of the action takes place on golf links and fairways , so I expected to see vibrant greens . . . and I DID see some bright hues of green in the actress's costumes . But the foliage and fairways were strangely subdued . All of the flesh tones are very pink , and the women appear to be wearing too much rouge . All the man-made objects have got nice vibrant Easter Egg colours , though . This is one of those candyfloss 1920s musicals where strangers instantly fall in love as soon as they clap eyes on each other . All the gals are man-hungry and randy with it , and the comedy lead ( Jack Haley ) is frightened of women . Haley's character has ' trick eyebrows ' which force him to pull a face whenever he thinks about sex . There's plenty of innuendo here . . . and lots and lots and lots of expository dialogue . I kept expecting someone to enter with a racquet while saying ' Tennis , anyone ? ' . . . except that the action takes place at a golf course . SPOILING ONE PUNCH LINE . For the comedy set piece , Haley and Eugene Palllette must infiltrate the women's changing room to retrieve a McGuffin . I expected them to go in disguised as women , but this movie fooled me : they go in disguised as plumbers , and then they get OUT disguised as women . The male lead in this movie is former silent-film star Buddy Rogers , who once took the trouble to answer my questions when I briefly met him . It pains me to report that his singing voice is just tolerable , and he shows no skill with dialogue . Surprisingly , this crude musical spawned one hit song : ' Button Up Your Overcoat ' , performed enthusiastically by Haley and Zelma O'Neal . A couple of the other songs have dull melodies enlivened by lyrics that just occasionally turn risqué . The choreography is wittier than I'd hoped , and one chorus number features a brief overhead shot . . . several years before Busby Berkeley made this device his personal trademark . Thelma Todd is quite good as the villain , in a role outside her usual range . The very English character actor Claude King is cast here as a stage Scotsman , lumbered with Harry Lauder's ' hoot mon ' accent . Nancy Carroll is quite fetching in a mini-kilt . I must disagree with IMDb reviewer Arne Andersen , who says that the character dubbed Dinty Moore in this movie is named for a famous restaurateur . That name originated with a fictional character in George McManus's comic strip ' Bringing Up Father ' . Eventually , a restaurant was named after the comic-strip character . . . but there never was a real person named Dinty Moore , just as there isn't a real person named Beefsteak Charlie . ' Follow Thru ' is really more interesting as an historical artefact than as a musical , but I enjoyed it . I'll rate this early musical .

Text2: Isn't it strange how crap-movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like : "" boy , this is going to suck harder than few things have ever sucked before "" ? It's pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high ? or even remotely positive - expectations , as "" House of the Dead 2 "" is a sequel to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released . The abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director Michael Hurst , as it was really easy to surpass the quality level of its predecessor . And exactly how embarrassing must this be for Uwe Boll , huh ? Having to acknowledge that a straight-to-video sequel without star power or promotional campaigns is MUCH better than his own pretentious video game interpretation ? In case anyone still doubts : NO , "" House of the Dead 2 : Dead Aim "" isn't a good horror movie at all but , YES : it's definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case you're looking for an undemanding splatter film with loads of gory butchering , sleaze and stupid humor . There's no real connection with the events in the first film ( another advantage ) and this part two opens like a typically rancid sex comedy set in a college campus . The male fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house , inhabited exclusively by blond coeds with enormous breasts , but the party gets interrupted when an insane professor ( Sid Haig ! ) who runs his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie . This is the beginning of a quickly spreading and deadly epidemic but , no worries , as the government is prepared and sends their best scientists & soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and to bring back blood samples for an antidote . Hunting down zombies seems like the most common thing in the world for this squadron , they even named them Hyper Sapiens , but their constantly increasing amount eventually endangers the lives of the most hardened soldiers . Director Hurst thankfully found his inspiration in the more eminent classics of the genre , like James Cameron's "" Aliens "" and ? of course - George A . Romero's dead-trilogy , particularly "" Day of the Dead "" . He luckily also didn't made the same mistakes as Uwe Boll , who inserted footage of the actual video game in his movie ( why ? ! ? ) and slightly exaggerated with the use of CGI-techniques . HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence , like chopped up female corpses and detailed amputations , but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking . Naturally , there's isn't the slightest bit of suspense to enjoy and every dreadful horror cliché features here as well . The film is very enjoyable as long as story writer Mark Altman doesn't try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemics . They're walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls , so we really don't need to know what caused their deaths . Especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sorority slut who clearly hasn't got a clue what all the medical terms mean .

Granted , it isn't always completely credible , however , it tends to be . It is a tad predictable in one or two places . The production value is quite admirable . The cinematography is nice , save for the occasional odd angle ( including the dreaded shin-shot ) . The cutting has moments that stick out like sore thumbs ( somebody , take the hammers away from the people in the editing room ) , beyond that , it's at least adequate . The pacing is fitting , this never lost me . The acting varies , but almost all of it is great , the names and unknowns alike . Plummer , as my fiancée points out , got better as it went along at hiding his accent . The character development is relatively strong , though not all the progression is believable . The political opinion behind this is obvious . The reasoning is a bit simplified , which hurts their case . The language is mild in amount , and moderate in tone , with a couple of harsher words .

Text2: It's rare to find made-for-TV films that are good , or even watchable . This is one of the better , though still not a particularly good film overall . The plot is surprisingly interesting , and it mostly moves at a good pace . It takes us through Dorothy's entire life ( well , mostly her adult life ) and her relationships with male acquaintances , many of which turned out less than fortunate . She has a hard life , and must deal with racism throughout her entire career . The acting is above the typical level of TV-movies , but still not exactly good . It is however mostly - at the very least - acceptable . Berry gives a credible performance . Brent Spiner is surprisingly good . His character is one of the most entertaining to watch throughout the film . Many of the characters are somewhat stereotypical . The writing is at times a bit too predictable and dull , but it's mostly good enough to keep your interest , keep you watching . The film's emphasis on racism and intolerance seems underdone ; we never truly see her being singled out , never experience the ignorant hatred towards her . There are just a few scenes and some vague mentions of it ; and with how much her life was affected by it , I had expected the film to be all about it . The thing is , apart from these few , barely noticeable ( in the film as a whole ) mentions of racism , the film doesn't seem to be about it at all . It focuses more on her unsuccessful relationships with men and her attitude towards being a movie star . I'm guessing either the director didn't know what to do with the film or didn't think the racism was important enough . Either way , it leaves the film seeming more empty and flat . I recommend this to anyone interested in the story and fans of Halle Berry . Just don't expect anything more than a good TV-movie .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Originally titled "" I led 2 Lives "" . The movie starts with Bela Lugosi sitting in a laboratory and telling the theater audience about the mysteries of nature and creation as well as life and death and that nature , as perfect as it is , also makes mistakes . Mixing some chemicals Bela gets what looks like a full head on a mug after you pored a bottle of beer in it and his eyes light up and he says triumphantly "" A life has begun ! "" Then we see a big city and as the camera focuses in on a room where there's the body of a woman who committed suicide we hear Bela , off camera , sadly says "" A life is ended "" .

Since as he wrote in his suicide note "" That he'd rather be dead in womens cloths then have to live without wearing them "" . Police inspector Warren , Lyle Talbot , who handled the case of the transvestite was so shook up over it that a few days later he went to a psychiatrist Dr . Alton , Timothy Farrell , just to settle down his nerves from seeing what he did . Dr . Alton tells Inspector Warren a long story about someone that he treated recently who had the same problem that the unfortunate transvestite had but with a happy ending . Glen , Ed Wood , is a man engaged to Babara , Dolores Fuller , but has a deep secret that he's afraid that if he told her it would destroy their relationship and he would lose her . Glen seems to be more in love with Barbara's angora sweater then he is with her . Dr Alton goes on to explain how Glen is a transvestite and what he does to satisfy his yearnings is to wear womens cloths . Dr . Alton goes on saying that to cure Glen of his obsession was for Barbara to except Glen for what he is after Glen confessed to her . Barbara , after taking a few minutes to absorb all that Glen told her tells Glen "" I don't understand all of this but maybe together we can work it out "" . We see Dr . Alton telling this story to Inspector Warren in a long weird surrealistic like strip show . We see women appearing on screen in all sorts of dress and undress scenes as well as Bela Lugosi popping up every now and then , mostly off camera . Bela Logosi keeps the audience entertained with saying things like "" A story must be told "" and "" Pull the string "" and for some reason that I can't figure out we see a herd of stampeding wild buffalo's in the background . Lugosi starts to get even more ridiculous as the movie rolls on with sayings that make no sense at all in light of the story that were seeing like "" Dragon tell me , do you eat little boys and puppy dogs tails and big fat snails ? "" . So after Dr . Alton's treatment Glen was completely cured of being Glenda by transferring Glenda , Glen's alter-ego , to Barbara but most of all having Barbara except Glen for what he is , a transvestite . With Barbara allowing Glen to wear her cloths both her and Glen can now live happily ever after . As the movie draws to a close Dr . Alton and almost in cadence Bela Lugosi end the it saying sadly that there are other transvestites like Glen who's stories don't have that same happy ending ; and just how many more are there ? just how many more are there ? What can one say after seeing a movie like this ! your left speechless . You have to give Ed Wood credit for not only making "" Glen or Glenda "" as well as staring in it with an added attraction at the conclusion of the film of the then , in 1952-53 , sensational story about the Christine Jorgesen sex-change operation , that was making headline news all over the world . The biggest surprise of all in regard to the movie is how on earth did Wood ever get it passed the ultra-prudish Hayes Commission back in 1953 ? That in itself ranks as one of the great accomplishments in motion picture history .

Text2: SPOILERS After having a spat with his girlfriend Kate , Isabella Hofmann , over a trip that they planned to go on to Antigua computer whiz and software specialist Jack Bauer's , Robert Urich , bad luck continues to follow him when he can't get to his car , because it's locked up in a local garage , and takes the subway home . Watching a woman and her daughter on the train Jack , after they both exit the subway car , spots a poster for a missing four year-old child right in back of him and it's the little girl that he just saw . Like in an Alfred Hitchcock thriller Jack Bauer becomes an innocent bystander who get's caught up with something that he at first doesn't understand and later almost costs him his life . Trying to report the missing girl to the Child Recovery Foundation , that issued the poster , Jack at first finds out that the girl Carla McKillin , Erica Dill , is no longer missing and when he goes to her mom's Laura , Megen Gallagher , apartment to return Cala's doll , that she dropped on the subway , he's attacked by the mother and her neighbors thinking that he kidnapped little Carla and was trying to get a ransom in return for her . Jack at the police station , with Laura , gets in touch with the Child Recovery Foundation and is told that Carla is indeed still missing and that her name was somehow removed from their computer . At first hesitant but then working together with Laura Jack tracks down the woman who he saw with Carla on the subway Amanda Johnson , Christine Danford , at a local bar outside the sixth street station that she got off at with Carla . On dope and terrified of what she knew about not only Carla but scores of other young children , who disappeared over the years , the same way that little Carla did Amanda is later found dead in her hotel room from an overdose that her drug supplier forced on her . As Jack starts to check out , by computer , the movements of Amanda during the time that she had Carla with her he finds out that she was being treated for drug addiction at the local St . James Hosiptal . Amanda scrawled the name St . James on a mirror with lipstick as she was dying . Putting all the evidence together Jack soon realizes that Carla was the victim of a major child and baby selling racket that was using as a front the very agency that was supposed to track down and find missing children ; non other then the Child Recovery Foundation . Though guy Robert Urich really gets a worker-over in "" And Then She Was Gone "" as he gets belted and beaten , what a shiner he got early in the film , at least three different times in three different scenes as he's chased and then chases the kidnapper of Carla through the subway system and the airport on a plane headed for the UK . Tense stand off on the plane as Jack and Laura force themselves on trying to rescue little Carla from her kidnapper before the aircraft goes airborne . A bit overdone ending didn't take away any of the suspense and excitement from the rest of the film and the final scene was truly uplifting with Jack and Kate reunited and back together again after she came back home from her vacation , minus Jack , in Antigua . After all the dangers thrills and excitement that Jack went through in the movie there's nothing on the trip and vacation with Kate that he passed up , and almost destroyed their relationship , that could equal what he went through back at home .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
927,"Text1: This stereotypical , low-grade fantasy lacks both the budget and the directorial imagination to be really exciting . The only epic thing about it is the music score . The film is too cheesy for most adults , but it also has some unpleasant scenes that are unsuitable for kids - making you wonder what audience exactly they had in mind . What kept me watching it is Kay Lenz : she's both endearing and feisty , and she looks particularly sexy when she's angry . Her face has a great "" bone structure "" - she looks a bit like Kim Basinger ( trivia note : they were born the same year , 1953 ) , only more beautiful . And she can even keep a straight face through lines like "" But . . . . he's green ! "" ( when the male lead suggests that they should follow a man ) .

928,"Text1: Ghost In The Machine is one of those movies that comes out with the emergence of some new technology and how it can go wrong . Computers were still in the major developing stages in the early 1990s ( at least compared to today's standards ) , as was the Internet , and Ghost In The Machine seems to be a false start on getting a handle on turning the new technology into a horror movie or suspense thriller . The problem is that the writers of the movie were apparently so anxious to get the film written and filmed and released that they didn't take the time to put any thought into it . The technical production of the film is not entirely a pathetic mess , even though it does assume that electronics come equipped with little windows through which can be seen the shining faces of people at their computers , and that electrical outlets with tape over them will display a blinking red ACCESS DENIED sign if you attempt to get through them , but even the most cartoonish computer animated scenes that took us on a roller coaster ride through our microwave ovens were at least mildly interesting , although not at all convincing . In this case , we are looking more at the technique than the content , the way you watch an abstract relaxation video . The problem here is that the movie tells the story of how a serial killer steals peoples address books and then kills the people listed in them , but a reason for these killings is never even suggested . The closest we come to having a reason for why this guy is so eager to commit all of these brutal killings is during an early scene when he is driving home from his job at the computer shop , and in recklessly trying to pass a slow moving truck he swerves into oncoming traffic only to jerk the wheel to the left and go skidding down a steep hill upside down in his car , laughing all the way , HA HA HA ! So the guy is completely insane . That's a reason , I guess , but probably the most uncreative one imaginable and therefore one of the least interesting ones possible . The whole idea of the killer going into electricity in general is obviously the most unrealistic thing in the entire film , but it is stretched to cover almost the entire movie from beginning to end , which is what shows most clearly the fact that the movie is based on the emergence of the world wide web . It's kind of a what-if thriller about what would happen if a psychotic killer was accidentally released into the electricity based communications system that is the internet and was then able to defy all laws of logic and physics and who knows what else , and if he had somehow developed this overwhelming passion to kill a certain woman and her family and friends for committing the crime of leaving her address book at the computer shop . The movie makes a good solid effort to be a worthwhile thriller , but for the most part it falls completely flat .

Text2: Pixar , especially now that Monsters , Inc . ( preceded by the endlessly amusing For The Birds ) has been released , is quickly becoming more and more famous for the tremendous quality of the short short animated films that precede their feature films . Geri's Game , which can be seen before A Bug's Life , is one of my favorite of all of Pizar's short animated films . It's a testament to the quality of the film that the punchline ( that Geri is playing chess against himself ) is not only revealed in the film's tagline , but is also clearly revealed right at the beginning of the film , and yet it still retains the surprising and amusing affect . The editing in this film is so well-done that , as the chess game switches back and forth between Geri and his alter ego , you almost forget that you already saw that he is alone in the park and is therefore playing against himself in this heated game . I just learned from one of the other IMDb reviewers that Pixar dedicated enormous resources just for such a minor detail as to get Geri's coat to crease just right , and that is exactly the kind of thing that makes a good film , especially a short one . That is a tiny detail , but Pixar is so determined for their films to look just right that it is no surprise that they are now winning Oscars left and right for those films . Pixar spends all of the money that they put into their films in just the right places , and this can clearly be seen in the final product . The purpose of these short film is clearly just to add to the huge amount of entertainment that is almost invariably involved in watching a Pixar film , because they can obviously not serve any other purpose , being so short . It's obvious that they are not put in to increase the viewing time of the sometimes rather short films that Pixar puts out , but rather just to increase the enjoyment derived from their films . When you go to see a Pixar film , you get more than your money's worth , and not because the films take up more of your time , but because the quality is so high . If anything , people should be grateful that the people at Pixar are able to create such huge amounts of entertainment in relatively short periods of time , unless you have nothing better to do than spend your days in a movie theater . While that is definitely how I would personally LIKE to spend my days , I just don't have the time , and I am grateful that Pixar is so good at what they do that they are able to provide entertainment of such high quality and not take up two and a half hours of my time .

While waiting for the subway one night , a bum bothers him for money . Upset over his job he accidentally pushes the guy onto the tracks in front of an oncoming train killing him completely . Nobody sees him do it and he feels a great sense of power and freedom over getting away with it . Now he decides to go after everybody else who wronged him . . . This little gem came out in 1990 . I remember it got great reviews and I saw it with a sold-out audience that applauded at the end . Since then it's just disappeared . Why ? Probably because it's an intelligent , scary , very black and very funny movie . My guess is that this movie was too dark for most viewers to handle . That's a shame - - it's a real good movie . The direction is great - - crooked camera angles are used to convey Caine's state of mind and a great sequence that cross-cuts between a double murder and him with Elizabeth McGovern ( an office worker he supposedly falls in love with ) . The movie is short ( about 90 minutes ) . . . just as long as it should be . Caine is superb in his role . You see him slowly turn from a quiet , unassuming man into a ruthless , cunning killer - - a really great acting job . McGovern has the unenviable role of "" the girl "" but pulls it off and her makes her character sympathetic and believable . All the roles are well done by a cast of top character actors .

James Caan in one of his most memorable roles as Axel Freed a collage English professor , at the prestigious Fordham University in New York City , who's gambling his life away in his almost suicidal attempt to make the big score . Axel is not a total loser in the movie , he does have his share of big hits in the film , but like almost all gamblers he plays to lose more then to win by going against his better judgment , it makes things more challenging and exciting that way for him . It's when he bets and ends up broke that Alex has to go to local mob Shylock's to get cash , to continue his insane betting , that has him at the brink of having his arms legs and head disjointed and broken or busted . Because of the subject matter as well as the fine acting from Mr . Caan and the rest of the cast the movie really grabs you and leaves you feeling almost as depressed and despondent as Axel is in it . You really feel for the man since he has an almost incurable disease , compulsive gambling , thats slowly turning this very likable and friendly person into an uncontrollable monster . Axel is not only destroying himself but his widowed mom Naomie Freed , Jacqueline Brooks . Naomie cashes out her life savings of almost $50 , 000 . 00 to pay off her sons debts to the mob . As soon as Axel gets the money his mother gave him to practically save his life and limbs he immediately gambles it away on a number of basketball games !

932,"Text1: The film that launched Alan Ladd's career , This Gun For Hire is a very short film like the earlier Public Enemy which gave James Cagney his stardom . This would be the normal length of a B film , but it definitely gets all it wants to say in its brief running time . Essentially we have three stories where all the principal players get brought together in the end . The first involves Robert Preston investigating a reported payroll robbery of the firm that Tully Marshall is the president of . Note that I said ' reported robbery . ' The second involves his girl friend , entertainer Veronica Lake being recruited by no one less than a United States Senator to get the goods on one of Marshall's top aides , Laird Cregar who they think is doing some fifth column work at the behest of Marshall . Finally we have contract killer Alan Ladd who's hired by Cregar to bump off Frank Ferguson who is blackmailing Marshall as to his treasonous activities . Preston , Ladd , and Lake don't know they are all on the same case , but by the end of the film they do . Alan Ladd became Paramount's answer to Humphrey Bogart as a star of action / adventure films and noir films . This Gun for Hire launched his career . He was enormously popular through the Forties , Paramount's biggest star after Crosby and Hope . He played cynical tough guys in modern films , but then branched into westerns where for the most part he was the gallant hero . In fact the ultimate gallant white knight hero in Shane . His part as Raven is a difficult one , yet he pulls it off . He's a cold blooded contract killer , one of the earliest ever portrayed as a film protagonist . Yet he's human and you see flashes of it , his concern for cats . As a cat lover , I can sure identify with that . Raven is also one of the earliest characters in cinema who talks about child abuse making him what he is . Groundbreaking when you think about it . Next to Ladd , the biggest kudos have to go to Laird Cregar , borrowed from 20th Century Fox to play Willard Gates . Gates is a top company executive with Marshall's firm which is a defense contractor which is why the Senate is interested in him . He's basically a jerk who thinks he's so clever . Veronica Lake gets to him real easy because of his weakness for the nightclub scene . And he really doesn't take the full measure of Raven , even though the audience is very aware of how deadly he is . When you think about it what Cregar and Marshall do is unbelievably stupid . They hire Ladd to kill Ferguson and then pay him with hot money , from the alleged robbery . Why would you do that ? Chances are in the rackets they're involved in , they might have need of his services in the future . Not a guy to get mad at you . In fact their double cross is what sets the whole film plot in motion . Moral is never double cross a guy who says and means that "" I'm my own police . "" This Gun for Hire was Director Frank Tuttle's finest film . He was a contract director for Paramount who did a whole bunch of films with their various stars in the Thirties and Forties . When he hadn't worked in a while , Alan Ladd got him a job directing him in Hell On Frisco Bay while he was at Warner Brothers and Tuttle also directed A Cry In the Night which Ladd produced . Ladd remembered and was grateful to Tuttle for helping break through into top star ranks . Ladd was like John Wayne that way , ever ready to help a colleague down on his luck . Veronica Lake is recruited by a U . S . Senator with a fictitious name , but in fact there was a committee looking into all kinds of things like this in the Senate in regard to the conduct of the war . It was headed by a Senator from Missouri named Harry Truman who went on to higher office . I wonder if Truman liked This Gun for Hire ? Veronica Lake got a big boost in her career . She and Ladd became a classic screen team as a result of this film . This film is one great cinematic classic , so important to so many careers and still keeps you on the edge of your seat today .

933,"Text1: I base this on the GOTY ( Game of the Year . . . it was awarded that title in ' 98 , and one can still figure out why ) version , and on the PC release . For years after FPS's started being made , after Wolfenstein 3D , the growth was slow , and fairly obvious . Then this came . Marking itself as a big step away from the arcade feel of the predecessors , this was made highly realistic . The way it starts , how it is throughout , at next to no point in all of this is the following not true : It comes off as less of a VG , and more like , well , real life . Heck , this begins with you coming in to work . Of course , you have a really interesting job , and something happens that shapes the rest of this . This doesn't have shiny pick-ups , and all that there are , appear in places you'd expect to find them , ammo not just lying about , but in boxes and on shelves , near dead bodies . There is not technically a single cut-scene in this . . . rather , what will happen is that events occur , and you can overhear conversations ( and a lot of them , you will be directly talked to ) , yet without the angle ever changing ( in all of this ) , and you can still move around , often with whomever is addressing you continually looking towards you . You get to decide from where you want to look at it , and you catching them all depends on you being aware of your surroundings , making for fantastic immersion . Story-telling is well-done , with some being directly explained to you by NPC's , and the rest being discovered , all with the 360 degrees of viewing freedom . They even explain the HUD , as well as the reason you can keep going after being attacked and otherwise taking damage . This has an actual , genuine plot , and it's smart and develops well , to boot . The level design is impeccable , and the fact that this is almost completely linear is hidden nicely . The length is appropriate , and it doesn't overstay its welcome . This manages to combine intense action , a mesmerizing other world ( alongside ours ) , disturbing and creatively done creatures , atmosphere , horror and more incredibly well . The audio is well-done , with well-composed , fitting score , voice acting that is above average and sounds that are all well-chosen and well-done . Puzzle solving , with logical and well-thought out tasks , is part of this . This never gets stale . It helps that there are so many and such different enemies . This was one of the first times AI in something like this was really more than scripted movements and such . There are foes in this that will follow you , work together in teams to try to take you down , using grenades , taking cover , and in general using bona-fide tactics against you . They'll adapt and provide challenge . The arms also demand mention . . . there is not a single weapon in this that is not useful , and almost all of them have secondary fire . Short or long range , fast or accurate , powerful or not as much , there are so many variations , and with a dozen or so specific means of eliminating what you're up against , including , but not limited to , an assault rifle with grenade launcher , a revolver , tripwire mines , explosives you can detonate at will , a shotgun , as well as a couple of exotic entries , not to mention some that allow , to an extent , shooting around corners , you can pretty much pick how you want to dispose of the next group you fight . The graphics are maybe a little dated today , but they are well-done . Purchasing Blue Shift , which holds a High Definition pack ( and that's about all the reason there is to get that particular product ) that applies to this and Opposing Force , as well , helps . The effects are mixed , though with muzzle flashes and , sometimes , fire , being well-done . The entire engine is great , as evidenced also by the massive amount of user-made modifications , mods , that have come out since this did . This was also one of the first to make using them easy . . . it has a menu for them . The multi-player is also well-done , allowing for Free-For-All and Team Deathmatch in plenty of arenas . This has a training portion , the Hazard Course , that teaches you nearly everything you need to know and be able to in order to complete this , even going over movement and such , so if this is the first you play , that can prepare you . You can return to that anytime , and practice or remind yourself how to do something . The re-playability is almost entirely in the three difficulty settings . If you are unsure if this is for you , I would advise trying the "" Uplink "" ( the demo ) , free of charge . It gives you a sense of what the full thing is like , without it just being a part of it , but instead unique . This has humor , and it doesn't go overboard . There is a well-done loading feature , allowing for large , fairly extensive areas with no problems . It makes use of this , with taking you through a number of grand and well-done locations . Saving can be done anywhere and anytime you want in this . The boss battles are well-done and satisfying , without being overly frustrating . You can , in this , ask those on your side to follow you or stay put , and this is easily accessible , and used well in this , as some of them help you by opening doors ( so keep them alive ! ) , and those that have guns , use them to help you out , and / or defend themselves . That feature is used well . There are , unfortunately , numerous bugs and glitches in this , the least of them being clipping . They can be troublesome , and at times the stability even suffers . There is a little language in this , of moderate strength . There is relative violence and gore , and it is definitely not for children . I recommend this to any fan of First Person Shooters , especially those who want it to be a step up from Doom ( it is fun , yes , don't get me wrong , it's just simple ) and / or science fiction .

Text2: I mainly watched this to see Natalie Portman , as I've been a fan of hers for some time , and have been very impressed with most of her performances , but I have to admit , as I started watching it , I really liked it . It grabbed my attention immediately and never lost it . The plot is interesting and captivating ; it revolves around Timothy Hutton , who plays Willie , a late-20's piano player who returns to his home town after ten years , to meet his old friends and celebrate the 10-years high-school reunion with them . When he arrives , he quickly finds out that nothing really has changed in the last decade , at least not for his friends and the town in general . His friends are all still struggling with their love lives , their family and their lives in general . Among those friends are Tommy ( Matt Dillon ) , who has a girlfriend , and an affair with a married woman with a child ; Michael ( Noah Emmerich ) , who has settled down and gotten a family , and seems to be content and Paul ( Michael Rapaport ) , who's girlfriend has just broken up with him , because he couldn't commit after a long relationship , and who almost worships models , because he is very hung up on beauty . Willie quickly meets the new neighbor , or , rather , the new neighbors teen girl , Marty ( Natalie Portman ) , who almost immediately casts her love on him , despite their obvious age difference . The entire cast does a great job ; Timothy Hutton plays a great somewhat happy guy , who realizes that no one in his home town , where he grew up , have moved on , done something with their life , like he has . Matt Dillon gives a great performance as the former high school stud , who can't give up on either of the girls in love with him . Noah Emmerich plays a believable dependent father , who can't seem to raise his kids without his wife's help . Michael Rapaport portrays the hopeless dreamer who couldn't settle down with his girlfriend , and can't get over his ex . Natalie Portman gives a great performance as the Lolita-like Marty , who falls in love with someone she knows , deep down , that she can't be with . The characters are all well-written and interesting , and , despite the fact that there are so many , they all get the screen-time they deserve and require . I also enjoyed and somewhat liked every single character ; even the one played by Rosie O'Donnell , who I normally loathe , was entertaining and interesting . The humor in the film is great , it doesn't seem forced and it just blends in . The film doesn't have any of the cliches often associated with dramas that have a high school reunion in them . The actors all have great chemistry , and really make you believe that they are that character , not just an actor playing a part . I liked the "" Wizard of Oz "" theme and references , though I'm not entirely sure what to make of them . Either the city was "" Kansas "" , or it was "" Oz "" . Anyway , all in all , a great drama , with great humor and great acting . I recommend it to fans of any of the actors , fans of dramas and generally people looking for a good little film with an all-round great cast and believable characters .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
934,"Text1: Ah , Stephen King , he made the right choice in not directing again . Perhaps it was just a fluke or a lark or one of those dares he took to see if he could make a movie as good ( or perhaps as crappy ) as some of the other mid-80s ilk that came out , some actually not bad like the Dead Zone and Pet Sematary , while some like Children of the Corn not quite so good really . So , he took one of his short stories and expanded it , unwisely , to a 98 minute length feature script and filmed it , in all its unwieldy glory . . . glory , I say , with that dose of sarcasm needed . Maximum Overdrive is total trash that's a blast to watch , and I almost would be more forgiving of it if it just wasn't so completely dumb-headed the whole way . The problem is not actually in the direction , oddly enough , but in the script itself , which is troubling for something that should be potentially intentionally awesome from King . It's like he cobbled together ideas from the likes of Chrstine and the Stand and the Mist and other works that we all know are just like this and added in trucks and rednecks to give it some "" flavor "" ( perhaps it not set in Maine is is a saving grace I didn't really notice ) . He also peoples it with Emilio Estevez , Pat Hingle , Yeardley Smith , and a bunch of other actors you probably will NOT remember , or even care to , gives them some laughable ( "" We MADE You ! "" ) and dead-pan-serious dialog that is not entirely laughable ( really , did anyone laugh when Estevez made that "" Eat my shorts ! "" line which was already dated when Bart Simpson said it ? ) And , finally , the trucks themselves , them like other random electrical devices directed by the rays of a wayward comet that will only be in the orbit , as we learn from the opening title card , for about 8 days , which have a logic that makes as much sense as a turtle solving a Rubik cube in two minutes . I wanted to get with what the trucks were all about in attacking as this random , evil force that comes only in King stories ( well , not only , but most prominently in the last thirty years ) , but too long the trucks spend just circling around the diner at the gas station , like cowboys in a perpetual loop circling around a group of Indians , and by the time they crash through the diners me and my friends shouted in unison : FINALLY ! It goes without saying some of the stuff with said trucks , like the one with the Green Goblin on the front , was cool . But as with so much stuff in the picture , you only go with it for so long until you pretty much say "" alright , that's it , I give up . "" If it had been shorter , and this isn't just some ' it would work better as a 25 minute Twilight Zone episode ' thing but it's close enough , like a Creepshow segment , it could be potentially amazing . But it takes too long to get where it's going , it retreads familiar ground , and only one or two moments actually POP with the kind of scariness that King himself promised in a direct-address to the audience where he proclaimed : "" I'll scare the HELL out of you ! "" Sad to say , he didn't . At the least though it wasn't boring and had a few good laughs .

Text2: Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore at times might not look it to those who don't check ( or care to check ) the director credit , but Martin Scorsese - in the interim between Mean Streets and Taxi Driver - took on a film where he could prove to his detractors wrong . Indeed , Scorsese can direct anyone well , man , woman , child ( just look at Kundun if you don't believe his knack for directing non-professional along with pros , besides the point ) . In this story , Ellen Burstyn plays the title character , left abandoned with her son after her husband dies . She has to make ends meet as a waitress in Phoenix in order to make her dream for her and her son come true - getting to Monterey . Enter in that cool presence that is Kris Kristofferson , and the film goes into not-so-conventional territory ( some would argue up till the end ) . For acting students , this is one of those kinds of films one has to check out - Burstyn , in her Oscar winning role , plays between kind , angry , frightened , scared , and strong in her role , trying to break past other female types that had been around in films at the time . There is also ample room for a small role for Harvey Keitel , as a smooth talker with a bad temper . Scenes between the two of them are like method acting staples of 70's movie-making ( not to downplay Kristofferson or Diane Ladd's performances either ) . And then there's Scorsese , injecting his style sometimes without much of a trace , and sometimes so forcefully that one who knows his work well can sit up and take notice . The improvisation he lets the actors have in scenes is so delicate and precise that it adds to the reality - or the illusions - of most scenes . There is also a very funny ( in a weird way ) beginning to the film as a parody of farm-girl good times goes on . A recommended treat - those who are die-hards for the Scorsese crime films may be perplexed , but for the Lifetime TV crowd who usually wouldn't go near a Scorsese film at the video store will likely be more pleased than I was ( or maybe not - this film has as much detractors as defenders for its feminist themes ) .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

In America , they find wealth along the way with all its glamor . Nevertheless , she makes enemies with a number of people who swear vengeance against her . Leading the pact is Steven Berkoff in another absolutely brilliant performance as her Nazi tormentor , who killed her mother and is sentenced to life in prison . Due to his connections , he is released from prison only to pursue Collins and Dalton , planning financial ruin for them both . His only opposition is when 2 of the conspirators want her death instead . For the ladies , there are plenty of gorgeous fashions as Collins and Dalton lead a fashion magazine . There is plenty of action along the way . Neil Dickson is highly effective as Hubert , who loved Collins after the war only to be usurped by his father , a rather engaging but vicious Jean Pierre Aumont .

Because of the wars waged by the United States , the whole world exploded into war , the US got reduced to a third world country , and the fascistic Adam Sutler ( John Hurt ) seized power in England . Imposing devout Christianity on everyone , he rules with the slogan "" England prevails ! "" . However , Sutler's days just might be numbered . A masked man known only as V ( Hugo Weaving ) seeks to overthrow this dictator on November 5 , to commemorate Guy Fawkes trying to blow up parliament .

Text2: A . L . Kroeber was a fascinating and brilliant man , completely devoted to his field . During the earthquake of April , 1906 , he pulled himself out of the rubble in his downtown home , shook off the dust , and walked many miles up hill to check on his Museum , which was located where the U . C . Medical Center now stands , at the top of Parnassus . He was into everything . He was the first person to bring anthropology to the West Coast and almost everyone who met him considered themselves friends of his . He also wrote what was probably the most lucid and all-encompassing general text of anthropology , a huge 1948 tome , which is now considered out of date because of its content ( we now know a lot more ) and its approach ( culture as determined by history and styles rather than materialism ) . The progressives dislike him for this and for the fact that his benefactress was Phoebe Hearst . And yet , he was devilishly smart , able to outline some social problems that we are only now trying to cope with , like globalization , which he called "" the universal pattern . "" What happens when the whole world depends on an oil-based industry - - and then we run out of oil ? I won't go on about him except to say that he loved his first wife - - Ann Archer in this movie - - that his second wife , Theodora , wrote a graceful biography of Kroeber , subtitled , I think , "" A Personal Configuration . "" Also , the "" K . "" in Ursula K . LeGuinn stands for "" Kroeber , "" since she was his daughter . The movie itself sometimes lapses into clichés but there are blessedly few of them . It's been years since I read "" Ishi : The Last Yahi , "" but as I remember it he was consistently polite and cooperative . The movie yields to the temptation to make him a bit of a mystic , listening to the song of the earth ( which Kroeber is unable to hear ) . But I don't know if such beliefs are so alien to the spirit of the Indians of California . There are other conjectural episodes added to spice up what the writers might otherwise have thought a too-pedestrian story . Ishi gets deflowered . The next morning we see him humming happily to himself , hard at work polishing the glass cases in the museum . The movie also turns Kroeber into a kind of stereotypical scientist . "" You have Ishi here ? "" Ishi asks Kroeber , tapping Kroeber's notebook . "" In the book ? Yes . "" "" But not here , "" says Ishi , tapping Kroeber's chest . But , well , okay , so it's poetic license . ( I think actual documentaries of Ishi's life with the white folks are available . ) The performances are outstanding . If the film creaks at the joints while straining to make the characters look human , the performers take it over the finish line . God , John Voight can be a good actor when he gets his teeth into a role . Here he does a splendid job as a man who puts as much distance as he can between himself and human emotions . Voight expertly conveys the discomfort and helplessness Kroeber feels when faced with unpleasantness . It makes his final breakdown , when he sings abjectly over Ishi's death mask , almost unbearably moving . Without the delicate touches provided by the actors , what we would otherwise have is the story of a man "" getting in touch with his feelings , "" whatever that means . Being an Indian in California wasn't all bad , at least until the white folks came along . ( Stereotypical incidents - - two of them - - of hairy white men shooting down helpless Yahi . Not to say that it didn't happen in early California , because it did . ) The Chumash lived in what is now Santa Barbara , for instance . They left huge piles of garbage behind . If you were to dig in one of OUR old garbage dumps , you'd find that the deeper you dig , the more "" primitive "" the tools become . There may be disposable ballpoint pens at the top , but under that would be a layer of ballpoints made to last , and under that a layer of fountain pens , and under that ink pens with long wooden handles , then quill pens , and so on . But if you dig into a Chumash garbage dump , you can dig down through three thousand years of their history and find virtually no change in their artifacts . Why should they invent new stuff ? They didn't need it . They had it made . Of course , tragically , the Chumash have now gone the way of the Yahi and the various tribes that were incorporated into the 21 California missions , most of whom died of disease . Next time you visit Mission San Juan Bautista , consider the fact that just over the low stone wall there are roughly 3 , 000 unmarked Indian graves . Ishi has a lot of company .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: Despite the difficult subject of death row , Stephen King's Green Mile is a story about death row inmates and the men who guard and will execute them in the end . The cast is excellent with Tom Hanks always turning in an Academy Award winning performance as the head guard . I never imagined the Bosom buddy could be brutal . He is surrounded by very accomplished actors and actresses-Bonnie Hunt plays his wife and Patricia Clarkson plays the ill-stricken wife of James Cromwell's character . I enjoyed watching professional actors like James Cromwell , Harry Dean Stanton and William Morse turn in excellent performances all around . I have to say that I was saddened by Michael Jeter's finest performance in the movie before his own death by AIDS . Of course , the main reason I watched was for Doug Hutchison who now plays Sebastian Hulce on Guiding Light , my favorite soap . As wonderful as he was in The Green Mile , he is better as Sebastian . I found his performance to be a breakthrough performance for somebody . But it is Michael Clarke Duncan who truly earned his Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor that was really inspiring to watch . If you ever had a definite view of the death penalty , this film will change your mind about the barbarism and cruelty not on the death row inmates but on the guards themselves . I probably won't watch this film again . I get too emotionally involved . I am glad that the electric chair is not used like it used to be . It is rarely used nowadays . It is replaced by lethal injection . But now I wonder about the guards who befriend and form relationships with their prisoners whether they liked it or not . Now I wonder what happens to the guards after they become executioners themselves ? You wonder what makes them different from the criminals !","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He is now a well known comedy actors , mostly thanks to his role in the American Pie movies but it's quite amazing that he ever became a big actor once you see the stuff he starred in at the beginning of his career . It's also even more amazing to think that this movie is directed by Ivan Reitman , the man who later brought us the movies "" Stripes "" , "" Ghostbusters "" , "" Dave "" and the more recent comedy "" My Super Ex-Girlfriend "" . Only his trademark comedy style can be seen back in this movie . Furthermore this movie doesn't show much of Reitman's talent , which is also do of course to the movie its really bad script ( also partly written by Ivan Reitman himself ) and its obvious very limited money and resources . The movie lacks some good editing cuts and camera position among many other things . The movie looks like a bad ' 70's porn , without all of the sex ( but with the nudity ) . It's a real amateur like looking movie . Despite having comedy elements in it , this movie above all is a serious horror attempt from Ivan Reitman . Luckily he soon discovered his talent more lays at the comedy genre , or else we wouldn't had ever had the fine and classic comedies he made later in his career . But how can you even really regard this movie as an horror film , when it has so little gore ( well , at least for a cannibal flick ) in it and no scares at all . The movie basically has a non-existent story that is hard to follow because it just doesn't make an awful lot of sense all . You'll have a hard time understanding when the movie is in flashback mode and when it's set in real time and what's real and what's not . It's the sort of script that makes you wonder why they even decided to shoot it in the first place . It's a confusingly bad made movie , that often makes you go ; ' What's going on here ? ! ' . This movie is not at all what you could and should expect from a cannibal flick . It's just not an awfully interesting movie to watch , since too little interesting is ever happening in it . It's not even interesting as a study of an early Ivan Reitman movie . There is really no reason why you should ever watch this bad ' 70's flick .

Text2: All I can say after watching this movie is that I hope that "" The Wolf Man "" - remake by Joe Johnston , starring Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins will be a better werewolf movie than this movie was . It should be , since it has being written by Andrew Kevin Walker . What this movie once more proofs is what an incredible one day-fly writer Andrew Kevin Walker was . After his "" Scream "" script he hasn't delivered a decent story ever since . This movie is also filled with real bad dialog and some real standard formulaic elements but above all also a story in which too little is ever happening . This is a werewolf movie for Pete-sake but the movie actually features very little action or excitement in it . Instead the movie chooses to focus on some way less interesting plot-lines and characters you just don't care about . For too long and too many times throughout the movie , too little interesting is happening . The movie is filled with some stupid false-scare effects . The way of camera-position and editing and build-up already always give away a false-scare is imminent . You don't have to have seen many horror movies to know that . It's done so obvious and incredibly predictable . No , iconic horror director Wes Craven really shows poor form with this movie . A problem of the movie also really lays with its incredible standards camera-position and poor formulaic style of editing . You can hardly call this a very creative or original movie . The actors also really don't seem to know how to handle the movie its poor dialog and just plain bad and silly situations . You also know something is seriously wrong with a movie when it has Mya on its cast list . The special effects are also really below for a big-budget modern 2005 horror movie . The movie features some good looking special makeup effects from artist Rick Baker but it doesn't uses this enough throughout the entire movie , which seemed like a real missed opportunity . I mean when you have Rick Baker working on your movie , USE HIM ! Perhaps the movie would had been a better one if it didn't took itself as serious as it did . If it was done more in the style of "" An American Werewolf in London "" and "" An American Werewolf in Paris "" it would at least had been a more entertaining movie to watch .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Everything about it is epic , including the battle scenes and the scope of the story which uses the Civil War background in an interesting way . Many real-life personalities are woven into the story of love and friendship during the war - - including HAL HOLBROOK , impressive as Abraham Lincoln , and LLOYD BRIDGES as Jefferson Davis . Once again , the fortunes of the Hazzarads and the Mains is told in interesting vignettes that take shape as the story progresses through the start of the war until the end . Along the way , you'll recognize a lot of famous names , including KIRSTIE ALLEY , in one of her unlikeliest dramatic roles , OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND , David CARRADINE , LESLEY-ANNE DOWN , PARKER STEVENSON , PATRICK SWAYZE , LEE HORSLEY , JEAN SIMMONS and JAMES STEWART . Olivia de Havilland has told an amusing anecdote of how she only accepted the role of Mrs . Neal , the head nurse , when told that she tended to the wounded of both North and South - - since the South had already only known her as Melanie , the flower of southern womanhood in GWTW . Photographed in color , it's exceptionally well filmed with sets and costumes that are above reproach . Aside from the romantic angle , it presents an accurate picture of the Civil War era and is a sort of history lesson as well as a compelling drama .

Actually , he was a survivor and wants to collect $120 , 000 in insurance he took out before the flight by pretending to be dead . Of course , his wife has to collect it . The two don't exactly get along , and the only way to be rid of him is for Lisa to collect the money for him . She is falling for a newspaperman ( Young ) , who is suspicious as to what is going on . Her husband promises he will let her go once he has the money . This is a very unsatisfactory film , in part because of the miscasting of Tony Perkins as Loren's husband . Not only that , but the acting just isn't very good even from pros like Loren , Perkins and Young . Litvak only made two more films after this - it appears he lost his touch after making some marvelous films : This Above All , All This and Heaven Too , Tovarich , City for Conquest . Either that or he had to make too many concessions . At any rate , he didn't pay too much attention to what the actors were doing . The story just meanders along . Not very good .

Tracy is an alcoholic who , for the sake of his health and sobriety , becomes a civil attorney , only to be drawn back into criminal work when neighborhood friends need him to defend their son . The son is played by a pre-Gunsmoke , blond James Arness , and it was a pleasure to see him do something besides the one-note Matt Dillon . Diana Lynn does an excellent job as Tracy's protective daughter , and a pathetically young Richard Anderson is her patient fiancé . Tracy's performance drives the film , which is really just an excuse for a character study , and who better to essay it . He beautifully shows the man's torment and loss of abilities . The ending is tense and suspenseful . There is a fine cast , including the above , Pat O'Brien John Hodiak , Eduardo Cianelli , and William Campbell ( who in real life was for a time married to Judith Exner , the woman who went public with her affair with JFK ) .

Text2: Booth Tarkington's memorable novel became a hit film of 1942 . It's the story of the deterioration of an American family set in the mid-west at the turn of the century . Their lives change drastically as the country is industrializing . Orson Welles amassed an impressive cast where Joseph Cotten twice attempted to marry Isabelle Amberson , ( Dolores Costello ) but fate intervened each time . While both marry others , it appears that their offspring George ( Tim Holt ) and Lucy ( Anne Baxter ) will marry each other but the fates are tempting again . Holt , as the wealthy scion , steals many of the scenes in every sense of the word . He is equally matched by Aunt Fanny , a superb Agnes Moorehead . She portrays a spinster aunt , sister-in-law of Isabelle , who has designs of her own regarding Cotten . An interesting note to this film is that Agnes Moorehead won the N . Y . film critics award for best actress in 1942 for this film . When it came Oscar time , she was nominated for best supporting actress for it and promptly lost to Teresa Wright in "" Mrs . Miniver . "" Orson Welles does a great job directing . The close-ups of the town gossips are memorable . The eerie scenery sets the standards of what the film is all about . It is filmed beautifully in black and white . The coldness of winter is evenly set against the strong family relationships that only death can put an end to . Too bad that over a half-hour of this wonderful film was cut .

His business will take him no longer than 24 hours , but the locals still regard him with unbridled suspicion and hostility . Local character Reno Smith ( Robert Ryan ) , with the help of thugs like Hector ( Lee Marvin ) and Coley ( Ernest Borgnine ) , seems to be the one running things , and he's no help , although Doc Velie ( Walter Brennan ) provides at least one reasonable voice to the proceedings . A phenomenal cast delivers the goods in this effective little movie . It's a very well shot ( in CinemaScope by William C . Mellor ) and polished major studio ( in this case MGM ) movie done in an efficient B movie style , with an attention-grabbing title and tight and trim running time . It's not exactly hard to figure out the mystery , but director John Sturges still keeps the level of tension high as MacReedy encounters problems every step of the way . The remote setting works in ensuring MacReedy no place to run or hide . Marvin and Borgnine are excellent as the heavies ; the almost all-male cast are a fine bunch of rugged , virile men unencumbered by any sort of familial responsibilities . The lovely Anne Francis is the sole female presence , and doesn't play a very big part in the plot . Dazzling opening titles , Andre Previns ' music score , and an intelligent script ( Howard Breslins ' story "" Bad Day at Hondo "" was adapted by Don McGuire and written by Millard Kaufman ) are all assets . It deals with the need to overcome apathy and ultimately do the right thing , and is an effective condemnation of the racism of the times as well . This is a marvelous film worth seeking out .

He travels to the South with an old friend who is selling cure-all elixirs from his wagon ; meanwhile , without Duke's behind-the-scenes work , Ethel is a flop in New York . It's all fairly mediocre . Horne would become a much better actress in her later films . Fans of the singer will probably be disappointed anyways , as she is only in the film for about 15 minutes .

Text2: Jeeze , whoever decided , out of the blue , to declare Hou Hsiao-hsien a master filmmaker was really pushing it . Those who chose to believe that opinion are even more guilty . I don't want to declare that he's untalented . I did truly like Dust in the Wind and City of Sadness , no matter how flawed I found them to be . The Puppetmaster is an enormous step in the wrong direction , more like the atrocious A Time to Live , a Time to Die than the two I actually tolerated . Hou's just not especially talented . People praise him to high heaven , claiming that his style is incredibly unique . Let me diagram his directorial technique : 1 . Static long shots with few movements and few close ups . 2 . His shots are often framed by doorways and the like . 3 . Many landscape shots . 4 . Characters in a scene often remain out of sight for a long time at the beginning of a scene , which confounds the audience when a visible character is talking to or interacting with them . 5 . Loose narrative structure . 6 . The subject of his films is most often Taiwanese history , often radiating from the tumultuous period of the WWII era . That's it . There is not one thing on this list that hasn't been done before and much better , whether Asian or Western ( well , maybe the thing about Taiwanese history , but plenty of great filmmakers have illuminated their own country's history ) . The combination of several of these factors ( and no more ) is a recipe for insomnia medication . His cinema is about as limiting as cinema can get , reminscent of pre-Griffith cinema , where filmmakers never thought to move their camera or give a close-up of anything . The effects are all de-dramatizing , which is extraordinarily pointless . As Pauline Kael once said , if films aren't supposed to be entertaining , then what are they supposed to be ? Torture ? I know what Hou's answer would be . Sorry . I went a bit too far with that last paragraph . The Puppetmaster does have its great moments , mostly coming in two forms : theatrical performances ( puppet plays and opera ) and one-on-one interviews with the Puppetmaster himself , Li Tien-lu , where he tells long and rambling stories - long and rambling , but very interesting and entertaining - about his life . The rest of the film is made up of accounts of the events he's talking about acted out on screen . Some are good , some are bad , but none of them are inherently interesting . Since these episodes are only tenuously connected to the past and the future , there is absolutely no weight to these scenes . This is particularly pathetic , because the real Li Tien-lu was the best part of both Dust in the Wind and City of Sadness . I would have been infinitely more contented to just watch the interviews without the sketches , because Li is a beautiful human being ( not to mention a marvelous actor ) whose face , body movements , and tone of voice communicate infinitely more than the motionless actors and actresses who are insultingly acting out his life experiences . And people who would like to deify this director and , consequently , want to crucify me , check out my other tastes : if you want to jump to the conclusion that I'm a brainless American who needs his movies fast , chew on a few of my favorite films that 99 % of the population would find as slow as molasses : 2001 , anything by Andrei Tarkovsky , anything by Antonioni , most things by Bergman , My Dinner with Andre , Dreyer's sound films ( Ordet , Day of Wrath , and Gertrud ) , Rhapsody in August , The Decalogue , and The Dreamlife of Angels , for starters . How about those who would criticize me for not liking loose narratives ? Godard is one of my very favorite filmmakers . And seeing that The Puppetmaster was supposedly improvised , at least in the editing room , I happen to love Pierrot le fou , Godard's film where he , Jean-Paul Belmondo , and Anna Karina grabbed a camera and went out on the road , improvising an entire film ( as rumor has it ) . And if this is all Hou could come up with if he came into this film not having an idea what he was going to make , Fellini did the same thing with 8 , and that is one of the ten best films ever made , in my opinion . Now how come I don't love this master's films ? The answer is simple , methinks : he's no master . I have very stubbornly stuck with a different Hou film every Friday for a month now , and he has revealed little or nothing to me about the human condition or the nature of filmmaking . Seeing that the showings are free , I'm not going to skip them . However , I can breathe a huge sigh of relief that there is a two week break in this particular series . for The Puppetmaster .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

From then on it's like watching a Hopalong Cassidy movie except this one is from Lone Star and is obviously a poverty row project with a few interesting moments for anyone who stays with it for 53 minutes . The tree stump idea puzzled me , as did the wall vault which served as the device behind which The Shadow gave orders - - and the whole plot is so rushed that there's little time to digest any of the backstory that leads up to the main storyline . A pretty girl is the romantic interest for Wayne but has little to do and GEORGE HAYES is beardless for this one before he grew his trademark stubble . Actually , the slender story seems like something borrowed from a Zane Grey western - - the one where the girl is part owner of a ranch , the bad guy is actually someone she knows but never suspects , and a cowboy with strong capabilities comes along and rescues her when she's in danger . The covered wagon going over the cliff into water is a neat sight toward the end and some of the stunt work involving riders and horses is on the mark . YAKIMA CANUTT is fun to watch as Wayne's Indian sidekick , a sort of Tonto to Wayne who rides a white horse . Passes the time quickly , but is clearly John Wayne as an apprentice actor .

Text2: THE HUMAN STAIN is a handsomely produced independent film that strives hard to be a serious study of the effect racial prejudice has on an educated college professor ( ANTHONY HOPKINS ) who takes early retirement when he is accused of using the word "" spooks "" to cover two of his students who have never showed up for class . In the course of the story , we learn that he himself is a black man passing for white and dealing with a secret he's kept in the dark for most of his life . It has an odd way of telling the story with frequent intervening and overlapping flashbacks that are sometimes hard to follow . When he meets NICOLE KIDMAN , we have two lost souls . She's running from her past , blaming herself for the accidental death of two children and running from a crazed ex-husband ( ED HARRIS ) who threatens to break up her improbable relationship with the college professor . Kidman tackles a role beyond her scope as a trailer trash type who makes her living as a custodian cleaning up other people's messes . She is never convincing and makes the unappealing character both annoying and absurd , and has absolutely no chemistry with Hopkins . ED HARRIS and GARY SINISE do well in underdeveloped roles and both have some very valid moments where they seem like real people instead of contrived characters . Production-wise , it's handsomely photographed in rugged winter settings but much of it fails to get the points across without stretching too hard . WENTWORTH MILLER is appealing as the younger Hopkins , but it's hard to accept that the handsome dark-haired youth could turn into a man resembling the older Hopkins . Kidman is forced to recite lines like : "" Action is the enemy of thought , "" which is about as meaningless as the priceless "" love means never having to say you're sorry "" ( from LOVE STORY ) . She's a girl with no possessions who travels light , falls in love easily with an older man and later informs him that she has a crazed ex-husband . Both she and Hopkins have constructed their lives around a lie and it seems they deserve each other . Neither one becomes a sympathetic character . An interesting failure , it tries to say serious things about race but too much of it is unbelievable and handicapped by unpleasant characterizations .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
956,"Text1: VALKYRIE accomplishes the mission it sets out to perform within a two hour running time . Under Bryan Singer's direction , it's a taut thriller bearing the outlines of a true story , handling a complex military plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler that depends on split-second timing to succeed . As we all know , it almost works . It's the "" almost "" factor that gives the film a gripping edge , even though we know the plot fails . The complete story of the events is pared down to make a concise thriller that wastes not a second of screen time . As Colonel Von Stauffenberg , TOM CRUISE gives an effective performance , given that no more of his background is known or explained fully . He delivers a crisp , tight , forceful performance , bolstered by the fact that others around him do equally convincing jobs . BILL NIGHY , TERENCE STAMP , KENNETH BRANAGH , TOM WILKINSON , THOMAS KRETSCHMANN - - these are the most prominent and all of them are splendid in portraying Nazi officers who recognize that Hitler's Germany is not the one they envision for the world , intent on seeing Hitler's Germany crushed and given new leadership . Photographed on many of the actual location sites in Germany , it's a vivid recreation of the period with excellent use of sets , costumes and explosives . All of the shattering wartime explosions are extremely well crafted , as is the bomb that almost destroys Hitler's conference room . The pulsating music score gives the film a solid amount of suspense once the plan is underway . This forces the first half of the film to be largely exposition , but none of the exposition is dull . It sets up the story to follow in an intelligent way . The New York Times movie critic dismissed the film's values and referred to Cruise as "" too much Tom Cruise "" to be believable in the role . Not true . It's much more serious than that , and the film's tone is totally unlike the style of many of the war movies of the ' 40s - - "" Desperate Journey , "" for example , featuring the antics of the Warner contract players in a film starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan about putting one over on the Nazis , which was juvenile nonsense . It's intelligent and engrossing from beginning to end , an efficient WWII yarn based on true incidents that should be seen and appreciated for what it is - - not for bashing Mr . Cruise and whatever tabloid headlines exploit his personal life . It might also inform some of today's teen-agers about an event that actually happened during WWII - - at least those teens who are interested in the subject .

Text2: First of all , in defense of JOAN FONTAINE , it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly miscast as Alyce , the young British lady who has the title role . Fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here , but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned . Fortunately , she went on to better things . But here it's FRED ASTAIRE , GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get the top billing - - and they are excellent . Fans of Burns & Allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into Astaire's dance routines . Especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer Hermes Pans an Oscar . They join Astaire in what has to be the film's most inventive highlight . Unfortunately , not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story - - nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer . It must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment . Only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs . Some pleasant Gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve . The nice supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner , at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant , Constance Collier and Montagu Love ( as Joan's father mistaken as a gardener by Astaire ) . It's a lighthearted romp whenever Burns & Allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days . Both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with Astaire's footwork . Director George Stevens makes sure that Joan Fontaine's hillside dance number with Fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera-work cannot disguise the fact that she is out of her element as Astaire's dance partner , something she seems painfully aware of .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
957,"Text1: I was nine years old and a new comedy show was on the air . The show was named for it's star , but the fact was that the public knew the star from his "" stage "" / "" television "" persona - it really should have been called "" The Jose Jimenez Show "" . Some stereotypes are not meant to be offensive , but eventually are considered that way . Bill Dana created a character named "" Jose Jimenez "" on the old Steve Allen TONIGHT show . The character was part of Steve Allen's regular troop of characters , frequently popping up in his "" Man on the Street "" interviews . There was the nervous Don Knotts , constantly shaking at the interviewer and his cameraman , and saying "" Noop "" instead of "" Nope "" . There was Louis Nye as "" Gordon Hathaway "" , the overly smooth hipster who always addresses his questionnaire as "" Stevarino "" . Tom Poston was a slow witted type , constantly having problems with the questions . The long forgotten ( unjustly I felt ) Dayton Allen would begin his complicated answers with , "" WHY NOT ! ! "" . And there was Dana , using a "" Mexican "" accent as "" Jose Jimenez "" , who in a quiet and gentle manner would try to answer the question in his broken English , frequently making a ridiculous point that most of us never thought of . Dana's opening line "" My nam ' Jose Jimenehs . . . ' became a minor catch phrase of the late 1950s and early 1960s . Unfortunately it would go the way of the "" Frito Bandito "" and other Latino stereotypes after about 1967 or so . As a partial backlash from the more vocal Latino community ( being spurred on by the Civil Rights movement , as were feminists , gay rightists , and other minorities ) , these figures - even if meant as relatively harmless - were seen as bad as "" Amos and Andy "" were . So the characterization was doomed anyway . Therefore , in retrospect , Mr . Dana getting his own television show may be considered his high point . I have to agree it was not a well written show , and it really only gets a "" 6 "" from me because of the performances of it's three main leads : Dana , Gary Crosby , and Jonathan Harris . Occasionally Don Adams added his comic abilities , but he did not appear as frequently . Set in a hotel , Dana / "" Jimenez "" and Crosby were bellboys , and Harris the hotel manager . Although one of the other comments suggested Harris like "" Jimenez "" , in truth he found "" Jimenez "" constantly getting into his hair due to his involvement with Crosby's wild schemes . Crosby would usually have a scheme that would get him a date or some money , and would ask "" Jimenez "" to assist him , and "" Jose "" would reluctantly be drawn into it , but would find his own ass in a sling as a result . But he would drive the pompous Harris ( honing the domineering tones of Dr . Zachary Smith quite well ) up the wall . In one episode that I can recall , Crosby's scheme deals with hiding a large animal ( an elephant I believe ) in the hotel without Harris finding out . He convinces "" Jimenez "" to help "" gaslight "" Harris , making him believe he is hallucinating or failing to see things ( one of the funny bits in the episode is Harris repeatedly trying to act as though nothing is happening to him , but also holding onto walls and banisters to support himself in his illness ! ) . The climax is that Dana and Crosby and the elephant are on the hotel's sun roof when Harris comes upon them . Harris is wondering what the elephant is doing on the roof when they convince there is no elephant , but the distant Empire State Building . Remembering previous hallucinations he has had , Harris is buying this , when some other people turn up on the roof , and ask him what the elephant is doing there . "" Oh , that's not an elephant , but the Empire State Building ! "" he announces , before it dawns on him that they are seeing the same thing he just thought he saw . It was , as another account on the thread suggests , bad writing that hurt the show . It was not that the show could not rise , but it rose above due to the three or four leads . Dana is actually a good character actor ( you may recall he had a running role on THE GOLDEN GIRLS as Estelle Getty's younger brother . . . and he was quite funny in the role ) . In one episode his so-called stereotype actually showed some gumption . An episode dealt with the problem that "" Jose "" and Gary Crosby have with a spoiled heiress at the hotel . Besides the normal demands she puts on their service , she's mean enough to play humiliating pranks on them for her and her friends entertainment . Finally , "" Jose "" actually ( if in his gentle manner ) tells her off to the extent of being a spoiled brat . In the episode Harris has tried to keep the staff in line about accepting this brat's behavior until she leaves , so when "" Jose "" tells her off he lectures "" Jose "" about not insulting the guests . As it turns out , the girl's father shows up and thanks "" Jose "" for not being like so many other employees : being too obsequious to his bratty daughter . Harris of course is amazed by this turn about . It was not a great series , but it certainly had a few good moments due to its leads . It also showed us ( briefly ) that Gary Crosby had some of his dad's acting talents ( his manipulations of "" Jose "" remind me of Bing's manipulations of Bob Hope in the ROAD pictures ) . Unfortunately , unlike Harris , Adams , and Dana there was no real follow up for Gary , who made news before he died by trashing his old man in a memoir .

Text2: This is one of the films at Paramount ( with EASY MONEY & REMEMBER THE NIGHT ) that Mitchell Leisin was criticized by the screenwriters ( Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett , and Preston Sturgis ) for altering the pacing or direction of the screenplays . He didn't . Leisin was never as cynical as either Wilder or Sturgis , and tended to soften the central characters of his comedies by showing them as human beings . This is true with how he handled Wilder and Brackett's "" Eve Peabody "" ( Claudette Colbert ) , who is a showgirl / gold-digger who lucks out because a wealthy banker George Flammarion ( John Barrymore ) needs her to help him win back his wife Helene ( Mary Astor ) . MIDNIGHT is the "" Cinderella "" story . Colbert has come to Paris with nothing but the clothes she has on her . She meets a cab driver ( Don Ameche as "" Tibor Czerny "" ) who is willing to help stake her until she can find work . But Colbert ( although she obviously likes Ameche ) is determined to take Paris by storm first , and runs away from him - managing to get into a social event . It is a soirée held by Hedda Hopper ( one of her few movie roles ) , where she keeps annoying the pianist by introducing his piece as a Prelude , when it is an Etude . Barrymore is there with Astor , and with her boy-friend ( Francis Lederer as Jacques Picot ) , as well as Astor's gay confidante Rex O'Malley ( as Marcel Renaud ) . Lederer keeps looking very interested at Colbert ( much to Astor's increasing annoyance ) , and Barrymore notes this . He asks Colbert a few questions , and accepts her answers . Like another Eve in a later film , Colbert does not know enough to keep her comments simple and non-committal . But as the party breaks up , a limousine is there to pick up Colbert and take her to a ritzy hotel suite as Baroness Czerny . After she wanders stunned through the opulent apartments , Barrymore shows up . After pointing out her error about various answers she gave him ( you will learn about the oldest subway in Europe ) , Barrymore explains why he has set her up ( and will back her ) . He wants her to attract Lederer away from Astor , whom Barrymore loves deeply but who is infatuated with the younger man . Colbert agrees , but only because she may end up marrying the wealthy Lederer ( his fortune is from an inferior champaign , but Barrymore says that "" Everytime his champaign is bought , his fortune bubbles ! "" ) . Ameche of course is busy looking for Colbert , and eventually finds her . He confronts her at the Flammarion mansion , and claims he is the husband of the "" Baroness "" . This , of course , adds a complication to the plans of Barrymore ( who tries to derail Ameche repeatedly ) . In the end the entire matter has to go to divorce court . Unfortunately it is run by that stickler for law , order , and the French home : Monty Wooley . And how it is resolved I will leave to the viewer to discover . It is a witty little film , due in part to the Wilder and Brackett script , but also the master hand of Leisin in getting performances out of his actors - including John Barrymore in his last good performance in a supporting role . Reportedly Barrymore read his lines from cue cards just off the set ( he explained that he would not memorize lines from a Hollywood script - only from a classic play ) . Still look at his moments of zaniness pretending he is the Czerny's child , or in making little sniping remarks at O'Malley's expense . He still could act quite well at this point . Ameche and Colbert also have good timing , and chemistry together . Colbert even has a moment of humanness ( that Leisin added ) where she explains her avariciousness is based on seeing how her parents grew to hate each other in their mutually entrapped poverty row marriage . Wilder normally never got points like that into his films , nor did Sturgis . It is a wonderful comedy , and one of the best screwball films of the 1930s . Pity it is not as well known as it should be .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
958,"Text1: Want to know why pornographic films are so popular ? It's nothing to do with the sex ( I think I speak for many of us when I say sex shouldn't be a spectator sport ) , it's all to do with the awful dubbing which makes for great hilarity . You know what I'm talking about , when a male character sees his female co-star for the first time a voice ( Which sounds suspicously like it belongs to the English royal family ) can be heard saying "" Well hi there baby , you're a pretty young thing "" while the actor's mouth can clearly be seen mouthing the words "" Oh my god , what a scanky dog , no wonder I'm gay "" . In other words ( Geddit ? ) overdubbing can be sidesplittingly funny - But only if it's used in porn filmsThis fact seems to have escaped the notice of the producers of KUNG POW : ENTER THE FIST who have decided to take some obscure Hong Kong movie and redub and edit it into this alleged comedy and I can't emphasize enough how the comedy fails . I'm actually shocked that no-one came to the conclusion that this might have been funny for a skit lasting two minutes but this movie lasts almost for an hour and a half . It's absolutely pitiful that humour in this movie is composed of people making funny noises like "" Whhhheeee "" and "" Oooohhh "" . Yes that's right that's what the humour involves and before anyone asks "" But Theo isn't this a martial arts spoof like SCARY MOVIE is a horror spoof ? "" , well all I can say that's what the ad-men want you to believe down to the number of trailers featuring a cow in a fight scene ripped off from THE MATRIX . The cynic in me ( And no dirty jokes please , the porn topic is finished ) believes that the producers only filmed that scene so they could put it in the trailer and make everyone believe they'd be seeing a martial arts equivilent of SCARY MOVIE . False advertising I think it's calledI was dying to give this , but I did like the theme tune by Mint Royale which is the same track used in the punch up scene from the GET CARTER remake so I'm going to give it , but even so it's still one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time .

Text2: THE WORLD AT WAR is regarded as perhaps the greatest documentary series ever made , but I watch documentaries all the time on The History Channel that are almost every bit as good as this . The one major criticism I have about TWAW is the opening instalment A NEW GERMANY which shows us a newly installed National Socialist government in Germany . I'm not defending fascism but how can a highly regarded series like this not show us any context that brought Hitler to power ? People in Germany turned to Nazism because the victorious allied powers made everyone in 1920s Germany pay a heavy price for loosing the first world war , something the programme fails to emphasise . And on a very ambiguous point is the role of the Soviet Union during the war . TWAW rightfully points out the contribution made by the USSR via episodes like STALINGRAD and RED STAR as the Soviet war machine being the major factor in the defeat of Nazism , but fails to heavily emphasise that much of the shocking loses suffered by the Soviets was down to the military incompetence of Stalin . I don't want to give the impression that I dislike THE WORLD AT WAR , I don't ( And I do recognise that both the theme music by Carl Davis and the title sequence are classics ) , but it's impossible to be objective about history , and that's maybe the problem , the series goes out of its way to give everyone their view on the Second World War and this makes it just too objective though paradoxically that's also one of the programmes strengths , the episode WHIRLWIND ( Which I rate the best in the series ) covers the allied bombing of Germany and features interviews with William Reid a RAF bomber pilot who won the Victoria Cross ( Britain's highest military decoration ) during a bomber raid , then cuts to an interview with film star James Stewart who spent the war with the USAAF 8th airforce , then interviews people who history has forgotten like the people who survived bombing by the British and US air raids .

959,"Text1: I just bought a DVD with About Last Night and St . Elmo's Fire both on it , for five dollars , I figured they might be worth a look . I watched St . Elmo's fire last night and I have to say that I was very impressed . Like About Last Night , this is still a very important story to this day . I have to say that both these films got to me very much because I have had to deal with the exact same situation , a relationship that had to find more than the physical attraction and now that I'm 22 , dealing with an adult life . St . Elmo's Fire deals with the scary and nerve wrecking times transcending from the college life style to young adulthood . Going into a career and possible family is a lot harder than it looks , and that's what our brat pack friends have to deal with . A group of friends who have just graduated college are now facing the real world of discovering who they are . We have a couple who are in a relationship where the man wants to get married but is fooling around and the girl doesn't want to marry him . We have a girl , Jules , who is having financial troubles and is using her looks to get what she wants . We have a man , Kirby , who is obsessed with a love from childhood . Another guy , Billy , who can't grow up despite him having a child and wife . A girl , Wendy , who is learning not to rely on her father's money and is still going through the awkward faze of her looks . And last but not least , Kevin , who is in love with his best friend's girlfriend and is also a writer . St . Elmo's Fire is a good film and I know that this was one of Joel Schumacher's first films , he did a decent job I think . It's in some ways an important film of today and also is a classic in it's own right . It's one of the major brat pack films and also brought together a great story that everyone could relate too in some way . Despite how dated it is , it's a timeless story of the fears that we face having to grow up . Not too many people pay attention to this hard time in a young adult's life , so St . Elmo's Fire is a great way of taking a look at the situation . It's a good film and I recommend it .

Text2: I wouldn't argue with anyone who said that Springtime in the Rockies might just be Betty Grable's best film . It certainly has a lot going for it . The plot's a skimpy one as these types of films are . Betty's in love with her act partner John Payne who says he reciprocates , but can't get pinned down for marriage . After a performance in their show , she and Payne get into one fight too many and she takes off for an engagement with her former partner Cesar Romero in a resort on the shore of Lake Louise in those beautiful Canadian Rockies . No one got near Lake Louise from 20th Century Fox . A few establishing shots of the lake with the mountains behind are all you see . Of course John Payne chases after her with some mixed motives . He wants to marry her , but he also wants her for a new show . He takes his own scenic route to Lake Louise , flying under his own power as well as by plane and finds when he both arrives and sobers up he's hired himself a secretary in Carmen Miranda and a valet in Edward Everett Horton . Betty gets to make her first appearance on screen with her new husband , Harry James and his orchestra . Just prior and during World War II was the era of the big bands and all the studios tried to sign them up and shoe horn them into films . It was an easy fit in this case for Harry James . Especially with a score from Harry Warren and Mack Gordon who provided James with one of his biggest hits . I Had The Craziest Dream . Played by the band with inimitable James trumpet and sung beautifully by Helen Forrest this was one of the biggest song hits of the World War II years . It still plays beautifully today . Carmen Miranda does a couple of numbers in her unique style , you haven't lived until you've heard her do Chattanooga Choo Choo in Portugese . And in this wonderful cast in a small role is Jackie Gleason as Payne's agent . It's sad that in this wonderful cast , Gleason had a most nondescript part that shows absolutely nothing of his comic abilities . There's nothing deep about Springtime in the Rockies , it's just fabulous entertainment with a cast you could never assemble like this today .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
960,"Text1: I remember listening to Rodney Bingenheimer's radio show on KROQ when I was in high school . I knew nothing of him at the time and only know what I know now because of what I learned from this movie , but regardless of how popular Rodney became with the rock stars and celebrities and regardless of how well his show ever did , the guy just does not have a voice for radio . I think that in his case it is vital that you know him personally or that you know about his history in the music business , because listening to him as a radio talk show host is intolerably boring . It is not a surprise , to say the least , that his radio show never strayed far from the midnight to 3am shift on Sundays , although I would rather listen to him than Jed the Fish any day of the week . Jed the Fish irritates the hell out of me . Speaking of which , one of the more interesting things that I learned from this documentary was actually just proof of something that I had always suspected , that Jed the Fish has always been faking that ridiculous accent that he always talks with on the air . In his brief interviews in the movie he makes the mistake of talking in his regular voice , revealing how much of a fake he really is . On the other hand , he is , in fact , an entertainer , so I don't want to give the impression that he is some kind of fraud because he talks with a fake accent on the air . He's been on KROQ for some ridiculous number of years , so he must be doing something right . Not my thing , I guess . I think I may have just developed this contempt for KROQ for ruining great songs and popularizing bad songs in the ten years or so since I first moved to Irvine and started listening to them . The thing that I really liked about this documentary is that it really gives good insight into the life of Rodney Bingenheimer , who seems like some geeky guy who made his way into rock stardom by a simple love of music and what must have been a very disarming and unusually charming demeanor . For some reason he reminds me of this 1978 Honda Civic that I had in high school , it was the crappiest car in the parking lot but everyone loved it . I remember lots all the hot Flygirls used to always want to drive it , it was like a toy . Interpret that as you will , I still haven't figured it out . There are moments in the film when I almost felt bad for being so bored by Rodney's radio program , because despite having been experienced far more than every high school kid's dreams of the , ah , fleshy pearls of rock and roll decadence , Rodney has been through a lot of pain in his life . He had some truly heartbreaking experiences in his life growing up , which are kind of manifested in scenes like the one where he goes to visit his parents , with whom he had something of a falling out , and finds that they don't have any pictures of him in the front room . The saddest thing is that he brings the camera crew into a back room and points to a picture of himself , framed on hung on the wall but almost hidden in a corner where no one would ever see it . And he acted like it was perfectly normal . Rodney's demeanor that thing that really leaves the film open to interpretation . Despite having just watched a documentary about the guy , I feel like I know less about him than I knew before , just because he is such a closed off kind of person . There are scenes when he genuinely loses his temper , and there are scenes where he is clearly uncomfortable and comes right out and says that he doesn't want to talk about certain things , but at the same time he discloses information about himself that almost anyone else would probably find embarrassing . This is one of the rare instances in documentary film-making where you can learn so much about a person but come away from it amazed at how little you really know about him . It's like the old saying , the more I learn , the more I realize I don't know . Rodney is a truly unique person with a truly unique personality , and while I can't claim to have been entertained by his radio show even for a minute , he is certainly a fascinating person to learn about . Especially since I went to high school listening to the kind of music that he introduced to the world and I now live in the area that is portrayed in the movie . All music fans should watch this .

Mom dies and a new family - - father Dabney Coleman , mother Pippa Scott , and their three hottie daughters Cindy Fisher , Cindy Eibacher and Lisa Eibacher - - move into the swanky and enormous abode . Ronald loses his grip on reality and disappears into an elaborate fantasy world created by his own warped overactive imagination .

One of the all-time classic 70's made-for-TV horror psycho thrillers , "" Bad Ronald "" ' s extremely fantastic and far-fetched premise is made reasonably credible and totally compelling by journeyman TV show veteran Buzz Kulik's capable direction ( along with his episodic TV show credits , Kulik also helmed the enjoyable Burt Reynolds private eye picture "" Shamus "" and the underrated Steve McQueen action vehicle "" The Hunter "" ) . Fred Karlin's effectively eerie score and a top-rate cast make this feature a cut above average TV movie fare . Popping up in especially nice bits are John Larch as a shrewd homicide detective and John Fiedler as a friendly real estate agent . Yeah , this film is fairly preposterous , but thankfully Jacoby's unforgettably creepy and disturbing character keeps the show gripping and harrowing right down to its thrilling climax .

If their plan all along was to make the regular Simpsons TV show and make it progressively more and more awful , such as the case of the series for the last 7 years , and get it to the point of sub-par barely watchable shell of the glory that it once was . And if they did all that JUST to come out with this movie that while never NEVER reaching the classic status of Simpsons yesteryear , yet still much better then the series proper is only to have it viewed as some kind of Oscar-worthy film . Well all I can say is very well played indeed sirs . For those of us that remember how good the series truly was , this bit of fluff involving Homer dooming the the town of Springfield due to his shenanigans , this film was not really made for us and will feel rather repetitive ( IE : Homer and Marge fighting AGAIN , Lisa finding a crush AGAIN , even a few jokes are repeated from the series ) but rather the newer fans who started watching it at the start of this millennium ( yes i know , I shudder at that thought as well ) The fact that this film is currently in the top 100 when it has no business in even IMDb's top 250 is both sad and supremely mind-boggling . But again if one is fed a steady diet of feces and then given a moldy stale pork rind , it'd likely taste like top cuisine .

962,"Text1: Some will say - actually a lot have said - that Oliver Stone's new film on the public history of George W . Bush , the man and the 43rd President , will be slanted or with scenes that show the clear bias of the filmmaker . What happens in W . is that it is and it isn't a sign of bias . Unlike with Nixon , who was a complex man and could be treated in a different way , Bush is actually fairly straightforward as a person , as a leader , as a son , as a ' rehabilitated ' servant of the Lord . The portrayal of Bush is , actually , is not unfair , but in the process it shows the George W . Bush to be exactly what he is to any and all audiences , and this makes it more interesting and ( somewhat more ) challenging . If you feel like Bush should be impeached and / or ' taken out ' for all of the atrocities upon atrocities he with his administration has committed in the past eight years , you'll think it's not enough shown in the film . If you're on the other side of the coin , whoever you might be , it's kind of cruel and lampoon-like . To me , it's a finely stated psychological horror story with gallows-humor . Does this mean that W . is a great film ? No , it's not . Stone indulges from time to time in the kind of stylistic choices that veer close to being a TV movie - nowhere near as much or as sappy as the Hallmark-channel spread World Trade Center , but with a couple of obvious music choices - and the criticism put on the movie that there's nothing really new that those reasonably informed about Bush's past and his first term is not completely unwarranted . But , again , there is the expectation going in that this will be the be-all-end-all of lambasting , or on the flip-side that it's too soon an analysis of a man still ( not too arguably ) crippling the country away in his last months in office . What Stone has done , occasionally brilliantly , is compile a Greatest-Hits of Bush trivia and scenes that are either spot-on to how they likely played out or are based very accurately on what is at the date known about what happened behind closed doors with Bush and Cheney and Rove and company . On top of this is a story of , in a famous-movie comparison , what would happen if Fredo Corleone got the chance to be a mob boss while his disapproving father was still alive and smarter brother got more respect ( it's not beyond comprehension to hear the echo of "" I can run things , I'm smart ! "" from Godfather 2 in certain scenes with George and his father ) . While this could possibly fall into , as just a movie , into cliché , Stone and his casting director have , not entirely without coincidence , compiled the best casted Stone picture since 1995's Nixon . Josh Brolin is clearly now on the A-list following last year's mix and match of thrillers ( Grindhouse , American Gangster , No Country ) , and his performance solidifies his reputation as an actor so convincing and in touch with the not-quite transformation of George W . Bush that he makes him , if not entirely sympathetic , understandable and human and not some complete villain . There's also a gallery of who's-who in the acting pool : James Cromwell , Richard Dreyfuss ( exceptional ) , Jeffrey Wright , Ellen Burstyn , Thandie Newton , Toby Young , even Rob Corddry from the Daily Show , all of them are spectacular in their parts , adding interest to scenes that require presence , strength , and from time to time nuance and care in finding that line between playing a character and parody ( which , actually , Newton verges into a few times ) . It's also been said that W . is actually a funny movie , maybe one of Stone's few outright comedies . The trailer and the TV commercials have made this to look so , and I laughed a bunch of times at them in that context since they were in skit-format . In the context of the film , where the weight of very current history and wars still being waged and blunder and horror accumulating , a lot of the humor is either by a quick goof or what comes off like , as said , gallows humor . This could in fact be a crazy American Bunuel picture if it weren't true ; it's the kind of dark bourgeois horror-comedy in a sense that you laugh almost out of exasperation , but at the same time stuff one might find funny out of context ( i . e . choking on a pretzel ) is treated with an amount of actual gravitas . It's not that I couldn't see how it's maybe too simple a task to show a lot of what we already know - the power-hungry conflict in the administration , the Bush / Bush Jr conflict , the dangerous change-up from all alcohol to all Jesus - but at the same time it's revealed in the best kind of pop-melodrama , as a serious story of a man who is , in all actually , not at all complicated . It won't be a popular movie by any stretch , but it took some guts to present it as such .

Text2: When Claude Chabrol , the French director of many thrillers and dramas and other genres , is at his best when subtly but forcefully pulling the rug out from the viewer . This isn't your usual case of a romance story criss-crossed with a serial killer thriller . In fact , we're not made very much aware that there is a serial killer - save for a few mentions here and there - until halfway through the movie , and by the time we are it's full-throttle in a kind of expertly manipulated suspense , not in the usual sense but through an ominous musical score by Pierre Jansen and a movement of fluidity with the camera that tells the story sort of conventionally but not at the same time . It's a small , master's class in subverting the genre by making us care so much about the characters even as we know they're doomed from the happy opening . That's not to say that Chabrol has made anything that can't be enjoyed by one looking for a good entertaining thriller first and foremost . If anything the opening of the movie is what lures one in perfectly , as it's a very jovial in this wedding sequence one sees guests school-teacher Helene ( Stephane Audran , Chabrol regular ) and butcher Paul ( Jean Yanne , perfect as the butcher ) , enjoying themselves and making good conversation . This stretches out into the first half of the film ; a friendship develops around food that Paul brings over , and it's only when Paul thinks its time to go the ' next step ' that he's told it can't be because of a past horrible relationship that Helen faced - horrible in the sense of disappointment . There's a disconnect emotionally that is left open , thus , going into the second half of the film , where finally we see what some of us would be waiting for : the serial killer plot . There's a string of murders involving women , and one of them - the bride from the opening - is a shocker not exactly for the revelation itself , per-say , but how Chabrol builds up to it . At first it's seen as the most suspenseful thing in the film so far as Helen leads her class along a mountainside and stops to have lunch . The music is playing right here , and it's really chilling for how simple it lays out the tension , like a weirdo standing across the street in a black cloak acting suspicious but , at the same time , too subtle to pin down . This adds to the sudden shock , then , after the music stops and finally the reveal happens via blood dripping on the kid's sandwich . This , however , is just one example of Chabrol's calm mastery as a director of the material . It would be one thing to go on and on about the eerie absorption of the camera-work , which goes between conventional stylization ( for a French film of the period ) and poetic editing and framing . Or to go on and on about the stunning work turned by Audran ( going between an entire emotional palette , as it were , from happy to sobbing to frightened to pale and shot to hell ) and Yanne ( also great at what he's meant to be , our male protagonist and , sadly , eventual antagonist by default ) . But it's the emotional struggle that makes this compelling above all other good reasons to recommend . The Butcher posits a relationship that is platonic , naturalistic , and genuinely interesting ; these aren't cookie-cutter characters but well-drawn and with things that make them identifiable even as they , early on , seem to go on about trivial things not related to the plot ( a little like a Woody Allen movie ) . Then , when it switches gears bit by bit and the paranoia increases , by the time the climax comes it becomes very , ultimately , tragic . Chabrol goes to lengths to reveal , simply , the soul of a man one should not feel any sympathy for . That one close-up in the car ride to the hospital is one of the finest climaxes I might ever see in a movie from Europe , even anywhere . And damned if isn't representative of what Chabrol can do as a craftier but no less true-to-his-art member of the Cashier du cinema filmmaker club .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
963,"Text1: A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . A curvaceous young insect attracts the attentions of a boy MOTH AND THE FLAME of a candle , both of whom want to possess her for different reasons . The flame proving practically inextinguishable , the resulting fiery melee is not settled until further night fliers swarm to the rescue . Without any great technical innovations or underlying social themes , this pleasant , perky little cartoon seemingly exists purely for entertainment . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .

As his tale continues , it wraps back to enfold Welles and the viewer in its skein of mystery - inviting us all to RETURN TO GLENNASCAUL . . . In 1951 , during a hiatus in the production of his OTHELLO , two of the actors in the Shakespearean film asked Welles , their old friend , to appear in a short film they were producing . They were Hilton Edwards & Micheál Mac Liammóir , the founders of the famed Dublin Gate Theatre . They thought Welles would be the perfect choice to tell their little ghost tale . They were right - his magnificent voice still worked its magic as it had in radio's heyday . Others in the cast , all excellent , were Michael Laurence ( also on leave from OTHELLO ) , Shelah Richards & Helena Hughes .

This movie has a few similarities with the original , though not many . Mainly the name and the fact the survivors find refuge in a mall are the main similarities . This is fine by me because I do not want to watch the same movie again . The zombies here are fast , sort of like the zombies in "" Return of the Living Dead "" or "" Nightmare City "" , but they are still stupid and can be killed with a bullet to the brain . They are also a lot better than the ones in "" 28 Days Later "" though they were not really zombies .

Text2: The mid-to-late ' 60's saw a sea change in British film comedy , as it moved away from family entertainment and became more risqué . Television provided inspiration , with many films being either based on or inspired by popular shows . ' Every Home Should Have One ' grew out of the B . B . C . series ' Marty ' , and although made in 1970 is very much a ' 60's piece . Feldman proved here he had the talent to carry a film , supported by a first-rate cast including Judy Cornwell , Dinsdale Landen , and Penelope Keith . Alan Bennett puts in an uncredited cameo as a befuddled barrister . The film lampoons the glossy but shallow world of advertising , but also takes pot-shots at moralising politicians , clean-up television campaigners , and the permissive society in general .

Mr . Ogata is the main character , and he and his cronies make pornographic films , and what wonderful casts & crews they seem to round up . For anyone that thinks Japan is a polite society where everyone is well mannered , etc . , think again . We even have a young woman cast as a school girl who's a bit "" slow "" says her dad , well , no , she's retarded . Of course they use her anyway because she's "" the right age "" . This is a dark black comedy , and features a woman and her two children that Mr . Ogata lives with and supports , and none of them would apparently be the bedrocks of mental health , either . The young man has a thing for his mom , the young girl is rather "" wild "" , and the woman is not very well , either mentally or physically , it would seem , and keeps the reincarnated spirit of her dead husband in a tank , because he came back as a carp . Mr . Ogata goes about his life in a rather stoic , matter-of-fact way that's so deadpan that it makes the humor in this even better . I did have a bit of trouble keeping up with who was who on occasion because this also jumps time periods a few times as well . There are a few scenes in this that were quite "" arty "" , I guess you'd say , and the use of music and the stark way they were presented makes them really stand out in my mind .

I would recommend this to fans of Asian cinema , and maybe even a few more adventurous types . .

Text2: I know that Cage's last film , Adaptation , was not as warmly accepted by everyone as it was by me , but I feel that it was one of the most intelligent and creative films to be released in a long time , and with Matchstick Men , he assumes a role in another extremely well-made and well thought-out film . I remember seeing the preview , in which Cage's character learns that he has a teenage daughter from a long dead relationship and , being a con-man , ends up being convinced by her to teach her something of his trade . At the time , I expected his character to be something more similar to his character in Snake Eyes than Adaptation - a smooth talking , fast paced kind of guy who knows what he wants and how to get it . Needless to say , it came as a surprise to see his character in Matchstick Men literally incapacitated by something as simple as someone leaving a sliding glass door open . I can kind of relate to that little quirk , in a way , because in movies , for example , when someone jumps out of a car and leaves the door open or doesn't answer a ringing phone it drives me nuts . ( spoilers ) About midway through the film , I was simply waiting for it to end . I was completely convinced that Cage was going to do one last score , his daughter would get taken hostage or something , he would have to give up his biggest payoff ever to save the life of this little girl that he just met , and he would suddenly find it within himself to give up his life of crime and start being a legitimate and loving father . Maybe he and his wife would even get back together , I was just waiting for it . Thankfully , the movie takes a completely different direction and , while I still find some of the details of the conclusion slightly hard to believe , it was great to see something so fresh and original and entertaining . There were spectacular performances in this film , the comic relief was abundant and effective , and the film never once panders to exactly what the audience wants to see . So here are the problems that I can see people having with this film . It might be seen as one of those movies that deliberately leads the audience in the wrong direction and then pops this twist on them at the end , and while that may not be completely untrue , it doesn't do it in a way that leaves you feeling cheated . Every movie with a successful twist has to lead you in the wrong direction to a certain extent , but it is whether or not it was obvious or at least cleverly crafted that makes the difference , and Matchstick Men is VERY cleverly crafted . Perhaps more pressing than the concern of leading the audience in the wrong direction , Matchstick Men does , in fact , have a problem with being a little bit too convenient . It is a very complex story , which makes it extremely entertaining , but this also gives it the feeling ( especially when the girl happens to walk into her father's work at the carpet store at the end of the film ) that everything just worked out too perfectly . Sure , deciding to buy carpet with her loser boyfriend at just the wrong carpet store is perfectly plausible , it may seem strange that she did it exactly six months after ripping him off . But of course , as always , Nicholas Cage delivers a great performance as the slightly disturbed but highly amusing Roy Waller , and Sam Rockwell draws on some of his best performances , especially his performance as Billy the Kid in The Green Mile , and takes the best parts while still adding new dimensions to his iconography . Outstanding .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: This is two tales fused together by Ernest Borgnaine .

It looks rather bad when they switch to Merlin from time to time when he is in 1996 asking people if they have seen his monkey . The monkey kills by banging cymbals , actually it reminded me of a Stephen King story I read . The monkey kills a kid's dog and goldfish , and even makes an attempt at the kid .

Text2: I have to imagine that in order for MGM to justify using two of their top leading men with Joan Crawford , their parts in Forsaking All Others would have to have been built up considerably . The original Broadway production of this comedy that ran 110 performances in 1933 starred Tallulah Bankhead and it was strictly her show . As if it would have been any other way . I have to give Joan Crawford credit on this one . Unlike her later film Susan and God where she tries to imitate Gertrude Lawrence with accent and all , she wisely does not try to do a Tallulah impersonation . She creates her own character here and it's a good one . She's got both Robert Montgomery and Clark Gable after her , but she chooses early on and in the end she finds out she chooses wrong . In fact the only impersonation Crawford does is one of her Grand Hotel co-star Greta Garbo . Both Clark Gable and Robert Montgomery settle into familiar stereotypes for them . Gable is another reporter character like he is It Happened One Night and Montgomery is an irresponsible playboy like he was in a gazillion films . Montgomery and Crawford are set to be married , but Montgomery leaves her at the altar and runs off with his demanding mistress Frances Drake . But Crawford has Gable's shoulder to cry on for most of the rest of the film . By the way , Drake gives a performance that's a case study in canine feminus . She makes Joan Collins in Dynasty look like Maria Von Trapp . Drake dominates in whatever scene she's in . No way that Tallulah Bankhead would have let that happen on stage . Charles Butterworth and Billie Burke are also on hand and young Rosalind Russell on her way up has a small part as one of Crawford's friends .

971,"Text1: Finally , after watching literally hundreds of westerns , score one for the bad guy ! Bruce Dern's character is Jack Strawhorn , a savvy train robber with enough sense in the early going to know that his gang was second best to Marshal Howard Nightingale's ( Kirk Douglas ) lawmen . Savvy enough also to allow himself to be captured than to foolishly throw down with Nightingale when he had the upper hand . Strawhorn's capture virtually assures Nightingale of an election win for a U . S . Senate seat , a position he's angling for with a lot more ambition on his mind than simply serving the people . As the story plays out though , things get a whole lot murkier , so much so that the finale winds up totally at odds with any sense of credibility . Granted , Nightingale's men spend a fair amount of time worrying about what will happen to them should he pack up for Washington , D . C . Here's what bothers me though - whose payroll were they actually on to begin with ? They were uniformed officers and all wore stars ; Nightingale's title was that of a Marshal . So why wouldn't they have remained no worse off than their present circumstances ? I can understand them shaking down the town to save the life of their boss , but then to turn around and split up the money just because Strawhorn suggested it just doesn't make sense to me . Other than the ending that proved a letdown for this viewer , the film does have some fine points to offer . The cinematography is more than adequate , and the hijacked train on fire was an exciting touch . There are also two outstanding scenes where horses go above and beyond the call of duty . The first involves a mount going over a cliff and into the water at the Mexican camp , and later when Styrawhorn attempts his getaway from the train on horseback . How does one get a horse to take those crazy spills ? Pay attention to the scene when Strawhorn plans his breakout on the train . He rigs a garrote from a piece of wire taken apart from a broom and lashes Wesley ( Bo Hopkins ) tightly by the neck to the bars of the cell . Later when Wesley answers Strawhorn's call to come to his room where Nightingale is kept hostage , there isn't even the slightest hint of redness or abrasion on his neck from the event . One other comment bears mentioning that came across unintentionally funny . The train bearing Nightingale's posse is clearly marked as the Texas and Arizona Rail Road . While stationed at the town of Tesota , three of Nightingale's randy men entertain women folk of the town in secluded quarters . Interestingly , there's a shot of one of the train cars with the abbreviated name - ' T . & A . R . R . ' For Wesley and the boys , it certainly was .

Text2: Mario Bava himself repeatedly stated that this is the worst film he was ever involved in , so luckily enough there still are some loyal and naive fan-boys ( like myself ) to reassure the public that "" 5 Dolls for an August Moon "" nonetheless remains a worthy purchase and definitely better than your average horror / mystery from the early 70's . Even though this giallo can't possibly reach the brilliance-level of nearly every other Bava film ( the list is enormous , with "" Black Sabbath , Kill Baby ? Kill "" , "" Blood and Black Lace , "" Black Sunday "" ? ) , it's a light-headed and often ingenious effort . The plot is a very simple variation on Agatha Christie's "" Ten Little Indians "" , set on an island inhabited by rich and utterly greedy bastards . The island's owner , George Stark , invited a bunch of businessmen and their wives over for a weekend of million-dollar-deals and adultery . One of the guests invented a groundbreaking formula ( something about resin ) and the others make it a sport to bid the most money for it . They aren't even ashamed to throw in their sexy wives as an extra . The party really gets interesting once the invitees ' bodies turn up brutally murdered one by one . "" 5 Dolls for an August Moon "" indeed looks more like a satire instead of a suspenseful giallo and it's obvious that Bava didn't put much devotion into it . The murders are mainly committed off screen but the emphasis lies on the comical storage of the cadavers , namely in a meat-locker and clumsily wrapped in plastics . The dialogs are weak yet almost the entire film is foreseen of a jazzy soundtrack , which actually makes "" 5 Dolls for an August Moon "" Bava's most swinging horror movie ( the über-cool "" Danger : Diabolik "" is falls into a class of its own ) . The totally unpredictable twist at the end is fantastic , in my opinion . The cast is more than interesting , particularly because the unearthly beautiful Edwige Fenech hops around in bikinis and lingerie most of the time . She's a good actress , but she's even a better nude model . For just this one time , don't listen to the master-director himself and watch this film !

972,"Text1: The Butterfly Effect , unfortunately marketed as most notable because of a turn from idiot comedy to strong dramatic performance by Ashton Kutcher , begins with a title explaining one of the tenets of Chaos Theory , specifically that a butterfly flapping its wings starts a chain reaction of events that can result in a hurricane on the other side of the planet . Interestingly , a theory which has almost nothing to do with this movie . This movie is not about a butterfly flapping its wings and causing a hurricane tens of thousands of miles away , it's about a butterfly that flaps its wings , deciding to fly intself toward a deadly spiderweb or toward a safe open field of sweet flowers , and the effects that that single decision has on that same butterfly's future life , not on the weather occurrences on the other side of the planet . Kutcher plays Evan Treborn , a kid who inherited a thinly described mental disorder from his father , who has lived most of Evan's life in a hospital for the criminally insane . The specifics of his disorder are not important , as the effects are explained by the movie . We meet Evan as a young boy , creating concerns among the school staff by drawing a picture of a knife-wielding person standing over a lot of bloody corpses when asked to draw a picture of what he wanted to be when he grew up . Grisly , yes , but the artistic ability in the drawing is stunning . It should have been more childishly drawn were it's artistic competence to garner not a single mention from the teachers so worried about it . In order to work toward a solution to the problem , the school psychologist suggests having Evan begin to keep a journal , sort of as a way to map out his thoughts and see if they might be able to find out what happens in the periods when Evan ' loses the time , ' as Aaron Stampler from Primal Fear described his similar experiences . These journals later in Evan's life provide him the opportunity to sort of mentally travel through time and change occurrences that happened in order to change the disastrous future . When I think about the change brought about by the small things that Evan goes back and changes , I'm reminded of a film released last year called Thirteen ( which , at the time of this writing , I haven't seen ) . Parents may find themselves disturbed at how Thirteen presents how easily a perfect daughter can be turned horribly wrong by hanging out with the wrong people . Incidentally , this is where a thin version of the above-mentioned Chaos Theory comes into play in The Butterfly Effect . The difference between a butterfly causing a hurricane by flapping its wings and the chains of events in this movie is that the butterfly flapping its wings falls victim to a fallacy of logical thinking called ' post hoc , ergo prompter hoc ' ( ' After this , therefore because of this ' ) . Certainly an interesting theory , but one that can never be proven because no hurricane could ever be traced back to a single event that , had it never taken place , might have resulted in the absence of the hurricane . The Butterfly Effect's version is much simpler . The path of life has many forks , and different choices in life lead to different futures . A Simpson's episode that dealt with this exact idea comes to mind . In an amusing alteration of a famous science fiction story , Homer manages to build a time machine out of something that only he could build a time machine from ? a toaster . Back in the time of the dinosaurs , he accidentally squishes a bug , then travels back to the present to find the world totally transformed . Ned Flanders as the all-powerful diddly-dictator , his family extremely classy but without the existence of donuts ( too much for Homer to bear , so he tragically travels back again to fix it before realizing that donuts fall from the sky like rain ) , they're back to normal but eat with their tongues like lizards , etc . Each time he travels back in time , he changes something and returns to the present to find things completely different . The difference in The Butterfly Effect is that the things that Evan changes affect only him and his friends , and apparently no one else . Evan has grown up to be a productive college student , studying psychology in hopes of learning something about his troubled past . I won't go into how odd it is that he reveals deeply disturbing things about himself as well as having been forced to perform in a child pornography video and yet nothing ever came of it ( maybe no one ever read his journals , just like they never noticed his obvious artistic brilliance because they were too concerned over his extensive use of the red crayon ? ) , because the important thing is that he is later able to read through these old journal entries as a sort of portal to travel back to the time at which they were written so that he can change events that had tragic affects on the lives of him and his friends . There are scenes in The Butterfly Effect that are genuinely scary , and the film itself has a thoroughly creepy feel throughout ( not the least reason for which is a gigantic amount of hugely disturbing scenes involving the characters as children - many of which went beyond the extent necessary in order to get their point across ) . These are , incidentally , the reason that the film at many points becomes campy and callous , surely inspiring a good portion of the many negative reviews of the film . Little kids acting in ways that little kids are not supposed to act can be pretty funny , that's why South Park was such a huge hit , but I could certainly have done with significantly less profanity and violence from them ( maybe a few less vicious death threats and one or two fewer 2X4's to the face would have been beneficial ) . The logic behind the traveling back in time and the mechanisms of the switches from one reality to the next is never very clearly explained , although given the scope of the swinging from present to past and back and forth again , had it been shown it would really have been a rather trivial issue . The jumps back in time are interesting in that Evan is literally able to jump into his younger self , speaking and acting as an adult though still a young boy , quickly and efficiently changing specific events and thus instantly altering the future ( although not eradicating from his own memory the alternate future that he just fixed , even though he fixed things so that they never even happened ? thus enters the paradoxes always involved with time travel ) . There are also things that don't make sense on a logical level in the movie . Here's a question , for example - if Evan knew about what was going to happen when the lady walks over to her mailbox with her baby , why did he run up and stand right in front of it when he went back to prevent their deaths ? You would think that he would have anticipated the blast , since he knew exactly when it was going to happen . I liked The Butterfly Effect a lot more than I thought I would , I had heard a lot of bad things about it . It's strange in that it starts off with a very interesting premise , then starts to get a little rough and border at times on being campy , but ultimately comes around full circle and I found myself more impressed than I anticipated when I saw the story come around and explain why it started the way it did and what the beginning scene meant . It's one of those films that starts right in the middle ( maybe because even the film doesn't understand Evan's mind ) , and then ultimately comes back to that point , gradually revealing the meaning of the film as a whole . Leave the kids and most of your desire to apply logic to the movies at home and it's thoroughly enjoyable .

Text2: They Live is one of those horror movies that is so scary and so good that it has become a comedy classic . Yes , comedy . There are maybe a total of five horror films that were made in the 80s that are or ever were even slightly frightening , the majority of them , particularly those which remain popular today , are popular because of their comedic value much more than their scariness . Now , I don't mean to badmouth 80s horror or to suggest that these movies are a sustained string of cinematic failures , but you really can't watch something like one of the Nightmares on Elm Street or a Friday the 13th film and afterwards say that you laughed less than you were scared . Okay , so maybe this is just me , but I really think that it can hardly be denied that the comedic content of horror films provide a large part of their overall appeal . And whether you personally agree with me or not , it's not hard to see that John Carpenter agrees . My favorite example of this in They Live is the way Nada ( the basically nameless main character ) reacts when he first begins to see what the alien beings really look like when he finds those glasses . Personally , I would have kept my visions a little more to myself until I figured out what was going on , but this guy hilariously tells an elderly woman exactly what he thinks of her appearance in the middle of a crowded convenience store . Now , I should probably point out that this is not really something that translates very well into film-review form , you just have to see it for yourself . By explaining it in writing here I feel like Mr . Burns trying to be funny ( ' We'll have some excellent practically-based jokes ! ' ) . And then , of course , there is the violence , which is so overdone that it's subsequent humor is nearly unrivaled until Quentin Tarantino came along and made Kill Bill . Nada is a construction worker who is struggling to maintain a job ( as are many of the other workers ) , but desperately needs to show his visions to someone else just to make sure he's not insane . He finds himself wanted by the police ( for reasons that I won't explain ) , and shows up at the construction site where he works to try to get one of his coworkers ( also struggling to maintain this job to make ends meet ) to try on the glasses . Personally , if I was in that guy's situation I wouldn't want to be getting involved with this apparent nutcase either , especially if I needed that job as badly as he obviously did . Nada is not about to let the guy go until he sees , though , and thus follows The Fight Scene , capitalized for obvious reasons . And by the way , if the guy didn't want to get involved with Nada , it seems like it would have been slightly less troublesome to just look through the glasses and walk away than to get into a full-on kickboxing match with him in broad daylight for half and hour or so . I watched the DVD version of They Live , and I have to say that I was a little disappointed that there was nothing on the DVD about how they did the makeup of the aliens , because I always thought that that was the most interesting part of the movie ( besides the fact that the whole control issue so closely resembled the operation of mass media and commercialism in real life ) . So what you have in They Live is a very interesting premise with a pretty simple delivery , but it works because it's cleverly done and believable , despite the fact that the whole magical sunglasses thing is more something that you might expect to see in a fiction story written by a kid in fourth grade . When I was in fourth grade I wrote a story about a hat that I could put on to make myself invisible , and the conceptual difference is really not that much . They Live is one of those 80s horror / comedy gems that is widely overlooked , especially today , when massive video chains like Blockbuster have reduced their horror sections to contain little more than the ridiculous crap that Hollywood cranks out and foolishly labels horror films , like Jeepers Creepers ( one of the dumbest horror films to come along since I Know What You Did Last Summer ) and other such nonsense . Granted , they still carry a few of the good ones - my local Blockbuster still has the original Nosferatu in its horror section , as well as some of the excellent recent horror films like The Ring and Ringu , upon which The Ring was based . And I DID rent They Live from my local Blockbuster , but it was in the DRAMA section . WOW . This is an example of the way that the horror genre has evolved and the way that older horror films have been affected . You would think that if they were going to completely redefine a genre , they would at least have put a movie like They Live in the COMEDY section .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
973,"Text1: This is one odious movie . The dialogues are terrible , the delivery is even worse , the cinematography is poor in the extreme and the film is about as original as any other serial killer flick from the eighties . You may be wondering why this film isn't rubbish , then ; and if you are , you're wondering up the wrong tree as rubbish is exactly what this is . That being said , its entertainment value lies in its crappiness , and although I can't justify saying this film is good ; there is some fun to be had . The main murder weapon is my personal favourite - the chainsaw ! However , it really isn't used very well as every murder basically features some guy revving a chainsaw , then we cut to a scene of some flesh being cut and then a little spurt of blood may follow afterwards . The fact that the film merely lumbers from one of these scenes to the next doesn't do it any favours either , as every scene inbetween killings is soaked in a sense of indifference . The plot follows a serial killer who decides to cut bits off women on a university campus in order to put together a human "" jigsaw "" . All we are offered in explanation for this behaviour is a scene at the start of the film that sees a little kid doing a naked woman jigsaw . . . Pieces has a serious problems where logic is concerned . First of all , we have a professional tennis player who is brought in undercover as a tennis trainer on campus by the police . I can only assume that they didn't have an officer as good as her . . . and I can also only assume that it didn't really matter if her cover gets blown as some kid from the school is told of the plan pretty soon after . The film also takes place in the town with the worst newspapers in the world . . . as it takes the press an eternity to get wind of the campus killer . And , just when you think the film can't get any more ridiculous - the police decide to bring one of the students in to help them with their investigation ! Their reason ; he can do their job better than they can . . . The film seems to take influence from the Giallo formula , probably in an attempt to cash in on the successful Italian imports , with the music score and black gloved killer . The mystery element in the film is pretty much nonexistent , and I really can't think of a good reason to recommend Pieces . The film fits into that ' really bad ' category of films along with the likes of Zombie Lake . . . so I guess the only reason to see this is if you don't mind watching absolute rubbish .

Text2: Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers , and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time . One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigo's and the Psycho's is this film ; Strangers on a Train , the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made . The story follows Guy Haines , a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senator's daughter , if he can get a divorce from his current wife . One day , on the way to see his wife , he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall ; and one that could ultimately cost him his life . The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinema's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time . What if two people "" swapped "" murders , thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime , and rendering their motive irrelevant ? Could this truly be the perfect murder ? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any , normal everyday person . Everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of , so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his ? The chances of it happening are unlikely , but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train ; and in this situation , anyone could . Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker ? The man was simply born for the part . He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in . The character of Bruno is a madman , but he's not a lunatic ; he's a calculating , conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable . His performance is extremely malevolent , and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality . Unfortunately , Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train , and I believe that is a great loss to cinema . Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does , but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger . Granger never really impresses that much , but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker . Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person ; and that is how it should be . Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be . She isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression , but she makes the best of what she has . Alfred Hitchcock's daughter , Patricia , takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara , the sister of Guy's fiancé . She is suitably lovely in this role , and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in . Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime , and it is very much so in this film . There is one shot in particular , that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses . This is an absolutely brilliant shot , and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene . Hitchcock's direction is moody throughout , and very much complies with the film noir style . The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting , and I don't think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film . It's truly overblown , and out of turn from the rest of the movie ; but it works . There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time , and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story , but he also uses to camera to do so as well . Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made . Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking , and is sure to delight any fan of cinema . A masterpiece .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

978,"Text1: This is an interesting change of pace comedy for Jean Harlow . She is not playing a lower class shop girl or even a prostitute like in THE GIRL FROM MISSOURI or RED DUST , nor a slumming upper class girl ( as in THE PUBLIC ENEMY ) . Instead she is playing a very popular film star with a very sexy body and screen personae - gee , it sounds like she is playing Jean Harlow . According to the thread the character she is playing ( "" Lola Burns "" ) was supposed to be based on Clara Bow ( certainly the two names are similar in sound ) . But it could be based on Harlow's attempts ( tragically repeatedly doomed ) to have a happy normal life but finding her screen personae interfering . Still , even if one starts thinking of Harlow's marriage to Paul Bern or her romance with William Powell , the film is engrossing and humorous enough to make you push aside the tragedy of the life of Harlean Carpenter . Lola is , like all movie stars , a prisoner of the studio's determination to get all the public attention publicity can garner from it's merchandise ( it's stars ) . In particular Lola finds herself at the mercy of the studio's head publicity man "" Space Hanlon "" ( Lee Tracy ) . Tracy is always coming up with goofy stunts , or twisting events that involve Lola in her attempts at normality ( like adopting a baby , or dating a "" normal "" man ( Franchot Tone ) into another mess . The studio only cares that she personifies sexual allure - so Hanlon keeps making that the key to his publicity : he even arranges a fight between several men on the set of her latest film ( one is director Pat O'Brien ) supposedly over Lola's love . Lola is not against sex and love - the quote in the "" Summary line "" is Lola's when her maid wakes her at the start of the film , and she's just had a promising sex dream . She really needs a confidante - but everyone around her takes advantage of her . Her father ( Frank Morgan ) is an alcoholic , cadging old scoundrel ( who keeps reminding her - to her growing disgust - of her owing him obedience as her loving father ) . Her sibling ( Ted Healey ) is also an alcoholic , constantly having sexual affairs that she has to get him out of . Her maid actually steals from the household accounts ( Lola is aware of this - she is not stupid ) . And all constantly are as demanding on her as her studio . Ironically there is one person who would be her confidante and more - but he knows she'll reject him . It's Space , who loves her . In fact , some of the stunts he sets up is to get rid of possible rivals . Eventually , can he get her to recognize this ? Ah that is the final point of the film . Harlow was a gifted comic actress , knowing how to use her image for fun ( such as Wallace Beery's unfaithful wife in DINNER AT EIGHT ) . But I suspect because of her own problems in Hollywood and real life she put more of herself in this film than in any other . I can't say it was her best performance ( I tend to like RED DUST and CHINA SEAS a little more ) but it was somehow her most real performance , and the film benefits as a result .

Text2: Remember - before there was Sidney , there was Dudley . Dudley Digges is barely recalled today - because his heyday as a fixture in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s . Except for one major performance : the ship's good natured , if tipsy doctor in the 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY , most of his films are barely revived . More's the pity because he was a wonderful actor . In 1931 he played Casper Gutman ( the original actor to play that villain ) opposite Ricardo Cortez's Sam Spade in the first THE MALTESE FALCON . Similarly , about the same time , he played the recording angel in Leslie Howard's version of OUTWARD BOUND - the same role that Sidney Greenstreet tackled in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS a decade later . Digges could be likable and lovable ( that ship's doctor again ) , or detestable ( in CHINA SEAS , as the judgmental First Mate sneering at poor Lewis Stone but then proving he's as big a coward in a moment of crisis ) . He held his own against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES . He is the Chinese freedom fighter working with Gary Cooper in THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN . Digges could do anything . Here , he is Mr . Thompson , the hypocritical and thieving warden of a reform school that Frankie Darro and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and injuring a Greek-American store owner ( it is the latest incident for most of them ) . Digges is as bad here as in CHINA SEAS , but it is a close thing to totally dislike him . He's able to somehow transcend his roles . . . more later about that . Darro has a gang of urban delinquents ( including a Jewish boy and "" Farina "" from "" OUR GANG "" ) . As pointed out in another review , it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys . We see them shake down car owners to pay them to "" watch and protect "" their autos . When one guy won't do it , they calmly wreck his car . The snatch and grab robbery at the store of the Greek-American is also rather graphically shown - his skull getting fractured when pushed . The boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge Arthur Byron , who realizes that he can't leave the kids with their parents : the parents are unable to watch them , or are incompetent . Unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence : a Jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son , Farina's stereotype "" Yassum "" father , and the an Italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out of going to the reform school . Once there the boys find the regime oppressive . Occasionally one of the guards or the nurse ( Madge Evans ) tries to speak up for them . But Digges has no time for coddling . His is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves . Unfortunately , Digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy . They have been serving inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit . One day a new official comes from the state to look at the reform school . It's Jimmy Cagney , who is a hack ward heeler whose gang got the vote out for Edward Maxwell . As a reward ( he could not get the Park Commissioner post ) Cagney was made an Assistant school inspector . He is supported by his hanger-on pal and factotum Allan Jenkins ( in his first Warner Brother film ) . The irony is that if Digges were a bit more careful , Cagney would probably have let him continue running things . But Cagney arrives to see Darro brought to Digges for fighting . The Warden and Darrow have had problems about respect earlier , and Digges now intends to punish Darro who flees - but get seriously injured by Digges ' barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip . Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans treat Darro's injuries . And she explains the reality of the situation to Cagney , and her own idea of real reformatory reform of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility . The film follows this to the end , showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right path , turning the reformatory as a "" republic "" for the boys to run properly . This leads to conflict with Digges , whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies . But the scheme is derailed when Cagney himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law . Digges sees his opportunity and fully takes it . But then he goes too far . . . far more than he ever bargained for . The 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right wrongs and change things . Darro appeared in such as WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD . Cecil B . De Mille did THIS DAY AND AGE , where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by Charles Bickford that scares the hell out of him . So it went in the 1930s . THE MAYOR OF HELL reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking . But that's the one problem of the film . Digges ' character is a knave and hypocrite , so we never really cheer for him , yet if he wasn't a thief we might go along with his view ( even if it is counter-productive ) . The scenes at the start of Darro and his gang preying on people actually make the harshness Digges would follow seem fairly understandable ( even if his thieving ways are not ) . Also he has one moment when he's justifiably angry at Cagney - at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law - giving orders over a phone from long distance to a befuddled Digges . When Digges learns what's actually happened he is justifiably furious at Cagney lecturing him about proper behavior . It is the closest thing to making Mr . Thompson sympathetic in this fine movie .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

At any rate , I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep . It doesn't matter , because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes . That being said , I think that one of the things that really makes Alien great is that it explains all the twists and turns of its plot in great detail , which is almost unheard of in science fiction and horror films . No one displays ludicrous behavior to allow for the construction of bloody , gory death scenes , the alien , masterfully designed , isn't rushing across the screen in every scene to allow for maximum payoff of the costume design , we don't even see it until well past the halfway point in the movie . Like Jaws , Alien takes its time to allow the characters to gradually grasp the enormity of their situation . The Nostromo is a merchant ship , which allows for a non-military crew to be faced with a mortal enemy that they do not understand . The ship intercepts a strange transmission that must be from an intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds , and so it wakes up the crew to investigate . The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important . The transmission didn't just appear , the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule , because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen . And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financial-minded crew members , it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence . The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect . When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated , they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship , complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair . A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside , creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to . One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs , gets attacked , and is brought back on board the ship . Significantly , protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention . When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite , a new and particularly difficult challenge arises . How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed ? And to make matters worse , the very ship is programmed to work against them . They are in the most hostile environment imaginable , worse than anywhere on earth . They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship , and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival . They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on . Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy . Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been ( and possibly ever will be ) thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel , Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for , the darker , more sinister and dangerous side . The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes . In fact , by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now , you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years . Back then , this was horror / science fiction . Today , it's science fiction / horror . But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today , it is significant that , while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror , the movie has lost none of its powerful effect . Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it , it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Robert Culp's character kills somebody who wants to destroy his professional reputation as a top scientist who helps improves sales in grocery stores and other ways . Anyway , you have to watch how Columbo catches him . Like a typical episode , he becomes interested in his line of work but does not forget the victim or the crime .

Text2: Okay , the premise is about a tough-talking , smart female U . S . Marshall agent Mary Shannon played by the wonderful Mary McCormack . She works in a predominantly male world but she acts more like one of the guys than one of the girls . Lesley Ann Warren plays her mother , Jinx , with two dogs . McCormack is truly a professional and team player and the role is suited to her real-life personality . She did not get this far without being tough in this business . I didn't think I would like this show but I did to some extent . The show is set in Albuquerque , New Mexico which is change from Los Angeles where they do film on location . It's a decent show but it's not that great . It's not because of McCormack's character but it's because it's so similar to everything else on television today . Anyway , she plays a tough and rough attractive U . S . Marshall who handles witness protection witnesses who usually don't follow rules in the first place . She is not allowed to discuss her work with her family who thinks she runs errands . She has a drug-addicted sister and a mother who spends more time with her dogs than with her kids . In a way , Mary has raised herself and her family . She also has a lover , Raphael , on the side but she claims it's only sexual . Her partner and her have more chemistry to me . The show is filmed in New Mexico which it gives a more authentic nature . I think the chemistry between Mary Shannon and her partner , Marshall Mann , played equally well by Fred Weller is quite apparent . Despite coming across as rough and tough , Mary Shannon has a softer , vulnerable side that does come across . But in a man's world or business , you have to be more of a man than a woman . The job of U . S . Marshall is not easy and in fact it's difficult to find out information because they are sworn to secrecy until death so she couldn't get the information regarding the profession that she portraying on screen . While I think the show has some originality with the U . S . Marshalls premise , the show needs to work on character development . Why is Jinx single ? Was she widowed or divorced ? How come Mary Shannon seems to be more of the dominant character in the household ? Given time and possible another season , it can develop into a well-meaning thought provoking show . Mary McCormack can prove that a woman can still be feminine and be masculine simultaneously . I kind of enjoy how she is aggressive with some of the men in custody . It's kind of fun of watching a man get his but kicked by a tough-talking and acting woman .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: It's not just Hollywood that is interested in making a fast buck , even the British aren't immune . FIRST MAN INTO SPACE is a rather cynical excersise in remaking a superior story , namely THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT , while pretending that it's an American film by casting a couple of American actors while cutting to a sign saying "" Welcome To The American State Of . . . "" at every opportunity . So ignore the tagline of "" The first motion picture to lift the veil of the first man in history to be rocketed into the terrifying unknown of outer space "" because Nigel Kneale captured this concept several years earlier . It should also be pointed out that New Mexico where much of the story is set has a lack of vast forests as seen here The real problem however is that there's a serious lack of internal logic . By this I mean you'll be entirely puzzled as to the monster's motive for killing people . For example a couple of highway cops see a car driving erratically , so they stop the car and find a dead female driver and a man mutated into a monster who then kills the cops . Ask yourself this : How would a crazed bloodthirsty monster be able to drive a car ? Perhaps more importantly why would a driver stop to pick up a crazed blood thirsty monster in the first place ? It also becomes more puzzling that this monster is able to articulate its motives when the script demands it at the end of the film . None of this makes much sense Of course this is a problem with a great number of horror films where in order to follow horror convention so that someone gets killed every 15 minutes people do things that are totally unrealistic and you could argue that if someone is pointing out these faults then they're taking this film far too seriously . Maybe . But there are also some horror films that compelling and thought provoking and FIRST MAN INTO SPACE isn't one of them","{""output"": ""YES""}"
985,"Text1: Let us say this - the film is an eye-filler . Cinemascope was just starting and the use of the city of Rome as a backdrop was an excellent one . One only wishes a more charming and better film ( such as ROMAN HOLIDAY ) had been the first to use it , but that film was shot in black and white , and not in a big screen format like cinema-scope . Yet that film holds up better . There is an unwritten rule regarding screenplays - keep them relatively simple or the story is stretched beyond acceptable belief . As this is a romantic film we are willing to let it stretch a little , but certain points about it that were acceptable in 1954 are now seen as hard to believe . The plot deals with three women who are Americans and find themselves working in Rome . Two are connected to the American Embassy there , represented by Howard St . John . St . John was a capable , if unexciting , actor . He was the original General Bullmoose in the musical "" L'il Abner "" ( and like Peter Palmer repeated his performance in the film version ) . He was usually playing professional men ( lawyers , bankers , diplomats ) many of whom if not crooked were willing to accept a degree of accommodation with unlikeable types for some advantage ( in the film of Woody Allen's play DON'T DRINK THE WATER , St . John is willing to allow an innocent American family get smeared by a Communist Regime as spies so he could make headlines about negotiating their release for an upcoming political campaign ) . He is also recalled as Broderick Crawford's legal adviser in BORN YESTERDAY . St . John fit in well ( including his homburg hats ) with the style of the Eisenhower years . Here St . John is observing the behavior of two of the woman , Maggie MacNamara and Jean Peters , making sure they toe the line regarding no fraternizing with Italians . But the three woman ( the third is Dorothy Maguire ) are walking by the Trevi Fountain in Rome , and when discussing the legend that you can get your wish there they throw their coins into the fountain ( hence the title of the film ) wishing for staying on in Rome or for romance . MacNamara meets a local Prince played by Louis Jordan , and Peters meets a young man working at the Embassy ( Rosanno Brazzi ) and two romances start up . St . John is not thrilled at this , and ends ( or tries to end ) the one between Peters and Brazzi by firing Brazzi . He can't do much with MacNamara and Jordan , as the latter is not attached to the Embassy , and is pretty important in Italy itself . Maguire has been already living in Rome for 15 years . Originally working at the embassy , she has become the secretary of a famous novelist played by Clifton Webb . Although she occasionally goes out with St . John , she is frequently in the company of Webb as well . We subsequently learn that she has been carrying the torch for Webb all these years , but he is unaware of it . Now it as been pointed out by other writers on this website that Webb , talented performer that he was in film , was the closest thing that the movies could produce as a closet "" Gay "" man in the movies of the 1940s and 1950s . Intellectual , sharp tongued , frequently cruel ( in his serious roles like Waldo Lydecker or Eliot Templeton ) he was amusing ( Mr . Belvedere or MR . SCOUTMASTER or DREAMBOAT ) and always attention getting . But the thought that he could have any woman quietly carrying a torch for him for 15 years is a stretch - I say this even after seeing him as Frank Gilbreth in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN , as the ultimate father and husband - aided by Myrna Loy in that role . Yet we find him in such a position here , and playing it as though it all makes sense . He even has a chance to show that he can be noble to Maguire when he learns of an unfortunate turn of events . The other two romances rise and collapse due to economic pressures ( Peters and Brazzi ) and character failure ( MacNamara and Jordan ) . How does the film end . I will only add that the script writers decided to turn Webb into a noble lover and a deus ex machina at the conclusion . I take it that this was fine in 1954 , the year this film was made and the year of my birth . Ike was President only one year , and we had a confidence in our nation having a fairly flawless future if we only listened to the wisdom of the wise and old . And Webb just fit the bill for that in this romantic film . The performances are pretty good , including MacNamara - who a year before had gotten critically good notices ( and even an Oscar nomination ) in the now dated and abysmal THE MOON IS BLUE . Here her stridency in that role is tone down , and she actually is acceptable in her pursuit of Jordan . Jordan is good as a man who believes in trust as the cornerstone of love . Peters is a practical girl who nearly loses Brazzi due to his relative poverty . And Maguire makes the most of her improbable role , especially in a late drunk scene sequence . For the performances and the cinematography it is a "" 7 "" . But the story would need real repair work if the film was redone today .

Text2: Carol Baker and James Shigata are good highly capable performers , but they tended to peak early in the 1950s and 1960s . However , they both did very well in telling this true story about Gwen , an American from Tennessee , met , fell in love with , and married "" Teri "" a Japanese diplomat in Washington , and how the events of 1935 to 1945 made their lives together extremely difficult if not dangerous . For the events leading to the Great Pacific War between Japan and the U . S . made Gwen's insistence on staying with Teri and their daughter Mako ( two young girls play Mako as she grows to be nine years old ) lead to one problem after another . This film was produced in 1961 , and it was made just at the moment when American audiences began being willing to make some extended effort at burying the hatchet with Japan . In the 1950s , thanks to Douglas MacArthur's work as our "" proconsul "" rebuilding Japan , the country retained it's imperial family ( even Hirohito ) and yet became a fairly reliable ally and democracy . It helped that in this period China ( formerly the tragic victim of Japanese militarism ) was now ( except for Formosa ) a bastion of Communism . The films of this period did show negatives in part ( Sessue Hayakawa's Col . Saito in "" The Bridge On The River Kwai "" at first ) , but also showed the pressures on our old enemies . Hayakawa's Saito loses face to his prisoner Nicholson who is better organized in engineering the bridge than the Japanese Colonel is . Other films dealt with re-understanding Japan . There was "" Sayonara "" , where Marlon Brando , Red Buttons , and Myoshi Umeki try to sexually bridge the divide of East and West , with tragic results . There was the kids travelogue - adventure film "" Escapade In Japan "" , wherein American and Japanese kids pal around the country . There was also the film "" A Majority Of One "" , wherein middle aged Roselind Russell and Japanese industrialist Alec Guiness find a romance despite her children's opposition . Also despite some past history ( her son died at Pearl Harbor , his wife and children at Hiroshima ) . There was also the French film "" Hiroshima Mon Amour "" which was about an inter-racial love affair , but looked at the long range effects of the radiation in the bombed city . It was a good moment to reevaluate the past . The period probably lasted until 1970 when "" Tora , Tora , Tora "" properly and somberly presented the story of the attack of December 1941 from both sides . To me "" Bridge To The Sun "" is a natural follow-up of Jimmy Cagney's "" Blood On The Sun "" . Although the Japanese were mostly villains and sneaks in Cagney's film ( especially the politician Baron Tanaka - John Emory ) Cagney was willing to show there were good Japanese , in particular an elderly Japanese aristocrat seeking to prevent the success of the militarists ( and who is murdered by them ) . That happened to be true regarding the politics of Japan in the 1930s . Several leading politicians who seemed too peaceful or not patriotic were killed off by assassins ( most of whom got slap on the wrist punishments ) . Shigata's Teri happens to be of the peace party , and as the film continues one sees he is fighting an impossibly well organized foe . The best moment that shows this is in a portion of the film dealing with November - December 1941 . Shigata tries to get a missionary friend to speak to FDR to send a personal message to the Emperor to keep Japan and the U . S . at peace . Instead , we see that despite all attempts to be careful , Shigata and his fellow peace lovers are being observed by the militarists . The story of the mixed marriage is fascinating because both Americans and Japanese stigmatize the couple . While going to the train with Mako to be reunited with Teri , Gwen sees American racism and hatred at it's worse ( "" how dare she marry one of those people ! "" ) . Similarly Teri is bothered in Japan by military bullyboys , and Mako is crying when she is teased and hit by Japanese children and even her teacher . Yet by the time the film ends , Mako has become so identified with her father's people she hates the Americans as invaders . "" Bridge To The Sun "" may be the best Hollywood film to show the home front in Japan in the war . It is disheartening . While America and Britain went into rationing in the war , they never went as far as Japan did where a little rice was given to the Japanese people for most of their stamps . Actually even Germany was being less hard for awhile . According to Albert Speer , luxury items were being produced in Hitler's Reich up to late 1944 . Not Japan - every available crumb went into the military's stomachs . The film follows Teri's continued attempts to rebuild the peace party , which only gets him into serious trouble with his oldest friend Hara ( James Yagi , who gives a good performance of a committed militarist who won't let old friendships keep him from his work ) . But Teri won't give up , despite Hara and the Kamentai . And Gwen remains loyal to her husband , up to the film's end . . . which is quite unexpectedly poignant .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

987,"Text1: I recall that for many years this was the only one of Harold Lloyd's movies that occasionally turned up on screen in New York City . It is a passably funny film about an archaeologist who falls for the daughter of a tycoon and finds himself fighting the forces of Wall Street and fate itself to get the young lady . Lloyd's character is trying to fight an apparent curse from the tomb that he opened . The film literally goes to it's conclusion before the viewers learn if the curse will or will not work . Lloyd is ably supported in the film by Raymond Walburn , William Frawley , Lionel Stander , and Thurston Hall . Phyllis Welch was the young woman Lloyd pursues . She did nicely in the role , but not spectacularly . Her career soon faded from sight . Of the sound films made by Lloyd , "" Professor Beware "" usually is near the bottom . It is better ( in my opinion ) than "" Welcome Danger "" or "" Feet First "" , but it falls below the other four sound films . The problem with it is that it lacks any relationship to the type of film identified with Lloyd at his peak . It's situation comedy plot could have been done by most other comedians or leading men of the day . But it is not a total failure , and is worth watching .

Text2: I mentioned when reviewing THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP that David Low played no favorites with his cartoons . In the 1930s he attacked all the great dictators ( Hitler , Mussolini , Franco , and Stalin ) . He also found his reactionary Colonel useful to attack any other types of reactionaries . In 1941 , after Churchill declared he would send aid to Communist Russian against their common enemy Germany , Russian hard liners screamed about trusting Imperial Britain . Low made a cartoon on this , with a Russian hardliner who was the Colonel , but now called "" Blimpski "" . Still the Anglo-Communist alliance was a difficult one to totally accept , even when one realized it's total necessity against Nazi barbarism . THE DEMI-PARADISE illustrates this problem . Laurence Olivier is a committed Communist Russian engineer , trying to perfect a torpedo for his nation's war effort . Stalin's government arranges to send Olivier to England to work with English naval experts to make his new form of gyroscope work . The problem is that Olivier is totally suspicious of his hosts . He is a man in his early 30s , and he has been brought up to suspect that Britain ( like Germany and Italy ) is against the Soviet Union . After all , it was against the Soviet Union for decades . So the film follows as Olivier gets use to the vagaries of the British character he meets with in different English men and women . Gradually he learns to trust them but it takes quite a while . The film has it's problems . Olivier prided himself on his abilities with accents , but in truth ( seeing his movie and television performances today ) when he plays English or American people he sounds realistic . When he tries foreign accents one cringes . He copies Albert Basserman ( including shrugs ) when he does Germans ( or German Jews ) . His Russian engineer , at first , sounds realistic - but he also sounds slow witted . To be fair with Olivier his engineer is speaking a second language ( but no Russian is heard in the film ) . He speaks definitively and slowly - and it gets to be a drag . A real Russian would have a faster clip to his words ( unless , as I said , he was slow witted ) . The best parts are the various British character actors , teaching the Russian visitor about the traditions and their importance to Britains . Olivier does point out some of them are silly ( which occasionally the others agree ) . For example , there is a yearly "" historic "" pageant in the town , and Margaret Rutherford runs it . One of the highlights is a reenactment of the moment in late June 1815 when a coach arrived in the town announcing the battle of Waterloo . A bemused Felix Aylmer ( the head of the local ship yard , and a host for Olivier ) looks at this moment which he has seen for umpteen times before , and says out loud , "" I wonder who won ! "" The film , as a morale booster , was good . As a reminder of a critical wartime problem ( that fortunately was overcome long enough to defeat the Nazis ) it is rather special .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Against the advice and wishes of his girlfriend Maya ( Leslie Bibb ) , Leon begins stalking a notorious serial killer named Mahogany ( Vinnie Jones ) , who is a legend of sorts that totally beats the living hell out of after midnight subway riders . The finale is as interesting as making a playground in the middle of a slaughter house . THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN is intended for mature viewers that can handle the perverse and graphic carnage .

989,"Text1: Rock drummer Roberto Tobias ( a solid portrayal by Michael Brandon ) is stalked by a guy ( sinister Calisto Calisti ) who plans on blackmailing him . After accidentally killing the man , Roberto finds himself being tormented and terrorized by a crazed maniac who witnessed the murder . Said maniac begins bumping off folks who are close to Roberto . Writer / director Dario Argento brings his trademark fluid and hypnotic style to this engrossing giallo murder mystery thriller while maintaining a steady pace and tense atmosphere throughout . Of course , Argento stages the murder set pieces with his usual twisted gusto , with a climactic juicy decapitation rating as the definite grisly highlight . Moreover , Argento brings a welcome and amusing sense of offbeat humor to the picture : there's a striking perspective shot from inside a guitar , one person keeps receiving unwanted Swedish pornography in the mail , and Roberto beats up a hapless mailman he mistakes for the maniac . Mimsy Farmer delivers a strong performance as Roberto's frosty wife Nina ; her intense and forceful pull out all the stops acting at the film's conclusion is especially impressive . Brandon as Roberto makes for a decidedly flawed and less than sympathetic protagonist . Popping up in colorful supporting parts are the ever-amusing Bud Spencer as Roberto's grumpy friend Godfrey ( who Roberto refers to as "" God "" ) , Jean-Pierre Marielle as jolly openly gay private investigator Gianni Arrosio , and Oreste Lionello as flaky oddball the Professor . The killer's true identity is genuinely startling - - and strangely poignant . Franco Di Giacomo's sumptuous widescreen cinematography boasts a lot of wild camera angles while Ennio Morricone supplies a nicely spooky'n'shivery score . Well worth seeing for Argento fans .

Text2: While I am a firm believer that there will NEVER be a version of Frankentein that is as good as the book , this is at least a step in the right direction . While I would rate the Karloff version higher simply because of its technical merits and ability to scare you , this made for TV version is superior in many ways . Unlike earlier versions , this one really centers on the creature and its unfortunate existence . Like the book , the focus is on the "" monster "" after it is soon abandoned by its maker and the life the creature creates for itself shows great humanity and depth . In fact , in this way , the movie is terribly sad and heart-wrenching . Let me give a couple of examples . First , soon after the creature is created , Frankenstein's assistant plays with him . The monster , unaware of his immense strength , crushes the poor assistant to death . When Frankenstein returns to find this , the creature is saying "" Otto , play "" over and over again because he has no idea what he's done . Second , after running away , the creature hides out in a pantry - - living among the bags of potatoes . He is so lonely for human contact that he delights in listening to the family talk and interact - - knowing he cannot reveal his ugly self to them . In fact , he is so miserable , that he creates a little pretend man out of a potato and talks to it out of desperation . How pathetic ! This film chooses to focus on the creature and portray him like a toddler sent out to live alone . On this level it is very successful .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

This lasts about five seconds , to be followed by another shot of three horse-drawn wagons on a dirt road with some mountains in the far background . One grows tired of looking at these various Edison pieces which claim to be of specific locations , but might well be lies . Certainly most of the Spanish-American battle scenes are shot in one particular field in New Jersey - - the same field that was later used for the Boer War . You can recognize that field after seeing it in Cuba , the Philippines and the Transvaal . That field is a globe-trotting star . One begins to appreciate the setting shots used in longer movies - - the Transamerica Pyramid indicating that you're in San Francisco , the Eiffel Tower to let you know you're in Paris . It's a little more identifiable than a couple of mountains and a dirt road .

Even worse than those is the watering down of Woody's manic personality in the decade since Seamus Culhane was in charge of his best shorts .

991,"Text1: It seems to me that you'll either love or hate this offering , judging by the comments of other reviewers for the film . As a fan of the genre , I'll always give the benefit of the doubt to the plus side , I rather got a kick out of "" The Mad Monster "" , with George Zucco as a deranged scientist , given to phantom meetings with his former colleagues who drummed him out of academia for his outlandish experiments and theories . After all , if you're looking to ingratiate yourself with the War Department , you might want to check the dictionary for a suitable replacement for an "" army of wolf men "" . But it's exactly this kind of weirdness that makes the film fun , especially when Dr . Lorenzo Cameron ( Zucco ) injects his gardener assistant Petro ( Glenn Strange ) with a serum of wolf blood to transform him into a revenge machine . With cunning precision , Cameron launches his creation on a scientist killing spree , taking out his detractors one by one while maintaining a self assured calm , not to mention a perfect alibi for his whereabouts each time . A half dozen years following his wolf man portrayal , Strange would take on the role of the feature creature in 1948's "" Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein "" . What gives the movie it's most endearing charm however are the neat fog shrouded swamp scenes replete with hanging moss ; for a poverty row effort I don't think I've ever seen it done better . It's the perfect touch for midnight viewings on a dark and stormy night . Let's give some credit to the supporting cast , Anne Nagel as Lenora Cameron , the mad doctor's pretty daughter , who has a bit of a thing for newspaper reporter Tom Gregory ( Johnny Downs ) , hot on the trail of the "" beast on two legs "" story . Downs is actually top billed over Zucco and Glenn Strange in this effort , though that's highly questionable . One look at Doctor Cameron , and one take of his diabolical laugh is all that's needed to know that it's George Zucco's show all the way . Just turn down the lights for maximum atmosphere , and in Petro's own words , you "" ain't got no reason to be afraid "" .

Text2: I've watched about fifty John Wayne movies to date , and I have to say that this one has always been my favorite . I think it has to do with the fact that in this , his last picture , he did such an excellent job of portraying a character who wasn't John Wayne . Here he was , a dying man who had to be convinced of that fact , but once understood , decided that he would do it on his own terms and at a time of his own choosing . In that regard , he received inspiration from old Doc Hostetler ( Jimmy Stewart ) , who upon diagnosing the cancer that would eventually lay him low , challenges J . B . Books ( Wayne ) with this insight - "" I would not die a death like I just described , ? not if I had your courage "" . It's intriguing to watch Wayne's character develop from a former lawman and gunfighter into a human being , as evidenced by a couple of interesting scenes . Consider how upon meeting Gillom Rogers ( Ron Howard ) he reverts to his gruff frontier mannerism of bossing him around to take care of his horse and run some chores . Gillom manages to put him in his place , but Books takes it in stride with a profound sense that the young whippersnapper might actually be deserving of some respect . I also got a kick out of the scene when Books made Moses ( Scatman Crothers ) the best haggler , a keen way to win a friend and ally . That was just a great piece of character development that managed to take the edge off a gunman who was willing to leave his notoriety behind him . If you remember Ron Howard as far back as his ' Andy Griffith ' days , there's no mistaking that Opie Taylor look in his eyes when his mother ( Lauren Bacall ) first tells him that Books is dying . It's not something a casual viewer of Howard's films would pick up on , but it's definitely there . There was for that single moment , a childlike naiveté that surfaced that resisted acknowledging the fact that something like illness could bring down a once legendary gunfighter . The relationship that builds from there between Gillom and Books gives rise to the astonishing climax that pushes Gillom to the brink of his own humanity . With no wars to win or country to save , it's a treat to watch John Wayne interact with veteran contemporary Jimmy Stewart , and play off of Bacall's Bond Rogers in a hint of a romance that engenders mutual respect . It's also cool to see Richard Boone and Hugh O'Brian , both remembered for their strong portrayals of classic TV Western heroes , on the other side of the fence as villains of the picture . Along with Harry Morgan as the conflicted city marshal Thibido , "" The Shootist "" is a fitting ride into the sunset for these legendary actors , and a worthy send off for one of the all time great screen cowboys who spanned the decades from ' B ' shoot ' em ups to genuine ' A ' list Westerns .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
992,"Text1: M . Night Shyamalan , sad to say , was a case of a fluke in Hollywood . This isn't to say that he hasn't had some good moments in movies like Unbreakable and Signs ( more-so for the former ) , but The Sixth Sense , one of the great big wonderkind stories of the 90s has manifested itself with its creator churning out pieces of , frankly , crap upon its unwitting audience . This isn't to say that because his first few hits he wont make more movies - matter of fact he's apparently working on an Avatar picture ( not the James Cameron one , the kid-anime one ) - but following the Village , which took the ludicrous ' twist ' ending to new horrific heights , and Lady in the Water which is , at least to me , a true unmitigated disaster unleashed on to celluloid , The Happening continues the thread of total nonsense in the guise of thoughtful blockbuster stuff . Point of order : The Happening's title first opens up the potential pit-falls for jokes on the title alone ( does anyone else not picture a 60s flower-power flick ? ) , and indeed "" something's happening "" or "" it's happened "" or some variation is said enough times to merit a drinking game after it . But then the actual movie , from its opening scenes all the way to the last , are so ridiculous in nearly every step of the way for the same basic reasons that Edward D . Wood Jr's movies are still totally ridiculous failures : give actors a screenplay that is loaded with laughably hackneyed dialog ( at one point the Zooey Deschanal character says , and I quote , "" Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that can be invented "" ) , delivered by more or less ( usually less ) competent actors with straight faces as they are put into a stupid sci-fi premise . In this case a mighty wind of sorts , or rather some chemical coming from the plants that are angry or incensed via nature's wrath or whatever the hell , is attacking the cities and towns of the northeast and the Moore family ( Walhberg and Deschanal and daughter ) run from it . Yep , that's right , a lot of the movie is just characters running from the wind - with the occasional pit stop for Wahlberg to talk to a plastic plant - and from scene to scene there is just one incredibly laughable inanity after another . To give some very minor credit where it's due , it's not always the fault of the direction ; as was the case in the Village there are one or two moments that do reveal some sort of ' vision ' in the works , a shot or two that stand out as impressive . . . and then we get put back into the "" what-the-bleep "" clockwork of this overwrought "" message "" movie that says , apparently , that what we don't know from nature and probably can't know since we can't really trust science will kill us . And all the while Shyamalan almost creates something inadvertently very entertaining ; I can imagine the Happening becoming one of those classic bad movies years from now , so entirely dumbfounding with its totally serious-toned acting , dead-pan dialog and awfully staged violence ( i . e . lion feeding , lawnmower ) that one can't help but find it riotous . Maybe Shyamalan can continue his career that way , who knows ? One thing is for certain : the guy is NOT the next Hitchcock or the next Spielberg . He's lucky the wind hasn't knocked him off his feet completely .

Text2: It's one of the big "" fiasco "" stories of Hollywood lore : the most gargantuan budget spent on a single motion picture - 47 million ( the equivalent of about 260 million today ) - on an epic so huge in scale that it was nearly unthinkable , however true , that it started out as a modestly budgeted production that skyrocketed by a myriad of reasons . Not least of which was star Elizabeth Taylor herself , who first stopped the first try at production with Rouben Mamoulian through her various real / fake illnesses , then second through her notorious relationship with Richard Burton that started on the set and distracted them from certain scenes ( which is arguable but the point is valid ) . By the time the film was released it could in only a miracle recoup its budget in its initial theatrical run , and got ( to say it nicely ) mixed reviews . To see Cleopatra now isn't to say that history has been entirely kind to the production , but it should be said that it can be viewed somewhat on the terms that Joseph L . Mankiewicz set out for the final product . All the money is up there on the screen , in nearly disgusting detail and extravagance , yet the director has also crafted something that does , usually , have substance past the enormous spectacle and ( also to say softly ) lavish production designs and sets . He tells the story of Cleopatra , Egypt's most ( in ) famous queen , in a split-act form that is like two movies strung together ( in fact it was the director's idea to have them as separate 3-hour epics , though eventually each part was trimmed by an hour and put together again ) , and while the latter part might work better than the former , it's an impressive , flawed , and interesting effort all the same . It might be much to go into too much detail about all of the specifics of the story , as it would take up far too much of this review . Suffice to say it's first about Cleopatra ( Taylor ) and her mentor - cum - father - to - her - child Caesar ( Rex Harrison , in surprisingly good two-dimensional form ) , and then after he is killed her hot and complex relationship with Marc Antony ( Burton ) , and the eventual war between Rome and Egypt via the new power-hungry Caesar ( stunning Roddy McDowell ) . For this first part , which is mostly with Harrison and Taylor and a little Burton thrown in , it's a lot of exposition that sometimes is quite dull ; one wonders when the big spectacle will come about , the exception of course that spectacular "" entrance "" of Cleopatra's into Rome . Yet , it's never really too dis-interesting , if only from a ( Hollywoodized ) historical point of view , and if one is a buff of Roman history - or , at least , Roman epics - there should be enough to hold the interest . It's when Cleopatra and Marc Antony get the most screen time in the second half , however , that things start to get a lot more absorbing ; the chemistry in real life rubbed off on the two stars , and there are scenes where Burton ( probably the most highly charged of the major actors ) and Taylor square off like it's oneupmanship . And as Mankiewicz goes further with the story into the final battle , things pick up in the narrative that suddenly gets things boiling like a good old-fashioned epic , and there's finally a synergy of substance and style that is spotty for some portions of the film . Yes , it's probably TOO big , and TOO long , and with the hubris of the producers and its stars right up there in certain moments if not spread throughout ( it goes without saying that Taylor's diva demands seem to radiate off her queen in some real specific instances ) . But it's no failure by any means , and it's no disaster either . At the same time it also shoots short of greatness by not being , apparently , very well organized , with no complete script and its director re-writing scenes ala Godard the night before it was too be filmed . For what it's worth , some 45 years later , it's a fine achievement that isn't overrated and maybe just a tinge underrated .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

McGinley , Clea Duvall , Rebecca DeMornay , Amanda Peet , Jake Busey ) come together in a rundown desert motel during a rainstorm , suspicions and fear among them rise when it appears their is a killer in their midst . Adding the intrigue are the seemingly unconnected scenes of a late-night hearing of a would-be sent-to-death serial taking place far , far away from the motel . For about 60 minutes , this 90-minute movie keeps you hooked . Then it sets about breaking all the rules it has set up and massive gaps in logic distract your attention from the increasingly preposterous climax . I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming . But it came too early and led the film into stupidness . It is atmospherically shot and the feeling of isolation is quite cool , even if it doesn't last very long .

Losing the upper hand in a night club he barely escapes with his life ( and baggage in the form of Willie Scott and sidekick kid Short Round ) to the airport . But little does he know the plane he gets on is owned by Lau Che and the pilots sneak out in mid-air while they are sleeping . After jumping to safety in an inflatable dinghy Indy , Willie and Short Round drift by an Indian village that has been stricken with bad luck since the theft of their magical Shankara stones . Encouraged by the villagers to go to Pankot palace and retrieve the stones , Indy has no idea that what he will find involves an evil cult hellbent on taking over the world with their lunatic new religion . Temple of Doom is , without a shadow of a doubt , the best Indiana Jones film . I know a lot of nerds are going to disagree with me but I do think it superior to Raiders of the Lost Ark because I prefer the darker , nastier tone and the fact that it just doesn't let up from the word ' go ' ! Two hours of Temple of Doom's running time pass in a breeze of sheer adventure as Spielberg takes us from one memorable set-piece to another . The opening musical number , the fight in the Obi-Wan Club , the chase through Shanghai , the plane crash / dingy ride , the journey to Pankot Palace , the dinner scene , the human sacrifice , the freeing of the slaves , the mine-cart ride , the water rush , the rope bridge , the cliff-hanging . . . wow ! How much more can you pack into a film ? It's physically impossible ! Originally criticised on it's release for being too dark , Temple of Doom still ends up being a classic . I guess the audiences of 1984 were expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark 2 and were taken aback when they got something else . If you watch it with the others you can feel how different the film is with no scenes taking place in America , no University and no Sallah or Marcus Brody . John Williams ' brilliant music is also at it's best . He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark , which is quite rare . The film did win an Oscar for its visual effects ( beating the equally impressive effects of Ghostbusters ) which , when viewed today , at least might seem a little bit dated , but still hold up quite well .

994,"Text1: When THE FORTUNE COOKIE came out in 1965 it proved a remarkably successful comedy . Of course it was directed by Billy Wilder , still at or near the height of his film career with a string of great successes from THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR , THE LOST WEEKEND , and SUNSET BOULDVARD through SOME LIKE IT HOT and THE APARTMENT . Of course there had been less successful films for Wilder , most notably THE EMPEROR WALTZ and THE BIG CARNIVAL , but most of his films were widely respected by critics and the public . And when he made it in 1965 it was to star Jack Lemmon , who had demonstrated his comic qualities in three other Wilder films : SOME LIKE IT HOT , THE APARTMENT , and IRMA LA DOUCE . So the public was quite interested in this film , which was to tear into the American habit of suing for injuries , and into shyster lawyers . In fact , the screenplay was originally supposed to be MEET WHIPLASH WILLY , the final name of the film when shown in England . What surprised many people was the casting of Walter Matthau as "" Whiplash Willie "" Gingrich , the shyster brother-in-law to Lemmon's Harry Hinkle . Matthau was a widely respected actor , with great stage experience , but his performances in movies had been mostly as villains . From the whip happy tavern keeper in THE KENTUCKIAN , to the Machiavellian government adviser in FAIL SAFE Matthau usually played unlikeable sorts . There were some exceptions . In A FACE IN THE CROWD he is one of the television people who assist Lonesome Rhodes ( Andy Griffith ) on his way up , but who are appalled at the monster they create . When , at the end of the film , Griffith is starting to think of how to overcome the huge gaffe he created over the airwaves that have sent his career into the dumpster , it is Matthau ( a terrific figure of decency here ) who tells Griffith that he won't be coming back , but will be lucky to be remembered in a few years as a has-been . But A FACE IN THE CROWD was a rarity for Matthau . If he played comedy it was as a villain , most chillingly in CHARADES as Mr . Bartholemew . In his scenes as an embassy official he had some good comic bits , like when he offers a cigarette to Audrey Hepburn , and she takes two puffs and puts it out - Matthau is put out by this waste of one of his pricey cigarettes ! It is Matthau's appearance in THE FORTUNE COOKIE that changed his public persona and his career . He went to town as Whiplash Willy , threatening to sue the United Fruit Company for failing to put a printed warning on their bananas after Howard McNear fell and broke his pelvis tripping on one . His careful manipulation of brother-in-law Lemmon / Hinkle , his calculating in how to force a major law firm to surrender unconditionally in his demands , his snide comments about great lawyers of the past ( Lincoln , Darrow ) , all build up a to a great introductory performance . It really showed the Matthau that the public would grow to know - a cynical type who could make others ( especially the more decent Lemmon ) do what he wanted them to . He would also be quick to get into deeply pseudo-intellectual speeches , voicing his opinions and points of views . It was the Matthau who would entertain movie audiences for the next three decades . As a sign of his success in finding his persona , Matthau won the Best Supporting Oscar for THE FORTUNE COOKIE . Lemmon recommended Matthau to Wilder , who was pushing either Frank Sinatra or Jackie Gleason . It is quite hard to imagine either the Chairman of the Board or the Great One as effective as Matthau . But I have long wondered if Wilder and Lemmon had had someone else in mind , someone who was no longer available . The Hinkle - Gingrich relationship was a close one due to their family relationship , and Wilder certainly had discussed the issue of the casting with Lemmon . Up to 1961 , Lemmon had appeared , most often , with one actor in the movies - in comedies . He appeared in BELL , BOOK , and CANDLE , IT STARTED WITH JANE , and OPERATION MAD BALL with his close friend Ernie Kovacs . Lemmon had been so close to Kovacs that he appeared ( in the disguise of a monkey suit ) as one of the Nairobi Trio . There are some lines in THE FORTUNE COOKIE that sound ready made for Kovacs - for example , when he writes a figure down as a settlement figure , and when the other lawyers make their counter-offers Matthau repeats it each time , looks at the paper , and says , very quietly , "" That isn't it ! "" One can easily see Kovacs saying the same thing the same way . If , as I suspect , THE FORTUNE COOKIE was an idea of Wilder's and Diamond's for a few years , it is just possible that Lemmon suggested Kovacs for the role of Gingrich . But after Kovacs died in a car accident in 1962 , Lemmon had to find another actor of similar type . And then he noticed Matthau , who in 1965 was well received for his performance in THE ODD COUPLE on Broadway . Kovacs ' bad luck may very well have been Matthau's good luck . Today we think of the Lemmon-Matthau partnership as really based on their films with Wilder . They did four films with Wilder , but after THE FORTUNE COOKIE it was their joint appearance in the film version of THE ODD COUPLE directed by Gene Saks that made the partnership viable . Otherwise it might have seemed a flash in the pan . THE ODD COUPLE was to prove that the chemistry between the actors did not solely defend on the artistry of Wilder .

Text2: The economic monsters of the 1980s and 1990s included vast corporate take-overs for the purpose of the selling off of corporate assets . Frequently the assets separately were more valuable than the corporate whole . That this lead to economic dislocation for the employees of the corporations rarely was considered by the men who planned and carried out the raids and takeovers . Three films really got involved in this matter . They were WALL STREET , wherein "" Gordon Gecko "" ( Michael Douglas ) told an audience of stockholders that "" greed is good "" and that it might even save the United States ! A more balanced version was presented by Danny DeVito as "" Larry the Liquidator "" in OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY . Then came this nice little fairy tale , mixing the world of Cinderella with the world of Dow Jones and some Freud . PRETTY WOMEN is probably the most popular of the three films , because Julia Robert's "" Vivian Ward "" humanizes the corporate raider "" Edward Lewis "" ( Richard Gere ) and thus they manage to save each other . Economic realities remain in PRETTY WOMEN . Vivian , and her pal Kit De Luca ( Laura San Giacomo ) are hookers . They both are smarter than most but they are at the mercy of mean streets , mean Johns , and possibly mean pimps . Ironically they both work in Hollywood , only blocks away from the super rich . One night Vivian is picked up by a man in a fancy sports car . It is Edward , who is planning a hostile take-over of a ship building empire owned by James Morse ( Ralph Bellamy ) , with the assistance of his long-time legal aide Philip Stuckey ( Jason Alexander ) . Edward has just left one of Stuckey's parties ( Stuckey tries to be as ingratiating to the aloof Edward as he can - and mistakenly thinks he has succeeded in being so ) . Needing real release , Edward takes Vivian to his hotel suite . What begins as a paid trick ends differently . FVivian is able to lighten Edward's spirits slowly so that he enjoys her for her company as well as the sex . Then the corporate raid gets so complex that Edward has to take an entire week to conclude it . Edward offers Vivian a chance to make a small fortune if she will stay with him for the week . After some bargaining ( which she is good at ) she agrees . She learns that having money does not mean being acceptable . She is asked to get some fancy dinner clothing for a meeting with Morse and his grandson David ( Alex Hyde-White ) . She tries to get the clothing at a snobbish store on Rodeo Drive , and is humiliated by the hostile staff . Subsequently she also has a brief problem with the manager of the hotel Barney Thompson ( Hector Elizondo ) , but it clears up when members of the staff vouch for her being with Edward . Subsequently Barney turns out to be sympathetic to Vivian's needs for assistance for getting a decent dress and for learning proper eating etiquette . When Edward learns about the nastiness of the staff at the snobbish store he assists Vivian in getting more fancy clothing , and Vivian has a choice moment of revenge on the snobs . Edward is soon planning how to force Morse to the wall , but Stuckey is curious about a type of distance in this business deal that is developing between Edward and the project , and ( worse to Stuckey ) between Edward and him . Edward is soon spending increasing times away to be with Vivian . While much of their time is between the sheets , they also are enjoying each other's company and she is teaching him to ease up and release his human side . He explains to her that his business habits were based on a hatred of his father , a man who deserted his mother and Edward for another woman . After Edward's mother died , Edward went to work to make himself into the corporate raider he became , and his first great victory was the destruction of his father's company . He has been repeating this success ever since - but ( despite one small victory due to therapy ) he is not a happy person . Vivian explains that she grew up in an unhappy poor family , and she left to try to improve herself , but she never graduated high school ( despite being quite sharp ) . She also has always dreamed of one day finding a man who could rescue her - her image of him based on how her mother would lock her in a closet as punishment and her knight / prince would come to release her . The fairy tale element in the film frequently hides the Freudian image of both leads - neither having had happy childhoods . We never learn of Vivian's relations with her Dad , but she and her mother were quite at odds . We know that Edward blamed his father for the death ( soon after his father's desertion ) of Edward's mother . Both are strong , capable figures , but both are desperately unhappy ones . As the film heads to it's conclusions ( there are several ) we realize they should be together - neither will ever fully function well without the other ( although they would both survive ) . But they have to overcome their equal repugnance at each other's lifestyle : Vivian has to get Edward away from constantly destroying his father again and again by corporate raiding ( especially after she meets the Morses ) , and Edward keeps wanting to get Vivian off those mean streets - but keeps fumbling trying to overcome his dislike of her being a prostitute . The film succeeds as the two characters break with their pasts . In the end corporate raiding and prostitution are discarded ( not only by the main characters , but Vivian even pushes Kit towards cleaning up her act ) , and the last image of Edward and Vivian holding each other for support on an old building's fire escape . We know they'll make it .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

This is an OK film but it's also too long for what it is , I guess time was needed for character development or something ? Yeah , right . Michael Ironsides plays a nut-case that has a thing for a woman's activist , played by Lee Grant . . . . no , he's not wildly in love with her , he just wants her dead . Because she's an interfering type and he lashes out at anyone that speaks up for others . He breaks into her home & hides out until she arrives and then attempts to kill her , but she's only injured and ends up in County General , where security doesn't seem to be too tight because he doesn't seem to have too much trouble getting in to stalk her . There's also a young nurse that is assigned to care for her & since she's there she apparently needs stalking too . William Shatner has kind of a throw-away role in this as the editor of the TV program Grant has , of course he's always the voice of reason and political correctness and you wish the stalker would take him out too . This has a good 80's feel to it , but it really is quite long for a slasher flick and could have used a bit of editing . There's also some chick that Ironsides picks up in a bar and beats up , because he's unable to perform in the sack & so takes his frustrations out elsewhere , which was a bad move on his part because she and some friends come back to trash his apartment and she finds evidence in his closet that he's a bit of a wacko , like pictures of dead people in his closet that he took at the hospital , oops .

Text2: Silent is Ondoubtably one of Chuck Norris'best movies . Chuck plays Dan Stevens , small town sheriff who responds to a domestic disturbance and discovers a murder . but that is the least of his worries . he find out the killer is still in the house . after a very long struggle , the killer is shot by police and killed . all seems well , but then murders star happening again and Dan is called in to investigate . let's just say that Dan finds out the hard way that the killer is not so dead . and he is no ordinary man . Dan tracks the maniac down and confronts him , using all his martial arts abilities . the psycho escapes and Dan barely escapes with his life . the most refreshing thing about his movie is the fact that the villain is more than worthy of our hero . in many such films of this genre , the villain is easily and soundly beaten , while the hero sometimes escapes without a scratch . obviously not very realistic . this time , the villain is not just a punching bag . in fact the good guy is in peril at times . the fight scenes are good , especially the climax . the movie also brings up some interesting moral and ethical issues , which are way ahead of their time . aside from that , this is one of Chuck's better movies . very entertaining .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
997,"Text1: I'm going to go ahead and assume that it's not an easy task to make a crowd-pleasing movie centered on politics that goes to such strenuous efforts to be non-partisan and maybe chalk up my dissatisfaction with the movie to that . Then again , it might also have something to do with a critical decision that they made in how to end the movie , which is sure to make every single solitary person who watches it throw up their arms in disgust . But the movie is not about who wins the presidency , it's about the pure chaos of the American political system and its millions of weaknesses and faults . Sure , the premise of a presidential election coming down to a single vote is as preposterous as they come , but man if this movie doesn't get you thinking critically about the electoral process then it's safe to assume that probably nothing ever will . Kevin Costner plays Bud , an American nobody from New Mexico who has never done anything with his life except have a daughter with a delusional drug addict who thinks she has a big singing career in her near future . He works as an egg inspector at an egg packaging plant , and he and his co-workers mourn the loss of their friends ' ( and soon , their own ) jobs to "" insourcing , "" the process of bringing Mexicans in to take their jobs rather than ship the factory and all those egg-laying chickens to Mexico . Bud staggers through life in a drunken daze most of the time , routinely letting down his daughter Molly ( Madeline Carroll ) , who raises him like a child . She gets him out of bed in the morning , criticizes his laziness and irresponsibility , reminds him to vote because it's part of a school project that she has to do , and through sighs of exasperation attempts to keep him at least a little bit in line . And of course it's the only thing in life that she fails at . When Bud gets drunk rather than show up to vote , she manages to almost cast his vote herself due to the sleepy voting booth security of beautiful Texico , New Mexico , which Google Earth has just informed me is a real place . Population 1 , 065 . In a clever plot development , it turns out that Bud's vote didn't go completely through but it appeared that he was there , so he is given another opportunity to cast his vote . Not right away , mind you , even though he evidently already tried to vote and thus probably had his mind made up . No , he is given ten days before he has to vote , thus providing plenty of time for a movie to happen . Young Madeline Carroll steals most of the scenes that she's in as Bud's daughter , so it's interesting that her character is one of the biggest weak points in the movie , the other one being her dad . Bud is supposed to be a typical American , but I just saw a drifting drunk who never did anything with his life and never would have had he not been forced to . It's true that the vast majority of Americans live lives that are closer to Bud's than President Boone's ( Kelsey Grammar ) , but does he have to be a TOTAL loser ? How about just making him be a likable , regular guy ? Like the guy he played in Field of Dreams ? When I imagine the average American , I imagine something like Ray Kinsella . Although maybe with a slightly smaller house and less whispering from the sky . The other problem is that the screenwriters overshot the character of Molly by about 160 IQ points . So much for the average American , right ? This girl writes a school essay that doesn't merit a special award from the principal to show her dad , it grants her NATIONAL TELEVISED RECOGNITION . But to be honest , I had more of a problem with the fact that not only does she wake her deadbeat dad up in the morning so he could take her to school , she also treks to the bar and , finding him passed out in his truck when he should have been voting , she pushes him over and then drives him home herself . She's about 11 years old . But where the movie succeeds is as a scathing revelation about certain realities of the American electoral process , such as the electoral college , which simplifies the vote-counting process even while massively distorting the actual numbers of who voted for who . The whole movie is about how one man's vote really does matter , but it leaves you with the feeling that you are supposed to forget that once he votes , every single vote in his state for the other candidate WON'T matter anymore , because they'll be switched to the other candidate . Isn't it interesting how that works ? Can't we just count every single vote and award each candidate one huge number of individual votes ? Seems a little more accurate to me . Anyway , I do appreciate the way the movie highlights the fact that both sides , Republican and Democrat , are equally willing to stoop to any level and do absolutely whatever it takes to win , and that no one is above hitting below the belt and making hugely unethical decisions . There is a lot that needs to be changed in American politics , and even while clearly being based on the Election of 2000 , one of the most controversial in American history , it calls those things to attention without ever even hinting that either side is right or wrong . The movie insists that America is the greatest country in the world but that in some ways , we're doing it all wrong , but the fact that a movie like this has the freedom to get made proves that even though we haven't reached a level of pure cohesive harmony , underneath all of our imperfections is a clear desire to get there .

Text2: Although Clint Eastwood's recent Flags of Our Fathers has told the real story about the flag raising at Iwo Jima , it hasn't diminished any of the impact that Sands of Iwo Jima has , either back when it was released or viewed today . In fact because the three surviving flag raisers , Joseph Bradley , Rene Gagnon , and Ira Hayes all were in this film it's even more proof of how the symbolic flag raising has become mythologized . Of course the real heroism was in capturing the island that was less than a 1000 miles from the main islands of Japan and the airfields on Iwo Jima that could be used by our bombers for land based flights . It took about a month to do that , the flag was raised on the fifth day . I read a history of the United States Marine Corps from it's formation during the American Revolution . Over the course of its history it was interesting to learn that the Marines many times were threatened with extinction , to be folded into either the army or navy right up to and including World War I . Right after World War I a very farsighted man named John A . Lejeune became the Marine Corps Commandant and he saw that we would be in a war in the Pacific with the Japanese as our foes . He also saw that the survival of the Marines as an entity involved them training for a very specialized kind of mission , amphibious warfare . He started training them for that and come World War II they were certainly ready . John Wayne as Sergeant Striker got one of his most memorable parts of his career in Sands of Iwo Jima . Striker is a tough as nails Marine Corps lifer whose got a job to whip a lot of recruits into shape for the later Pacific landings after Guadalcanal . He's also got one lousy personal life as his wife's left him and taken their son . Wayne got his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor in this part . There's a couple of other films he should have gotten a nomination for , but that's another story . Among his competition in 1949 was Kirk Douglas for Champion , Richard Todd for The Hasty Heart , and Gregory Peck for Twelve O'Clock High . Note three of the nominees were for World War II related films . But the winner that year was Broderick Crawford for All the King's Men . At least Peck and Wayne both got Oscars later in their careers . John Agar who was trying to carve out a reputation as being more than Mr . Shirley Temple back then plays the son of a former commander of Wayne's who has a problem with his Dad and takes it out on Wayne attitude wise as a surrogate father . Julie Bishop and Adele Mara play women drawn to both Wayne and Agar respectively . Of the supporting cast who play members of Wayne's platoon , my favorite is Wally Cassell , the wisecracking city kid who finds a tank to help his platoon out during a sticky situation . Flags of Our Fathers teaches us about how the flag raising symbolism became part of the Marine Corps heritage . Sands of Iwo Jima exploits that symbol in the best sense of the word . After almost sixty years , it's still a fine film with a grand performance by the Duke .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
998,"Text1: This for some reason is my book called 1001 Films You Must See Before You Die , why ? In my opinion it is just the tiniest bit of a pointless film . Who thought of the idea for this film , a guy travelling to see his sick Dad , wow , that's it . Anyway , Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson plays Robert Eroica Dupea . He is some kind of construction worker and he hears that his Dad is sick , and he decides to go on a road trip to see him . Basically his Dad is sick with some kind of problem hearing and understanding . Personally , the only good part for me is when Nicholson tries to order an omelet lunch in a café , but I can't remember it all , and I want to be certain of my opinion . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Supporting Actress for Karen Black as Rayette Dipesto ( she won the Golden Globe ) , Best Writing , Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced and Best Picture , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama , Best Director for Bob Rafelson and Best Screenplay . Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor .

Text2: If you've seen the Sir Alfred Hitchcock film classic The Lady Vanishes , then this is a reversion of that film , except instead of on a train , it's on a plane . Basically , in Berlin , aircraft propulsion engineer Kyle Pratt ( Jodie Foster ) has recently lost her husband , who supposedly fell off their building roof . She has quit her job and is travelling with her traumatised six year old daughter Julia ( Marlene Lawston ) to New York to bury the body in Long Island . While in flight Kyle falls asleep , and wakes to see her daughter is gone . She has a quick look around , and eventually panic and conspiracy starts as she requests Captain Rich ( Sean Bean ) to have all staff search for her . But the manifest has no evidence of the girl she is describing to them , and with more desperate actions she is becoming a threat to the aircraft , so steps in Air Marshal Gene Carson ( Peter Sarsgaard ) . Kyle is taking drastic actions to get the plane searched from top to bottom , or better yet get it to land , which she succeeds in doing . Eventually we find out who is really responsible for the missing daughter , and has plans to blow the plane up , and you may have thought everyone was in on it , well , it's the person you probably least suspect , Carson , and boy does he get his comeuppance . Also starring Marlene Lawston as Julia , Erika Christensen as Fiona , Kate Beahan as Stephanie , Greta Scacchi as Therapist , Judith Scott as Estella , Michael Irby as Obaid and Brent Sexton as Elias . If you have a fear of flying or suffer claustrophobia , then you'll definitely be affected by this film , this has all the right elements that grip you just enough to believe most of it , the ending I guess is pretty improbable , and a little obvious ( so you feel cheated ) , but Foster is always good , and supporting cast members Sarsgaard and Bean are really good too .

999,"Text1: Cube 2 : Hypercube starts as Kate Filmore ( Kari Matchett ) awakes to find herself in a square room , a cube if you will . On each of the six faces of the cube is a hatch which opens & leads to an identical cube whose hatches lead to even more identical cube shaped rooms . As she goes from cube to cube she meets other people , there's Simon ( Geraint Wyn Davies ) , a blind girl named Sasha ( Grace Lynn Kung ) , a computer games designer Max ( Matthew Ferguson ) , Jerry ( Neil Crone ) , a senile old woman name Mrs Paley ( Barbara Gordon ) , lawyer Julia ( Lindsey Connell ) & General Thomas Maguire ( Bruce Gray ) who all find themselves trapped within an endless succession of cubes with no food , water or idea how to get out . As they learn about each other they must work together to try & figure out how to escape the seeming endlessness of the cube . . . This Canadian production was directed by Andrzej Sekula who was also the director of photography & was the first sequel to the ingenious & rather funky sci-fi / horror film Cube ( 1997 ) . I have now seen all the Cube films , although admittedly some months apart & in the wrong order , & I have to say Cube 2 : Hypercube is my least favourite although it's still probably worth a watch . The script by Sean Hood , Ernie Barbarash & Lauren McLaughlin takes the basic Cube premise of strangers being stuck in a cube & having to figure a way out & puts a couple of twists on things which in my opinion are not effective . The simplicity & fascination of the original is lacking here as the filmmakers introduce this silly fourth dimension thing which means all sorts of time-lines meet each other & gravity starts to get messed up , I just liked the pureness of the original Cube which is just absent here . For some reason they've done away with the bobby traps in the rooms as well , surely that's a mistake ? I also didn't like the somewhat predictable twist ending & the character's are poor this time around with most of them having some tenuous & dull reason to be there . The other factor to bear in mind is that while the Cube films are unique generally speaking they aren't amongst themselves which means there are another two films that are almost identical to this & out of the three films Cube 2 : Hypercube is the worst . Director Andrzej does an OK job although there's not much you can do to enliven a film up set entirely within one room shaped like a cube . He seems to like spinning the camera round peoples heads which can get a bit dizzying at times . There's no gore or violence this time around & why they did away with the bobby traps I'll never know . Technically Cube 2 : Hypercube is alright , what could go wrong with such a basic concept ? Having said that some of the CGI effects look really cheap & are unimpressive . The acting was OK but nothing special . Cube 2 : Hypercube is an OK watch , if you've never seen a Cube film before then you'll probably like it more than those that have . I suppose there's nothing really wrong with it other than it had an almost impossible task of following the original which it does with no great distinction . Average at best . The last , to date , film in the series was Cube Zero ( 2004 ) which is better than this .

1000,"Text1: The Dardenne brothers ' devotees who admired such strong works as "" Rosetta "" ( 1999 ) or "" le Fils "" ( 2002 ) , why not giving a go to this piece of work that the two Belgian brothers created in 1992 ? But be warned , don't expect something of the same caliber or intensity like the films quoted above . As a matter of fact , although it doesn't really shelter the Dardenne brothers ' style , "" Je Pense à Vous "" already encapsulates a part of their trademark and what will be later developed in their forthcoming movies . First : the surroundings with the world of the underprivileged and those left behind by progress and modernity , victims of unemployment , social crisis and injustices . Then , ill-fated characters who got a raw deal and struggle hard to make ends meet and persevere their dignities . The two brothers will tap again these features for their subsequent films and will be Ken Loach's Belgian answer . Besides , maybe was it the right time for them to broach and construe this kind of cinema at a time when the respectable British filmmaker decided to put his camera in the world of the dropouts and to listen to them from "" Riff-Raff "" ( 1990 ) onwards . With a little help from Jean Gruault who thirty years before had collaborated with François Truffaut for the writing of his celebrated "" Jules et Jim "" ( 1962 ) , it's evident that the Dardenne brothers were searching for a directorial style to enable them to distinguish themselves . Their set of themes is palpable here but their style isn't . The features which will make them recognizable among others are virtually absent : no tight editing , no hand-held camera , no documentary aspect , no rare dialogs . Instead , very worked sequences which bestow the film with lyricism , an evocative music and a courageous portrait of Fabrice ( Robin Renucci ) . His job as a steel worker makes him proud but everything goes askew on the day he's dismissed from his job . As he feels pointless , he refuses a job as a photoengraver and slowly drifts , leaving his wife ( Fabienne Babe ) worried . As I said before , the Dardenne brothers ' stylish directing isn't present here but it doesn't stop the film from being eminently watchable in spite of flaws : some embarrassing ellipsis hamper the good vision of the story which accumulates stereotyped protagonists and predictable turns in the second half of the film and one can deem the ending as too cozy and easy . In the two brothers ' next films , happy-end will be shelved . But the actors make this warm-up lap worthwhile and notably Robin Renucci whom Claude Chabrol's fans saw in his excellent "" Masques "" ( 1987 ) . As for the Dardenne brothers , they will keep their promises from their next film onwards , "" la Promesse "" ( 1996 ) ! The seeds are sown , now all they have to do is to grow and ripen

1002,"Text1: Lucrecia Martel , the talented director of "" La Cienaga "" , creates a dark picture with this film that takes place in the northern part of Argentina that borders Bolivia . Having seen "" La nina santa "" prior to watching this movie , there is a sort of connection between the two , as the director explores the darker side of human beings , which seems to consume her . "" La Cienaga "" is a film that mirrored the times when it was made . The last part of the 20th century was devastating for Argentina as most people were affected by the rapid changes in the economy that befell the land . As the film starts , we suffer from disorientation . We are taken to Mecha's house in the country where a group of people are seen sitting around the swimming pool . No one says anything to one another ; it's as though the oppressing heat has numbed everyone . The only thing left to do is to drink to oblivion . Mecha appears to be inebriated when she tripped and fell . The wine glass cuts her in the chest . Blood is seen all over the place . Then , as though by magic , we are taken to meet Tali and her family , who appear to live in town . There is a sharp contrast between the two households . Where Mecha's house is run down , it still shows signs of a richer past . Tali's home , on the other hand , is a much humbler place . Ms . Martel makes a subtle comment on what she shows us . There are a lot of things that are wrong in Mecha's house , like the lesbianism shown between one of her daughters and the maid . Incest is also hinted when Jose , the older son , who has come from Buenos Aires to see his mother after her accident , shows a sick interest in his beautiful sister . He enters the bathroom while she is taking a shower . At the same time , we are shown on the television set , an incident where people are attesting to seeing the Virgin Mary in a water tank on the roof of a house . The director imbues the film in symbolism , which seems to be hard for viewers to follow . The story is deeper than what the images present for our viewing . That is why this enigmatic film did not reach a wide audience . It's a shame because Lucrecia Martel's film has a hypnotic way to get us involved . Graciela Borges , an Argentine film star in her own right , plays Mecha , a woman of the moneyed society who appears to have seen better days . Ms . Borges underplays her character , achieving a great appearance . Mercedes Moran , who played Helena in "" La nina santa "" , is seen as Lita , Mecha's cousin , Lita shows a lot of common sense . She also has a lot of problems , but she is much grounded than her cousin that is decaying in the old country estate . The ensemble cast is also good . While "" La Cienaga "" is a disturbing work . Lucrecia Martel wrote and directed with great style . It's worth a look of fans of the Argentine cinema because it shows one of the most original talents in a film that dares to go where others don't .

Text2: Howard Hughes was a producer that had a lot of talent for discovering beautiful women that went on to have better careers with other vehicles than the ones he decided to create for them . That seems to be the case of this John Sturges ' 1955 film "" Underwater ! "" in which the curvaceous Jane Russell starred for the last time for Howard Hughes . The film is a curious one . We are introduced to Johnny and Dominic , two underwater divers who are searching for those sunken ships in the Caribbean , especially this one , not too far from Cuba . As they stumble into the old Spanish galleon , they find a man that appears to be a sort of pirate awaiting for them because it's obvious they are after those treasures . As Johnny and Dominic go back to Cuba , we are introduced to Theresa , Johnny's wife , who is dead set against spending money chasing his dreams . But when Dominic meets Gloria , by chance , she tells him about the yacht she has been left with by a departing old flame . So the four friends , and a priest who knows about those sunk ships , go in search of the riches trapped underwater . The film doesn't bring anything new to this film genre . In fact , it's pretty tame stuff we see in a predictable story we know how it will end . The best reward for the viewers of "" Underwater "" is the beautiful Jane Russell at her best .

It's a sobering thought that Ken Loach probably hero-worshipped Cayette and almost certainly saw him as a role model . There is , thankfully , one large difference between guru and disciple and that is that unlike Loach Cayette doesn't forget to add a top layer to his diatribes in the shape of Entertainment . He actually provides a storyline that CAN , if one is so inclined , be viewed merely as drama , the Social Comment is there all right but unlike Loach it's not in yer face so if , for example , you want to view this film as nothing more than the tale of a group of youngsters who feel alienated and / or dispossessed and embark on a naive scheme to bankroll a trip to their idea of paradise then do that . These kids are in their mid teens so that in 1954 they'd lived through most of WW2 and the period of austerity that followed ; the Cold War is well underway as is Korea so little wonder they dream of tropical islands if only they had some serious money . We know because we've seen movies like The Asphalt Jungle - and will see it's successor The Killing in a couple of years - that even robberies that are planned meticulously over months and to the last detail have a way of unravelling if only because Crime could not be SEEN to pay in those halcyon days so what chance a scheme based on I'll cosy up to this rich guy , accept an invitation to his apartment and THEN , while his back's turned I'll leave the french window unlocked so that YOU can get in and take anything portable that we can sell . Oh , yes , should you be disturbed in the middle of this , by a cop , for example , you're on your own . Exactly . Which is , of course , what happens . Cayette , who was not averse to dealing with such emotive subjects as euthanasia starts by framing the parents in the courtroom as if it is them and not the kids who are on trial and he allows each one a flashback to reinforce the culpability . Overall it's a fine film with a cast largely unknown outside France with the exception of Bernard Blier and certainly has value as an example of domestic cinema in the early fifties .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: In this , the pilot episode of "" Get Smart "" , CONTROL agent Maxwell Smart ( Don Adams ) gets a call from the Chief ( Edward Platt ) to rescue a scientist who's invented something that's in the hand of the criminal organization called KAOS . He is to meet Agent 99 ( Barbara Feldon ) at a certain place . From there , the fun begins . . . With today being the general release day of the new movie version of "" Get Smart "" with Steve Carell in the title role , I thought I'd finally watch the very first episode of this classic television comedy series that Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created some 43 years ago . And yes , there's a "" and "" instead of a "" with "" in the writing credits when the two get credited here . This is where we first see the shoe phone and the cone of silence , hear Max's famous lines "" And loving it ! "" and "" Would you believe . . . "" ( while Smart says sorry a few times , there's no "" . . . about that , Chief ! "" yet ) And it's here that he-and we-first see 99 and though we know it's a woman , Max doesn't realize it yet since she's in uniform with a cap on . Plenty of funny lines abound with some of my favorites during the cone of silence sequence which turns into a "" Who's on First ?

Also loved the code sentence being about the Mets winning so when Max hears a little boy say it , he asks if he's 99 . "" No , I'm six and a half , "" comes the reply . And then there's the meeting with Mr . Big . . . If there's some quibble here , it's that 99 seems a bit too kowtowed to Max for my tastes and the fights are soooo fake here . Still , this was quite an entertaining beginning for the beloved comedy series that lasted five seasons on the air . P . S .

1005,"Text1: ' Village Tale ' is based on a novel by Philip Stong , an Iowa newspaperman who is now best remembered for writing ' State Fair ' , which became a Rodgers & Hammerstein musical . Actually , the best-known piece of text authored by Stong is not usually attributed to him . It was Stong who wrote the widely-reprinted statement that was purportedly spoken in prison by anarchist Bartolomeo Vanzetti shortly before his execution : the document that figures prominently in ' The Male Animal ' . Stong once attributed his writing career to having fallen out of a bath at age two . Although Stong was born and raised in Iowa , and most of his fiction is set there , it's significant that - as soon as his stories and novels about Iowans became successful - he moved to Connecticut and stayed there . On a lighter note , I once interviewed Stong's niece Norma Lyon at an Iowa agricultural fair while she carved a life-size statue of Elvis out of butter ! I saw ' Village Tale ' in New York City in 1992 , at the New School for Social Research , during one of William K Everson's screenings . This IMDb review is based on notes that I took at that screening . Apart from my notes , I'm dismayed that I have almost no memories of this film ; ' Village Tale ' made almost no impression on me . It's a boring , sententious movie : most of the characters are archetypes on the verge of becoming stereotypes . The village in this movie could be Mayberry's evil twin . It's one of those soap-opera whistle-stops where everyone has a Dark Secret : like Peyton Place , but with less sex . Most of the local yokels spend their days hanging about the cracker barrel in the general store , whittlin ' and chawin ' and deciding whose life to destroy next , ' cos there ain't rightly nothin ' else to do in these heah parts . SYNOPSIS WITH SPOILERS . Randolph Scott has an innocent crush on Kay Johnson , who's trapped in a loveless marriage to Arthur Hohl . The village gossips - purely from spite , and lacking anything else to do - convince Hohl that Scott has cuckolded him , driving Hohl to attempt to murder Scott . Meanwhile , meek little Donald Meek gets beaten to death by village bully Robert Barrat . Donald Meek was a character actor whom I consistently find annoying and overly mannered , so I was glad that he got beaten to death in this film , but disappointed that it happens offscreen . When the yokels finish having fun with Scott and Johnson , they move on to their next victim . ' Village Tale ' is an utterly depressing film , totally devoid of humour or introspection . I wouldn't want to meet any of these people , and I wouldn't much fancy spending five minutes in their village . The direction , by John Cromwell , is up to his usual high standard , but he's got bad material to work with here . The screenplay is by Allan Scott , whose work I usually admire . As I've not read Stong's novel , I can't tell if the badness of this material is down to the source material or Scott's script . Edward Ellis gives his usual good performance as an unsavoury character . Arthur Hohl and Robert Barrat are sadly underrated character actors who deserve to be better known , but neither of them gives an especially good performance here . I'll rate ' Village Tale ' just .

Text2: I saw this 7-minute Japanese silent film in October 2005 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Sacile , Italy : the festival screened a 35mm print . Since the film has no intertitles , there was no language barrier . I've seen references to this film as a documentary , but that's incorrect . It would be more accurate to cry this movie as a newsreel , since it merely records a recent event rather than describing and explaining that event as a documentary would have done . Tomijiro Kobayashi ( 1852-1910 ) was a hugely wealthy Japanese industrialist who founded the company Kobayashi Shoten , which ultimately became known as the Lion Corporation as it expanded and prospered . The firm originally sold dentrifices , toothpaste and other products which we would now call ' health and beauty aids ' : it eventually offered a much wider range of merchandise , and Kobayashi's holdings provided employment to thousands of Japanese workers . For modern viewers , the most interesting aspects of this film are its views of Japanese streets and traditional funeral pageantry . As someone who has helped track down some so-called ' lost ' films , I'm very intrigued that sometimes the story of a film's fate is more interesting ( to me , at least ) than the movie itself . This is one such movie . The film was produced by Yoshizawa Shoten , one of Japan's first cinema companies . Following the movie's release to Japanese cinemas in 1910 , the original nitrate negative and one release print were carefully preserved in a purpose-built wooden box , and ceremonially presented to the Japanese government's nearest equivalent to the U . S . A . ' s Library of Congress ( although a very distant equivalent ; if the Japanese archives were as retentive as the Library of Congress , far more Japanese films would have survived ! ) . In the 1950s , the Japanese government ( with some nudging from U . S . occupation forces ) radically tightened fire-safety laws , effecting almost a total ban on films printed on highly combustible nitrate stock . As a result , nearly all of Japan's early films were either deliberately destroyed or allowed to self-destruct . This film , in its elaborate presentation box , survived . The print which I viewed at Sacile is an acetate dupe , struck by the National Film Centre in Tokyo . More for its historic significance than for any aesthetic content , I'll rate this newsreel .

"" The Unborn "" is a very reasonable low-budget horror movie .

1007,"Text1: Badlands , based on the relationship between Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate ( and later an inspiration for Tarantino's True Romance and NBK ) , never has a moment where something un-realistic curries . Writer / producer / director Terence Malick leads his film along with a true emphasis on both the psychological nature of Kit ( Martin Sheen ) and Holly ( Sissy Spacek ) , and with the un-canny knack for a relaxing style in his camera . At best , Badlands is one of the successful homages to European cinema of the 1970's , something that will last a long time due to its pairing of absorbing art-house and ( perhaps ) mainstream sensibilities . At worst , a viewer could feel bored with Malick's intent on running with his poetic ideas as a director . If there was any pretentiousness at all , it went over my head ; this is a film that draws you into its tragic nature . Sheen and Spacek are totally believable as a couple on the run , as Kit continually has a trigger-happy attitude to people after he shoots Holly's father . While Spacek holds the heart of the picture steady , I'd have to say that Sheen's Kit is one of his best performances . He comes off in the perfect sense - you wouldn't think for a second that Kit could be a killer , that is until he pulls out his pistol . It works just as well that Holly is the narrator , so that the viewer can understand where Kit's coming from , and where he's going . If there is any distance between his character and the audience , there's still a strong , emotional connection through Spacek , and their bond as a loving , if dangerous , couple . Overall , Badlands is extraordinary in a way that doesn't cram its atmospheric from start to finish on the audience , and it looks at young people in love , however in such twisted circumstances , in an honest way in how escalatory events create a disillusioned feeling in youth . That it's made on such a low budget gives it more merit . Kudos should go to the musical score by James Taylor , Gunild Keetman and George Tipton , too ; it's one of the best debuts of the 70's .

I swear that Jane Leeves from Frasier was on this show but I could be wrong because I don't see her name anywhere here . Like so many sitcoms of the 1980s , this show was somewhat mediocre for network but had a syndicated audience . I remember those days of syndication when you watched independent sitcoms like Throb and not infomercials . Sadly , they don't make many syndicated programs like they used too . Everybody has a network for them . But I do remember a time when syndicated television thrived and shows like Throb thrived or lasted longer than a few episodes . Sitcoms need time to develop and the networks don't give that time anymore and they don't want that audience neither .

Text2: Fortunately the rest of the film is good enough to make up for it . The opening shows Carlito Brigante , former criminal , being hauled away in a stretcher , covered in blood after being shot . Well , now I know how the film ends . The suspense of the film's climax is ruined if we immediately know his fate . Duh ! Pacino ( surely more deserving of an Academy Award here than he was for his overrated performance in Scent of a Woman ) narrates us through the last week or so of Carlito Brigante's life as he is let out of jail after five years out of thirty for mitigates circumstances coming to light . Determined to go straight , Carlito shrugs off all advances from crooks old and new but is eventually drawn back into a quagmire of trouble by his cokehead lawyer ( Sean Penn dressed up as Disco Stu from The Simpsons , who also deserved to take home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar ) The 145 minute running time passes in a breeze and there's loads of interesting story developments to keep you hooked . But DePalma's sterile widescreen photography and sets reek of the crassness of Scarface . This film is miles ahead of that junk ( but let's not get into a debate about that ) though I do think that a more vivid production design and cinematography and slicker editing would have stopped the film from looking so bland . I don't think DePalma is a great director but I do enjoy Carlito's Way , The Untouchables and Snake Eyes .

Morlant comes back to life as a hideously disfigured murderous ghoul after someone steals the jewel from his tomb . Director T . Hayes Hunter relates the eventful story at a constant zippy pace , does an expert job of creating a beautifully eerie atmosphere in the first half of the picture , and adroitly blends elements of both horror and humor into a hugely enjoyable mix . The enthusiastic acting by the tip-top cast qualifies as another substantial asset : Cedric Hardwicke as conniving , treacherous lawyer Broughton , Ernest Thesiger as Morlant's disloyal servant Laing , Anthony Bushell as Morlant's irate nephew Ralph , Dorothy Hyson as Morlant's sweet , fiery niece Betty Harlow , Kathleen Harrison as Betty's dotty friend Kaney , Sir Ralph Richardson in his film debut as jolly priest Nigel Hartley , and Harold Huth as crazed Arab zealot Aga Ben Dragore . Kudos are also in order for Gunther Krampf's stunning black and white cinematography ; the spooky shots of fog-shrouded nighttime London streets are simply exquisite . The roaring , dramatic score by Louis Levy and Rupert Downing likewise hits the stirring spot . My sole complaint is that Karloff isn't in the film enough : Although prominently featured at the start , dear Boris alas remains off-screen for much of the action in the middle of the movie , but fortunately comes back with a ferocious vengeance for the rousing incendiary conclusion . That minor criticism aside , this feature overall rates as a good deal of vintage 30's golden oldie horror fun .

Text2: A couple of weeks ago I had a get together with a bunch of Matt Johnson ( Aka The The ) fans down in London and a couple of people I'd met there , namely Duncan and Ange , had like me attended film school . As in these type of situations the topic of conversation soon got round to lamenting the demise of the British film industry . It may sound bitter but we all agreed that the reason was because the industry in this country is crippled by nepotism with people getting their movies financed simply because they know the right people , not because they have any obvious talent MAD COWS is a case in point . Apparently it's based on a novel by Australian Kathy Lette which probably explains how her husband Geoffry Robertson managed to get a walk on part in this movie . Robertson isn't a professional actor which means a member of Equity has been deprived of an income . Actually at least one other actor has also been deprived since Mohamed Al Fayed the owner of Harrods also appears in a walk on part . As for the actors who have paid their dues to Equity I wasn't impressed . Anna Friel spends the movie with an entirely unconvincing Aussie accent while Joanna Lumley is abysmal since she recreates her role as Patsy Stone from ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS The supporting cast I will reserve judgement on because I've a feeling that the director Sara Sugarman is more to blame than the actors themselves . A case in point is an interrogation by a detective who has arrested the heroine for stealing a packet of frozen peas ( A pathetic plot twist ? Glad you agree with me ) and my gut instinct is that the scene was hopelessly unfunny to begin with but instead of the director beating the screenwriter to death with a limp script Ms Sugarman has told the actor in question to put on a funny speech impediment and other clown mannerisms . No doubt the cast have nothing but kind words about working with Sara Sugerman but you don't make a movie to enjoy yourself - You make a movie to let the audience enjoy themself and there's no enjoyment here as we have to endure silly performances , MTV style direction in a very plot less and episodic story that is a kick in the guts to anyone who has struggled to make it in the movie business in this country But at least MAD COWS proves once and for all that it's not what you know in the British movie industry - It's who you know","{""output"": ""NO""}"
1012,"Text1: I've handled quite a few reels of nitrate-stock film from the days of silent movies and the early talkies . On more than one occasion , I've encountered a silent film from which a sequence was deliberately cut out . Unless this was an intertitle , the missing footage almost invariably turns out to have been an insert shot of a handwritten note , a typed letter or a newspaper article . In silent-movie days , in order to exhibit films in foreign-language markets , the original insert shot of a piece of text had to be removed , a substitute ( in the new language ) made and photographed , and then sufficient footage of the new image spliced into the print . Thus , for instance , we now have Lon Chaney's silent film ' The Unknown ' ( copied from a French print ) missing the original shot of Chaney's blackmail letter , and Laurel and Hardy's silent short ' Duck Soup ' ( copied from a French-language print found in Belgium ) missing the original newspaper article about the forest-fires . In both of these cases ( and many more recovered silent movies ) , a new image had to be constructed , shot , and edited into the film for modern reissue . I screened the Library of Congress print of ' The Little Darling ' : an acetate dupe made from a paper print . For some reason , the paper print - - especially made for copyright registry in the Library of Congress - - is missing the shot of the letter which triggers the plot of this brief film ; without the text of that letter , all that follows is confusing . Fortunately , I've also seen ( in Europe ) a print which includes several feet of an insert shot : a French-language version of the letter that's missing from the Library of Congress print , so I understood the plot which follows it . IMDb's synopsis of this movie ( probably from a vintage film exhibitor's catalogue ) is accurate . A boarding-house landlady receives a letter from her cousin ( that's the one we're missing ) , which announces that the cousin is sending her "" little darling "" to visit the landlady , arriving on this afternoon's train . ( At least , this is the text of the French version . ) The boarding-house's many bachelors - - all of them believing the "" little darling "" to be a child , and all of them amazingly paternal - - run out and buy various toys and a pram for the new arrival . They carry all this lot to the railway station . Off the train steps the "" little darling "" : a very pretty Mary Pickford , who's 17 years old and nobody's baby . Collapse of several stout parties . Mack Sennett is briefly glimpsed in this crude comedy as one of the burlier bachelors , clutching a jumping-jack toy . Before founding the Keystone studio in Edendale , Sennett had served as D . W . Griffith's apprentice at Biograph in New York City , and Sennett often paid tribute to his mentor . Pickford's sister Lottie is glimpsed here in the shop sequence . I was annoyed that several of the actors in ' The Little Darling ' perform directly to the camera , emoting in precisely that exaggerated style which has given silent-film acting a bad name . I'll rate this quickie just .

Text2: ' Air Hawks ' is a rousing good adventure story , starring Ralph Bellamy in one of his rare outings as a two-fisted action hero . ( Bellamy was more typically cast in romantic comedies , as the guy who lost the girl to a better man . ) Here , he plays a former Army pilot who sets up his own low-budget air-courier service . Bellamy hopes to get a lucrative federal contract , flying bags of mail cross-country . A previous air service lost the contract because their ' planes kept mysteriously crashing . Veteran movie villain Douglass Dumbrille is in this movie , cast as a ' respectable businessman ' , so it's obvious who's behind the air crashes . . . and that's not a spoiler . The action cuts back and forth between Bellamy's good-guy flyboys and Dumbrille's secret hideout , so the audience know the reason for those ' plane crashes well ahead of Bellamy . Hoping to get the mail contract for himself , Dumbrille has engaged the services of an eccentric professor named Schulter . . . who has invented an ' electrical ray ' : a gigantic unwieldy device that he points into the air , which conveniently bollixes any electrical motor that passes overhead . I would have thought that most 1930s aircraft were powered primarily by internal combustion , with electricity being only secondary . But Schulter's gizmo works a treat , and pretty soon the pretty aeroplanes are dropping like stones . Professor Schulter ( a very brief role ) is played by Edward Van Sloan , who famously played the ethically-responsible scientist in several monster movies , so it's very interesting to see him here as a scientist who uses his knowledge for evil purposes . The presence of Schulter's electrical ray makes ' Air Hawks ' technically a science-fiction movie , but the whole film has the feel of a Saturday-morning adventure serial , with the emphasis on thrills rather than gadgetry . The most interesting name in this cast list is that of Wiley Post , who is now remembered only as the pilot in the fatal ' plane crash that killed Will Rogers . ( Matters were not helped by the Broadway musical ' The Will Rogers Follies ' , which reduced Wiley Post's entire life to a cheap plot device . ) It's unfortunate that Post is so poorly remembered . In the 1930s , most Americans knew of Post for his record-setting exploits as a pioneer of high-altitude flight . He invented a pressure suit designed to keep an aviator alive at high altitudes . Post was also the first pilot to fly around the Earth , and the first person to experience jet lag . Many 1930s films ( especially those made at Warner Bros ) featured a useful cinematic device , in which brief clips of the principal actors are shown during the opening credits , with the actors ' names ( and the names of their roles in the film ) superimposed on these images . This very helpful practice enabled filmgoers to match an actor's name to a face . That device is used in the opening credits of ' Air Hawks ' , with Wiley Post prominently listed as playing himself . After that brief clip , however , we see no more of the great aviator until more than halfway through this film , when Wiley Post ambles onto the screen very briefly to offer a few words of encouragement to Bellamy's beleaguered pilot . It's clear that the filmmakers worship Post , and rightly so . Except for newsreel footage , ' Air Hawks ' is Wiley Post's only film appearance , so it's regrettable that his participation is so brief . ( Maybe he had to catch a flight . ) I also enjoyed a brief appearance by Elise Cavanna , the tall and gawky ( yet attractive ) comic actress who performed so memorably in a couple of WC Fields movies at this time . ' Air Hawks ' is a delight from start to finish , one of those movies that nostalgia enthusiasts talk about when they say that Hollywood "" doesn't make ' em like that any more "" .

1013,"Text1: Ah , Grindhouse movies , loaded for bear with the sickest garbage and clichéd to hell ; hell , by the way , not to be taken for granted . The films and trailers presented are half-vomitoriums and half-absurd white-knuckle thrill-rides , where genre is taken apart like scissors on a stretch-Armstrong doll with all of the gooey effluence gushing away on the screen . And unlike some who've already seen the film , I'm not totally certain yet ( least on a first-viewing ) of which feature I liked / responded to more . They're both imperfect movies , but naturally so , and there's stuff in both that can be criticized for ( i . e . Planet Terror goes too far and has dialog written as if by a guy in prison , and Death Proof is maybe too much like a Tarantino movie to really squeeze into the grindhouse mold ) . Yet on the terms that the filmmakers go for , they totally accomplish ten-fold . It's also just an extreme load of fun and excitement , with the kind of disturbing material that is unequivocally , hysterically funny . Planet Terror is , in some ways , an even more fed up horror-show circus of violence and explosions and massive-gun-fire / death-counts and catch phrases than From Dusk Till Dawn was . It certainly marks another high-point for Rodriguez as someone who takes precedence for shocks and wild tricks of the visual medium than "" interesting "" dialog . In this case , Planet Terror revels in the cut-outs from past low-grade genre drek , and it works terrifically in the realm of the premise : noxious gas unleashed on a small town that sparks up "" infected "" people by the dozens-to-later-hundreds of zombie-esquire folk after a stripper , a rogue , law-enforcement folk , doctors , and a couple of babysitter sisters . It's almost a case for how some things - like WRETCHED violence and gore and multiple casualties and excess to a T - won't get an NC-17 . Rodriguez also wisely uses two courses of action . First is to make all of these vicious special fx all the more gleeful in the debauchery in its humor - not just the popping sores on the faces , or various limbs affected , but the "" did they actually do that "" moments , ( Tarantino's genital area , the wrists of McGraw's doctor daughter ) , and to wonderfully set-up the look of the Grindhouse picture , where scratches are common as hell , a reel will go missing once in a while ( ironically right during or before a hot sex scene ) , and almost tearing at the seams . This and Machete , his much-anticipated vehicle for the great character actor Danny Trejo , demonstrate Rodriguez's real gifts , and the actors he puts on display ( from Cheech to Michael Biehn to surprisingly Rosa McGowan ) are completely , hilariously unconscious of the recklessness of schlock like this . In very short , a gas from start to finish , with a nice touch of Carpenter-music ( John I mean ) . In the middle of the two films , by the way , are at least three whacked-out trailers as sort of special guests of Rodriguez and Tarantino's . Far more funnier and audaciously outrageous than the "" normal "" trailers , where Zombie's Werewolves of the SS giving Nicolas Cage his finest moment in film in many years , Wright's DON'T ! a fantastic play on a cliché-by-title , and Thanksgiving being maybe the best , most shameless work Eli Roth has done yet ( where else am I going to see a turkey get . . . well , maybe I've already said too much , aside from the greatest line ever : "" White meat or dark meat , they'll both be carved ! "" ) . There's the movie-geek in all of us that would wish that all of these movie will someday be made into features , though part of the charm , if one could describe , is that they won't . Tarantino , meanwhile , has something of a totally different route to go on here , which is all relative : Rodriguez , after all , is the first part of a double-billing , and as such makes his with much greater abandon for standards of good taste or common sense , yet is also not completely as strong because of its sort of badness ( albeit goodness too ) . Tarantino is , more appropriately , the second half and not-quite main attraction , even if his might seem like more of a tame and conventional effort when compared to Planet Terror and the incredible trailers . It's an homage to the wild road-chase movies of the early 70s , where Vanishing Point gets a huge nod and Kurt Russell gets the brightest note to a career now overloaded with kids movies . His character , Stuntman Mike , is a wickedly fun masochist who's got attitude by leaps and bounds , and quite the bad-ass car . He doesn't contend with some ladies from the stunt-department of a movie-set , however , where a cat-and-mouse game ensues . And a damn fine game indeed ; the car chases in Death Proof should maybe even appeal to those who usually don't take to car chases too highly , namely because Tarantino's got a satirist's eye always at work somehow in the material . The danger comes when it leans towards being talky , as QT tends to do , and one shot in a diner brings Reservoir Dogs very much into mind . But it's also of interest that Tarantino has actually made a very solid action thriller , one that goes one or two steps further than the common road-movie of the old times went , with the craziness there and sort of complimenting Tarantino's clever direction , tough women , and good old rock & roll . So gear up in your dirty seat , if you can find one , with a bunch of friends in a crowded theater , and make sure not to miss the little animated intros to the "" parental advisory "" warning before each movie . It's the movie ' event ' of the year , particularly for fans of unrepentant action and gruesome carnage .

Text2: Kevin Smith's Mallrats is quite an amusing picture . Some might go as far to say as it is not as high to standards as his last pictures ( and sadly I slightly agree ) , but that still doesn't matter with Smith at the helm . In fact , he can be better at writer / director / Silent Bob than any other one in America when he tries hard enough . The film circles on 2 slackers at a mall where they hang out ( Jay and Silent Bob also preside with Jedi powers ) who want to get their girlfriends back after they dumped them . Their escapades in one day is similar to Clerks without the black and white , but by no means is it better than Clerks . I wish it was , but it doesn't grab you as much as Clerks did . Still , Mallrats is a cool , hilarious comedy that is great for parties , or sick days .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
1014,"Text1: Burnt Offerings starts as Ben Rolf ( Oliver Reed ) , his wife Marion ( Karen Black ) & their young son David ( Lee Montgomery ) decide the chance to rent a huge mansion for the summer for a paltry $900 is too good to turn down , the only condition set by current owner's Roz ( Eileen Heckart ) & her brother Arnold Allardyce ( Burgess Meredith ) is that they feed their mother who lives in a room upstairs which the Rolf's agree to . They move in together with their aunt Elizabeth ( Bette Davis ) & Marion starts to clean the place up , Ben settles down to do some work & David explores the house . However it's not long before they strange things start to happen , their personalities start to change , they begin to argue & grow apart , near fatal accidents happen & Marion becomes obsessed with the house in a way that threatens their very lives . . . Co-written , produced & directed by Dan Curtis I have to say that I thought Burnt Offerings was one of the most boring films I've seen in a long time , I mean scenes of people walking around a big house doing nothing in particular just becomes boring after almost 2 straight hours of it . The script by Curtis & William F . Nolan was based on a novel of the same name by Robert Marasco , even though you may automatically think Burnt Offerings is a haunted house flick it isn't really in the sense that there's no ghosts & the major plot point which takes forever to get to is that the house regenerates itself through death & violent acts committed by it's inhabitants which in itself isn't a bad idea I suppose but the film is so slow & boring I lost almost all interest in it before the extremely stupid so-called twist ending which I figured out about halfway through . In fact the ending doesn't really sit that well with the main story & in the end it's just a bit of a mess that goes nowhere very slowly . There are only four character's in it , the Rolf family themselves & none of them are particularly likable , the dialogue is alright but forgettable & for a film that lasts 110 minutes not that much actually happens , or at least it didn't feel like it . Director Curtis is better known as a producer & director of TV show's , in fact Burnt Offerings was his only theatrical feature film & it show's with so much padding it's untrue . The film also looks like a TV show with fairly standard cinematography & a bland uninspiring look to it . This is a debatable point but I didn't think Burnt Offerings was scary at all & had zero atmosphere . The title Burnt Offerings means little as nothing or no-one is burnt although the Rolf family being left to the house's mercy by the Allardyce's could be described as a sacrificial offering . Technically the film is OK but bland & dull which is explained by director Curtis ' TV background . Filmed at Dunsmuir House & Gardens in Oakland in California & it makes a nice enough location although it gets repetitive . The acting isn't great , the kid is annoying , Reed isn't interested & Black is just awful , apparently she was 4 months pregnant when she shot this . Burnt Offerings has a few nice ideas but they are lost in a long , boring , tedious & frankly repetitive film that goes nowhere & takes nearly 2 hours to get there . Not recommended unless you suffer from insomnia .

Text2: Nosferatu a Venezia , or Vampire in Venice as it's more commonly known as to English speaking audiences , starts with the arrival of Professor Paris Catalano ( Christopher Plummer ) in the beautiful European city of Venice . Professor Catalano has dedicated his whole life to the study of Nosferatu ( do you think that pays well ? ) who disappeared in Venice during 1786 , he has received a letter from Helietta Canins ( Barbara De Rossi ) who claims that a coffin in her basement contains the body of Nosferatu ( Klaus Kinski ) . Catalano checks it out but disagrees , to try & prove her point ( I think ) Helietta organises a séance & hires a medium ( Clara Colosimo ) to try & contact Nosferatu . It turns out Calatano was right & Nosferatu isn't in Helietta's basement but the séance does raise Nosferatu from his 200 year sleep & after consulting with a gypsy ( ! ) Nosferatu heads off in search of those who summoned him . Oh , & to add to the excitement he also has a few nice boat rides down various Venice canal's . . . This Italian production was written , produced & in part directed by Augusto Caminito & is a loose sequel to Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyr ( 1979 ) although the actual connection with that film is nothing more than Kinski reprising his role as Nosferatu & even then he looks completely different in each film . The script by Caminito is a bit on the dull side , takes itself very seriously & is an absolute mess . I would imagine that the various reported production problems were the reason , nothing in the film makes any real sense & things , people , sub-plots & unnecessary flashbacks just come & go with little regard for narrative cohesion . There are a few odd flashbacks , Donald Pleasence's character Don Alvise just rambles on about God for a few scenes before he is completely dropped , why would Professor Catalano spend his entire life studying Nosferatu & when he finally finds him decides to commit suicide , what was in the coffin , why did half it's face glow red & then turn to dust & what the hell are all those gypsies & that woman's magic crystal ball all about ? The whole film feels fractured & that various different people with opposing ideas & aims worked on it . Having said that it's watchable & just about strange enough to maintain ones interest plus the ironic ending where Nosferatu who is tired of eternal life & wants to die is hunted by some Vampire hunters who actually kill Helietta instead & since Nosferatu needs the unconditional love of a virgin to die the Vampire hunters have in fact achieved the opposite of what they wanted to do . Right , now lets get this straight shall we . Apparently producer Caminito hired Maurizio Lucidi as director & he even shot a few scenes but Caminito fired him . Caminito then hired Pasquale Squitieri to write & direct , however his screenplay was apparently too expensive to shoot so he was sacked as well . Caminito then hired a third director Mario Caiano , unfortunately on his first day Kinski got into a ' violent argument ' with Caiano & he too left the director's chair . Caminito then decided to just direct the thing himself but had no experience so he was helped by his assistant Luigi Cozzi , but it doesn't end there folks because it is also reported that Kinski shot a fair amount of the film himself . The saying ' too many cooks spoil the broth ' comes to mind & I think it's a perfect phrase to describe Nosferatu a Venezia . The film is undoubtedly stylish & has some great scenes but they're lost within the mess of a story . Forget about any gore , a bit of blood & a few people fall on some spiked railings , that's it . There's some nudity as well if that's your thing . Technically the film is very good with some great costumes , sets & Venice itself makes for an unusual location . It has nice cinematography & music , it's just a shame the film had so many behind-the-camera problems . The acting was OK although am I the only one who thinks Kinski looks terrible in this ? He looks like Peter Stringfellow on a bad day ! Nosferatu a Venezia was a disappointment , if the story had been stronger this could have been a decent sequel , as it is it's a curious mess both in front of & behind-the-camera . Could have been so much more , watch Nosferatu the Vampyr again instead .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

1016,"Text1: One thing that I have been less than impressed with over the last few years is the quality of films being pumped out of modern day Asia . While the continent has made some very nice films in the past ( Onibaba , Kaidan etc ) , the recent crop is dull . Samey , boring films ; all handling the same topics and I for one am bored stiff with them . I was surprised , then , when I heard that A Tale of Two Sisters was a cut above the rest of the pack ; but I really should have known better . As a new thing that I'm not impressed with , is this film . I can see why people would say it's better than the likes of Ringu and Dark Water - it's atmosphere is thicker and far more foreboding , and it's got a lot more style - but it still falls down on the principal , most important element of any film ; and that's the story . Frankly , the plot is dull and samey , and adding to it's woe is the fact that it's convoluted and complicated ; owing much to the way that it's told . I have no problem with films that demand the viewer to pay attention to what is going on - but if you're going to make a film complicated , at least make it interesting enough so that I CARE what's going on . It annoys me how a foreign film can be released and met with praise despite not having anything great about it . Aside from the atmosphere ( which still isn't ' great ' ) , this film doesn't have any quality that puts it ahead of the rest of the films it imitates . The way that the plot plays out is about as gripping as socks on a laminated floor . It starts out as a family drama , some Ringu style camera angles are thrown in with a ghost that looks surprisingly like that one that comes out of the telly in said film , then we go back to family drama , there's a brown sack like the one in Audition , then it ends . The plot really just made me beg for it to end , as despite trying my best to connect and even like the film , I couldn't and as the movie jumps from one plot point to another ; I just couldn't care less . If you like Asian horror , you'll probably like this one too as it really is just more of the same , but really I recommend checking out some other niches of the genre like the stuff coming out of Europe or even the US indie scene rather than Asia . From this day forward , recent Asian horror movies are banned from my television screen , as they just aren't worth watching .

Text2: Well , I wasn't expecting anything more than a ' fun B-movie thriller ' from Invasion of the Bee Girls , and I didn't get anything more . I can certainly think of more fun ways to spend ninety minutes of my time too , but on the plus side - as this sort of film goes , this one isn't a terrible example . Insects are some of Earth's most interesting creatures , and this film sets itself apart from many other flicks handling similar topics as it actually takes some time to make that point . . . not everything the film professes is true ( for example , the female praying mantis will only eat her mate if she is hungry ) , but you can't expect a proper lesson on the natural world from a B-movie thriller . The insects that the film focuses on , unsurprisingly , are bees , and we focus on the results of experiments conducted by Dr . Susan Harris , as a number of men are found dead - apparently from excessive exertion during sex ( hey , there's worse ways to die ! ) . The majority of the film is actually rather dull , however , and while some attempt is made at fusing insect life cycles with the human one - the idea behind the plot certainly could have been given a better story to work with . Overall , I can't really recommend Invasion of the Bee Girls - it's not as outlandish as the title suggests it is , nor is it as ' fun ' as you would expect ; but if you do end up watching this , it has to be said that you could do worse .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Some exceptional backgrounds and very good animation here and also fairly well-developed characters ( not usually a hallmark of Iwerks studio ) make this an entertaining short . The farmer looks a bit like Al Falfa from Terrytoons , but character design wasn't a long suit for the studio either . They tended to draw things pretty much the same over and over . They may have had five or six basic variations on kids and used them interchangeably . The animals come off better than the humans do .

Text2: I think I liked Child's Play 2 more than most people , given the reviews that I've read and the movie's low voter rating on the IMDb . A cute kid's doll is once again the unlikely home of Charles Lee Ray , notorious serial killer , again feeding off of the surrealism created by seeing a kid's doll screw it's face into expressions of the purest rage and spouting all manner of profanities . By now , Ray is becoming more and more desperate to get out of the body of the doll , because as we were informed in the first film , if he spends too much time in that body he'll gradually become more and more human until one day he'll be stuck in it forever . Needless to say , Ray's a lot more interested in starting life over as a 6-year-old ( and who wouldn't ? ) rather than spending the rest of his life as a plastic doll . Although , given that he becomes more human the longer he is in that body , how human will he eventually become ? Will he ever reach full human-hood ? My guess is that he'll gradually approach being a real human being in a sort of half life , where he gets closer and closer and closer but never actually gets there , kind of like computer generated actors . There is currently much talk about how close computers can ever get to animating convincingly real people into the movies , and the leading theory seems to be something akin to my theory of Chucky turning human . He'll always get closer but he'll never get all the way there . At any rate , Andy's mother has landed in a mental institution and Andy has been taken in by a foster family with appropriate mental vacuity to be a horror movie surrogate family . When Andy becomes frightened and runs through the house , his foster father grabs him and says , ' Rule # 1 , no running in the house ! ' OK , ' dad , ' but not even when I open a closet and find myself confronted by the doll that landed my mom in the nuthouse and almost cost me my life and my very soul ? My God , man , what the hell is this guy doing with a Good Guys doll in the house in the first place ? It's difficult enough trying to figure out why it's even there WITHOUT having to watch this mental giant grab Andy by the arm and ask him what on earth is the matter . There are some funny moments in the film , such as when Chucky smashes the head of the innocent Good Guys doll , buries it , and takes its place in the house , and my favorite , when Chucky is later addressed by a doting adult , Chucky responds by saying in his cute doll voice , ' Hi ! I'm ? . Tommy ! ' The stockholders in the Play Pal corporation are distressed over the suffering that the company has endured due to the negative publicity of the events of the first movie provide the premise for the movie's rather impressive finale . In order to generate a more positive image for the company and the doll , they have decided to reintroduce it into the market . The original Chucky doll was collected by the company and examined by toy-makers , who decided that there really was nothing truly wrong with it , it was not really a demon-possessed toy , so they decided to melt it down and remake it . Why they didn't just throw it away I'm not really sure , but who cares . Waste not , want not , I guess . At any rate , Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body ( too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another ) , and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul . I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something , but you'll remember in the first movie , the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll . Jarrett Friend , writing for HorrorWatch , made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation , but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls , since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie . This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality ; my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big . Nevertheless , even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story , Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels , kind of like Psycho II , which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence . I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2 , but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting , if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape . There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film , not including , however , the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost , making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so . A bit trite , but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film , which is the final scene , one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie . Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene . I do , however , think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got . I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits .

1021,"Text1: I wonder why I missed the first two movies of the franchise , given that I'm a fan of gore ( the bloodier the merrier ) . But you need not have watched the first two movies in order to enjoy Final Destination 3 , as it's pretty much a stand-alone movie utilizing the same premise . Which is when someone actually somehow foresees the future , where something tragically fatal will happen to him / her . They pull out from the situation , and following along ( whether they like it or not ) are a few others . The tragedy happens , and they all escape death . Death is naturally upset , and continues to kill off the characters who were supposed to die . But of course , if you can cheat death again , you're off the hook . You know you're in for a good , satisfactory ride when the opening credits are stuffed with relative unknowns , meaning they are the fodder who will die in ways imagined by the writer . Co-writer and director James Wong , who was involved in the original movie , returns to extend his vision of the franchise . There are numerous references to the earlier movies , like the number 180 which pops up , and also to serve as research material for the characters in FD3 ( hard to imagine that the first movie was SIX years ago ! ) . Nifty special effects are also the hallmark of the FD movies , which bring to life the filmmaker's sadistic vision of deaths in various ways from being fried alive to huge objects becoming giant human-swatters . The movie also sticks to the usual slasher / horror conventions , of knowing that bimbos will die in the most idiotic way ever . Don't go looking for logic in the elaborate setup before character deaths - it's like every implausible element that will impact or contribute towards someone's death , will be looked into . The coincidence might make you shake your head at the sheer audacity of it all , but then , if Death's looking for you , all angles must be covered , and you must die . Like right now . In a fashionably bloody manner to boot , as if to punish you for having cheated initially . Being rated NC-16 here however , meant that certain scenes had to be cut . Strangely , suggestive scenes like a character licking the boobs of a nude woman keychain , and the bimbos stripping down to their birthday suits , get the snip . But the glorious bloodbath ( save one ) get shown uncut . As the show progresses , you get to see more . So I guess if the movie is rated for violence and gore , most nudity will get cut off , and probably vice versa ? One wonders . Does this movie scream sequel again ? Maybe , if the filmmakers can come up with some more creative ways to die , in bloody good fashion , then perhaps the franchise would probably continue . If you're really hard up and stayed until the end , you'll just be rewarded with a maniacal laughter .

Text2: Then again , it's a comedy , and the whole intention of Tong was to try and emulate the classical 80s comedies from Hong Kong , especially those Stephen Chow "" mo lei tau "" ( nonsensical ) movies , which Tong confessed this evening to being probably his # 1 fan in Singapore . Unfortunately those movies are in a class of its own , and the actors in MiW are certainly not in the same league too . But you can't fault Tong for trying , as MiW was more like a shotgun firing its rounds - some pellets hit the mark , while some others totally miss the target . Technically , Tong has shown that he understood the elements of suspense - the prologue showed that he is more than capable to helm another horror movie though he overdid this bit to achieve some comedic effect , a subtle prod on those horror movies with extremely closeups of facial expressions , especially that of Asian horror favourite - the widening eyeball . Alas , in treading onto comedy in almost Jack Neo fashion , MiW too felt like little skits pieced together to make a feature length film . And Neo's style of meshing songs into the narrative , became no less than 3 musical pieces popping up as music videos , complete with sing along lyrics , karaoke style . But I like these songs - they are fun , at times nonsensical , and are in dialect with no English subtitles , which to some , might have been lost in translation ( ahem I'm multi-lingual , so no problem lah ) . The music comes courtesy of Joe Ng ( Mee Pok Man ) , and the sound effects and design is probably one of the best in a local movie , especially since it was relied on heavily to deliver those cartoonish effects with aplomb , and you definitely must keep your ears peeled to appreciate this . One such scene involves Benjamin Heng , who has appeared in Kelvin Tong movies , and whose character here , if I were to romanticize it further , could have seemed like a ( logical though more fantastical since it's in the spiritual realm ) continuation of the one in Eating Air , as they share similar mannerisms , or could actually seem more of a spoof of his earlier Ah-Beng gangster character . Heng has a supporting role here though . The other main characters are Shaun Chen as Ah Boon , an ex-national reserve badminton player , Alice Lim as Madam Wong , an elderly lady , Ling Lee as Wan Yi , a lady who choked to death , and the Hip Hop duo of err Hip ( Xavier Teo ) and Hop ( Ben Yeung ) , whom I swear are more irritating as time goes by , until they break into song and dance in those music videos . They are all ghostly pals living in an unused HDB apartment unit , and whine for the most parts about how difficult life is for a ghost in Singapore . Not to forget , a bit part for Sunny the cameraman , another ghostly pal who's filming the chronicles of these friends . No prizes for acting skills over here , as Shaun Chen does look a little wooden , Xavier and Ben like I mentioned , and chewing up too much screen with their over the top performances , and Ling Lee , well I'm not sure why , but certain angles did make her look rather unappealing . Maybe they are playing to their one-dimensional characters , but the character which stole the show , hands down , is the gambler-contractor . Now he IS the star of MiW with his perfect delivery of some of the best lines and situations in the movie . David Aw had a bit role in the movie as an instigator of change , and he got that role as a result of a MiW Talent Search Contest , which I thought didn't require much talent actually , given the screen time . The narrative played out chapter-like , each self contained as an answer to commonly asked ghostly questions , which is why it resembled skits , though it does have a romantic thread that slowly runs and gets developed in the 2nd half of the movie . In true local movie fashion , it used multiple languages again to highlight our multi-lingual society , though some might find fault with its politically incorrect racist jokes and stereotyping ( OK so I am now feeling guilty at laughing out loud at these ) . Some of the other jokes might seem a bit too localized for them to be effective to a more international audience , but I guess the sight gags ( at times quite juvenile ) will always be able to transcend language barriers . An irk I had though , there were noticeable typos in the English subtitles . Probably next time I can proofread for anyone out there ! With a title like that ( the original Chinese title of "" Ghost ah ! Ghost ah ! "" ) , this film doesn't take itself seriously , and neither should you . Just kick back and relax , enjoy some of the pluses this movie has to offer , wince at the minuses , and remember , it's "" mo lei tau "" no-brainer entertainment , so don't fret too much over it .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Zombie is trying to make the audience feel empathy for Myers , but it's such sacrilege to the Original , which in that , Myers is just credited as ' the shape ' , now how can someone feel empathy for a shape . as usual with a movie directed by Zombie , it's way over the top with profanity and is very , very loud , but it's the girls that myers stalk that have foul language , and were basically foul , so you were not very shocked when he killed who he did ( stereotypical horror movie deaths ) on the plus side McDowell does deliver a good performance as loomis and for the horror Buffs their are some quirky cameos from Kier , Foree , and Dourif . and the original soundtrack is used to good effect . it's such a shame that Zombie has made a bad film as the trailers made it look so promising , and it could have made up for years of bad Haloween sequels ( H2O not counted ) . but he broke the big role of Myers justification of his early films , coming from a loveless family , which makes one of the most famous horror icons , just not very scary . more of a trick than a treat .

Upon returning home , Christine was distressed to discover that Walter was nowhere to be found . Over the course of the following months , the desperate mother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless . Yet just when it seemed that all hope was lost , a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear out of thin air . Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the press , Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that he is not her son . As much as Christine would like to accept the fact that her son has been returned to her , she cannot accept the injustice being pushed upon her and continues to challenge the Prohibition-era Los Angeles police force at every turn . As a result , Christine is slandered by the powers that be , and painted as an unfit mother .

1023,"Text1: John Payne's first feature film western was El Paso in 1949 , but earlier on when he was under contract to Warner Brothers he did this Vitagraph Short about a Wild West Show that comes to a Ruritanian type kingdom in the Balkans . Young king Scotty Beckett is real enthusiastic about it , especially after Payne saves his life after he falls over from the royal balcony . But Payne has to keep doing it because some of the king's adult counselors are planning a coup d'etat . Payne and sidekick Cliff Edwards foil the plans of plotters Stuart Holmes and Boyd Irwin . The film is a cut down version of the Ken Maynard feature film Royal Rider and between all that life saving , several musical numbers get thrown into the bargain . I'm betting that Jack Warner was trying out young contract player Payne to see if he might make a passable singing cowboy . In any event within two years Payne was doing A musicals at 20th Century Fox with Alice Faye , Betty Grable , and Sonja Henie . And when he got around to westerns again , he sung not a note .

Text2: At the top of the list of Don Ameche's best films , in that first five , Heaven Can Wait is always listed . As a film with that inimitable Ernest Lubitsch touch , how could it miss ? The very dapper an elegant Mr . Henry Van Cleave has arrived at the entrance to the underworld where he feels given the risqué life he's led on earth , he feels he belongs . To convince the Prince of Darkness , Laird Cregar , that he should be his guest for eternity . And he tells him his life story to prove his case . We see Don Ameche at the various stages of his life during this film and the picture we get of him is a very decent man , but one who could not resist a pretty face or a pretty ankle , depending on which order he noticed them . Nevertheless he does meet the girl of his dreams , Gene Tierney , and while she kept him on the straight and narrow , it wasn't without a look here and there to the side . Some of Hollywood's favorite character actors show up in this film which is one of the reasons it's such a favorite . It's hard to pick from a cast that includes Signe Hasso , Spring Byington , Marjorie Main , Louis Calhern , Eugene Palette , Allyn Joslyn , and Charles Coburn any particular favorite . But I'd have to say my favorite is Laird Cregar . There has never been a more cultivated or civilized Satan on the screen before or since . Cregar's performance more than anything else is symbolic of the Lubitsch touch . Heaven Can Wait is an interesting commentary on our system of morals . Don Ameche's character is absolutely sure he's going to hell and if you listened to fundamentalist ministers he sure would be . Apparently for Laird Cregar's place though , if you spread some happiness in life you certainly don't qualify for admission . An interesting criteria , don't you think . Don Ameche is charming , Gene Tierney is beautiful , the script is witty and bright , the direction faultless . Can't do better than that .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
1024,"Text1: Well , horror combined with western always sounds like an interesting and potentially effective combination to me but I'm still waiting for the perfect movie that is able to combine the two genres effectively and uses the best from both genres . It's the type of horror movie that implies more than that it actually shows . The danger of overdoing this is that it becomes totally ineffective after a while . This also happens with this movie . The movie also isn't being helped much by all of its other elements though . It's a very slow paced movie , that doesn't develop either its story or characters well enough . The story is kept very simple . Too simple . It relies purely on its main concept on a bunch of confederate soldier outlaws taking shelter in an old deserted house in the middle of nowhere , after they robbed the bank in a nearby town . Of course strange things start to happen in the house and people start to die under unusual circumstances , one by one . There isn't much else to the story really and the movie doesn't use any of its mystery , to strengthen its horror . It relies more on its dark atmosphere and slow pace but this rather makes the movie dull and uninteresting than original , scary and / or exciting really . The movie also keeps repeating itself too much with its story and scare moments . Also in the end the story , especially concerning its why's and how's are being left unanswered , which will leave you with an unsatisfying impression afterward . In these days of modern horror this movie simply doesn't stand out well enough . It doesn't come up with anything new and original and even as a standard generic movie this movie is too lacking to leave a significant enough impression . Yeah well , it's a good looking movie , that certainly doesn't have a cheap look over it , despite its low budget . It has a good , though formulaic , visual horror style . It's good looking with its effects , make-up and gore as well , though I need to say that the movie is unnecessary gory , at the totally wrong moments ( for example during the bank robbery ) . You also just never care enough about any of the characters within the movie , also since basically each of them are murdering thieves , that are not to be trusted in any way . The potentially best and most interesting characters of the movie are getting killed off at first , which is very typical . The movie does feature some good and also quite well known actors ( Henry Thomas , Mark Boone Junior , Isaiah Washington ) but they have basically very little interesting to do in this movie , due to its weak script . It's quite silly really once you start to think about it ; the characters can all basically leave at any given moment once the terrifying and unusual things start to happen and their buddies are disappearing without a trace but yet none of them thinks about leaving , until it's too late of course . Nothing too horrible , just too lacking and not interesting or refreshing enough as a modern genre movie .

Text2: The movie serves it's purpose very well and that purpose is to entertain the young ones . Oh boy , did I loved this movie as a kid and so did all my friends . However now that I'm older I of course look differently at the movie and I've also more critic at it . It's a fantastic fantasy movie that suffers from a silly story and bad looking sets . It's so obviously filmed in a studio , that it truly reminded me of an old B-movie from the 50's . And sure , the story is original and fun but it also has some silly and just plain weird plot lines in it , that don't suit the movie because they distract too much from the main plot line and will probably bore the kids as well . The performances are excellent . Robin Williams actually plays one of the best roles out of his career ! Dustin Hoffman is highly amusing as Captain Hook and the lost boys are just awesome ! The movie has some excellent jokes and funny moments in it , which all makes the movie more than pleasant to watch . The action is Spielberg-like-good and the cinematography and music are more than excellent . The ending is somewhat disappointing because . . . well , it just looks weird and too fake , like it was rushed ( which it probably also was ) . However I don't think it's really fair from us grown ups to judge over this movie since it was obviously made for kids . So let the young ones judge this movie . I'm sure they'll enjoy it and are capable of looking past the fake looking sets and other weaker points of the movie . They most likely won't be disappointed and shall enjoy watching it from start till finish , unlike probably most of the fair and objective adults .

But at least the preceeding films had either a level of wit or chemistry - - perhaps both - - that made them quality entertainment . "" The Presidio , "" a cop-buddy film with Sean Connery and Mark Harmon , is nothing special at all . It's routine and boring , and if that wets your lips then dig in . Mark Harmon plays a Chicago cop brought in to investigate the murder of a fellow officer of the law . Sean Connery is his Scottish partner , a hard-nosed fellow with an attractive daughter ( played by Meg Ryan ) who takes a liking to Harmon ( by matter of script cliches ) . They hit it off much to the chagrin of her father , who continues to be paired with the young American . They end up in the usual car chases and on-foot pursuits . Action purses around just about every corner . There's a chase where Harmon is leaping over the hoods of cars and Sean Connery is dragging behind , looking very much out of breath and tired . But this is a boring film - - one that put me to sleep in the first minute and , from the looks of it , many other people , too . Connery tries hard to fight against the material , but Harmon is the film's primary flaw - - he's like Kevin Costner on sleeping medication . Meg Ryan is the typical sweet Girl Next Door love interest , but she would display much more acting skills in the next year's "" When Harry Met Sally "" with Billy Crystal . The script leaps all logic . It's as bleak , dry and typical as a film in this genre can get . I expected a nice source of entertainment in this film . It not only does not entertain , it literally repulses the viewer . Sean Connery and Mark Harmon have no chemistry on-screen . They pretty much just run about screaming at each other . Sean Connery has the Straight Man role that Arnold Schwarzenegger , Danny Glover and Nick Nolte have all played before . Which leaves room for the Comic Loose Man . But Harmon isn't a comical guy , and he isn't as loose as he is just plain ignorant . This is a poor example of buddies . The movie was directed by Peter Hyams , who obviously needs a lesson in how to properly construct a fast-paced and engaging cop-buddy film . This movie suffers from lack of pace and lack of solid direction - - one of its biggest flaws apart from casting decisions . Not only that , but the writer , Larry Ferguson , needs to take some lessons in how to cross the boundaries of a regular script and breathe into his characters life . There's a difference between written characters and typed characters . His are in the latter category . The movie is 97 minutes long and it feels two times longer . I recently saw a buddy flick called "" Hollywood Homicide "" with Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett . Even that film was better than this - - and "" Hollywood "" is making my list of the worst films of 2003 . Only really big fans of Sean Connery should venture near this . And the fans of Mark Harmon should all be taken out to a field and shot . stars . - John Ulmer

Text2: A REVIEW on the GAME : GRAND THEFT AUTO 3 ( 2001 ) ( stars ) With the voice talents of : JOE PANTOLIANO MICHAEL RAPAPORT In the game Grand Theft Auto 3 , your character is a man who has been betrayed , and left for dead by a partner in crime in Liberty City , where the only dirty word is hope . Now , he must restart his life by doing jobs for the local mafia , and meanwhile seek revenge on those who betrayed him . The main idea behind GTA3 is to provide you with a new experience . You are seeing your character with a third person view of Liberty City - a seedy area where anything goes . You can pretty much just steal any car on the street you see , as long as you can catch it . Some really good cars are hidden , for example , there's a car that's just like a jaguar hidden in a car shop and you must break in to get it . There's a hidden tank , and tons more fun , but the main idea is just to provide you with fun . Some people say this game is too violent , and after all I heard , when I played it the first time I expected tons of gore . But , it's not the most violent game I've seen . I have seen worse . It's really what you do in the game that counts . For example , you can walk over to someone walking on the street , and get in a fistfight , kill him or her , and steal his or her money . Or you could sniper out people with a sniper rifle , a weapon to choose from among the many you can get in the game . But with actions come consequences , because the more you do , the more ' stars ' you get-the most you can get being six . For each star represented , is a higher level of police after you . Eventually , you can get helicopters , snipers , and all trying to take you down . So if you play the game like this , it can be very bad for people affected by games . The whole basic idea of the game is revolving pretty much around mafia jobs so yes , I wouldn't recommend it to children . But you can also take taxi jobs , firefighter jobs , and police jobs , hunting down criminals like yourself . So with this in mind , you can also become a good guy . Depends what you want to be . Another fun thing , is with most car racing games and such , if you want a new car , you have to go to the start menu and choose a new car ( games like Project Gotham Racing , and Twisted Metal ) . But in this game , if you blow up your car , or simply want a new one , you just run over and pull someone out of his or her car , and steal it . Yes , agreeing with some people , this is kind of bad for people who are easily influenced to see things , so I don't recommend it to anyone who might look at this and think to themselves , ? I think I'll go hotwire cars ! ' : ) The graphics are very good , and the 3-D environment is very big for a game . You can travel by subway , car , plane , and more to 2 other cities near by ( after you progress in the game ) . So just experiencing the environment is worth the price of the game . It's very realistic , and in some parts of town it's extremely seedy ( you can guess what I mean ) . I think a few aspects like that could have been left out of the game , but I guess the publishers decided it would make it more realistic . Anyway , yes . I definitely do NOT recommend this game to children , for not only is there violence , but the jobs you do , and the city are both almost too realistic for any child to handle . But for older teens and above , the basic idea of GTA 3 is very fun . It's a great improvement on the previous games , and you can even change your third person view to the old above head view . The game's basically a mix between Max Payne , Great car games , The Sims , and The Godfather trilogy . It's simply one of the greatest game experiences I've ever had , and it is extremely addictive ( thank goodness I'm not someone who can play games and lose track of time , I would probably still think it's the day I bought the game ) . Anyone who wants to experience this same feeling of a virtual 3-D world of sleek , stylish cars at your hands , taking out jobs for the mafia , and so many other fun things in this game , please play it . Just don't get too addicted , because beware-it's very possible . Grand Theft Auto 3 is the very notion of what a game should be . The idea of a world where you don't really have to do anything - instead of having to crack levels by the same method ( take most games for example , to beat the level you must figure out how to get to the bad guy , kill him , and win the game . And although you can choose how to fight them , you basically have to follow the whole level , the same way everyone else who plays the game does , left here , right there , watch out for that guy who pops out of the corner in 30 seconds , etc . ) You can really explore Liberty City the way you want to . No standard level procedure . It's fully self-deciding on what you want to do , not what you have to do . That's what makes this game so enjoyable . Once again , GTA 3 is not a game for children but for adults . stars . Play it , and I promise it will be one of the most enjoyable game experiences you've had in a long , long time .

The comedy is light and earnest and has an excellent performance by Virginia Weidler , who as Joan Lyons , is at the center of the action . The film , directed by Edward Buzzell offered a view of an America at war where movie stars were adored by fans like Joan and her set . The film offers delightful cameo performances by some of the MGM stars of that time . Notably , Greer Garson , Walter Pigeon , Lana Turner and Robert Taylor , who appear as themselves . Ms . Garson and Mr . Pigeon have the best moments as they are seen talking to Joan and Patricia naturally and never appearing condescending , or patronizing . Virginia Weidler is the main reason for watching the film . She is witty , charming , and thoroughly disarming as the teen ager who loves the bigger than life stars . Also Edward Arnold as Joan's father has a good opportunity to do what he did best . Agnes Moorehead , Marta Linden , Raymond Roe , Jean Porter , among others , make this film a delight to watch . Sure , it's light fare , but it will surprise anyone because of the refreshing way the teen agers of the era were shown . There is such sweetness among them to make us yearn for a return to that happy era .

Text2: I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews , I was looking forward to it . After seeing it , I realized what people were excited about , it was Clint's performance , this is a man you do not want to mess with . He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance . I love his growls , he sounds like a great guard dog , I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise . I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is : he's a writer , director , and an actor , not to mention that he's great at all three of them . He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down , he's truly a good man . Walt Kowalski , a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran , lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants . At the start of the movie , Walt is attending his wife's funeral , bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich . Similarly , he has little patience with his two sons , Mitch and Steve , and their families , who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother . Walt's sons see him as "" always disappointed "" with them and their families , unaware of their obnoxiousness . Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors , a shy Thao Vang Lor and his feisty sister Sue , live with their widowed mother and grandmother . The Hmong gang , at that point , tries to persuade Thao to join them . Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car , a 1972 Gran Torino Sport . Walt interrupts the robbery , pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee . After a few days , Spider and his gang return . With Sue at his side , Thao manages to verbally confront them to no avail . The gang drags Thao off his porch in an attempt to assault him . His family tries desperately to fend off Spider and his cohorts . The conflict ends when Walt , who fought in the United States Army's 1st Cavalry Division , threatens the gang members with his M1 Garand rifle and orders them to get off his lawn . They leave the neighborhood , telling Walt to watch his back . After seeing Sue being harassed by three black teenagers , while her "" date "" cannot help her , Walt steps in to rescue her , confronting the teenagers and threatening them with a pistol . Sue gets to know Walt , and invites him to a family barbecue on his birthday , bringing him closer to her family , explaining Hmong culture and that during the Vietnam War they fought on "" his "" side . Sue , Thao , and their mother visit Walt the next day , with Thao's family forcing him to work for Walt for a week to atone for his attempted theft of the Gran Torino . Walt has Thao clean up the neighborhood until his debt is paid and shows Thao the ways of American men . Meanwhile , the Hmong gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them . But when he refuses , the Hmong gang goes too far in getting their revenge leading to Walt wanting more than punishment , he wants justice . I highly recommend Gran Torino if you get the chance to see it , it has terrific performances and a touching story . I'm really surprised that Clint didn't get more recognition for his strength in Walt , he became that character and I loved how he protected the family that he once hated . It was wonderful to see all these characters develop and grow together , they had great chemistry and made this movie into a great one . I think down the line , Gran Torino is going to be considered a classic , this is a terrific movie and deserves it's praise .","{""output"": ""NO""}"
1027,"Text1: To acknowledge the fact that genocides are still active in our supposedly enlightened times is terrifying , yet through films such as BEYOND THE GATES , HOTEL RWANDA , and SOMETIMES IN APRIL we are gradually bring informed about one particular genocide - that occurred in 1994 in Rwanda - and hopefully will make us as a global population more proactive in stemming the possibility of further acts of brutality and disregard of humanity . Writer David Wolstencroft and director Michael Caton-Jones have created one of the most powerfully poignant films about the genocide of the Tsutsi people by the Hutu people and by placing the film exactly where the genocide happened have added an intensely compelling atmosphere to an act that never should have happened . In 1994 , at the Ecole Technique Officielle , a school for the Rwandan children run by Europeans under the tutelage of Father Christopher ( John Hurt ) and with idealistic teachers such as the young Joe ( Hugh Dancy ) , the incipient intertribal rioting between the Hutus and Tsutsis is ' monitored by the impotent United Nations led by Capitaine Delon ( Dominique Horwitz ) . After the current leader of Rwanda is shot down in a helicopter tragedy , the Hutus begin killing the Tsutsi , butchering them with machetes and leaving the bodies to rot in the streets . The Tsutsis flock to the Ecole , looking for asylum and protection , and Father Christopher and Joe do everything in their power to provide food and shelter and safety . One particularly gifted student Marie ( Claire-Hope Ashitey ) works closely with the two men , gaining their admiration and love , and representing the desperate need of the Tsutsis . The UN forces refuse to fire on the invading Hutus and finally evacuate all white Europeans to be flow to safety out of Africa . It is this final abandonment of the Tsutsis that underlies the ensuing slaughter of those who sought help within the Ecole walls . And with showing the decimated Tsutsis the film ends with a few follow-up scenes that are deeply touching and immensely disturbing . It is clear that the film reveals how the world ignored the tragic genocide of 1994 and a more poignant statement has rarely been captured in writing , filming , direction , and acting . John Hurt and Hugh Dancy are brilliant in their roles , but it is the performance of young Claire-Hope Ashitey that rivets our attention : she is a wonder of an actress and deserves awards for her intensely realistic performance . The film's story is already known ( hopefully ) so there can be no spoilers here . And therein lies the agonizing reality that the world stood by and let this happen . Every world citizen should be required to see this powerful film in hopes that such atrocities will be prevented in the future . But then there is now Darfur . . . . . Grady Harp

1028,"Text1: Most IRA movies made in Hollywood are always criticised for the actors not sounding like real Irishmen . I have never once found this to be true and certainly not for Blown Away . Tommy Lee Jones is quite convincing as a deranged bomber who goes after Jeff Bridges in revenge for betraying him 25 years earlier . Stephen Hopkins uses his fave cinematographer and composer Peter Levy and Alan Silvestri to bring some visual style and a powerful musical score to accompany the action and explosion scenes . The final encounter between Jones and Bridges is WAY cool . Trust me . It's one of the best showdowns in history . A cool use of widescreen photography captures a pleasant and eye-pleasing view of Boston . I only ever saw this city in Cheers previously and now it makes wanna visit . This film was overlooked in the summer of 1994 because the audience was too busy with the other BOMB movie Speed . By that I mean movies with bombs . Not movies that are bombs . Speed was about a bomber wanting money . But Blown Away is a more personal , character-driven film and definitely the superior of the two .

Text2: In the Company of Men is a pathetic film with really pretentious attempts at irony and drama . It's the kind of movie that makes you want to rush out and get a huge dose of CGI Hollywood nonsense to clean it out of your system . It's crap like this that give independent / art movies a bad image . A bleak production design doesn't help the depressing , boring feel of the movie and the dull story is basically a cure for not being suicidal . Never ever watch this film . I wasted a whole Sunday afternoon watching this in the cinema when I really could have been doing something much more fun , like digging my own grave .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Were told that a US military / industrial operation for the US Army involving the drug company Gensystems got involved in a top-secret biological research experiment that suddenly went berserk when it . The by-product of the experiment , was introduced to the public as a fertility drug . One of the scientists working on this drug Jonathon Parker , Berry Bell , unwitting gave it to his wife Holly , Pamala Reed , to increase her chances of getting pregnant who eventually gave birth to twins two normal and healthy girls Alex & Lucy , Elke Larson & Kylie Larson , who were born with the virus in their systems . It was much later when they were in Gabon Africa with their father at the Gensystems Camp Rafflesla Research Facility that all hell broke loose when the two girls accidentally ate these genetically grown green barriers that brought the dormant and deadly virus out into the open . Spreading across the Atlantic after wiping out the entire Camp Rafflesla staff , except Lucy & Alex , the virus enters the US through a shipment of monkeys slated to be used for experimental purposes at Ft . Detrick MD . Within days it kills dozens of persons who as much as came in contact with either the monkeys or persons or were infected , by being bitten or sneezed at , by them . The movie gets a bit complicated when Doctor Maj . Carman Travis , Judith Light , and her colleague at Ft . Detrick Capt . Arends , Bill Nunn , start to uncover what's behind all these deaths . With the help of an unknown worker at Gensystems they come up with a government plan to use biological warfare against an enemy country by infecting It's people with the deadly drug . The plan was to sneak the drug into country as green berries and then have the virus activated by's it's population eating them . As both Maj . Travis & Capt . Arends get closer to the truth they find where the experiment were being conducted at a closed down US Army installation in Mississippi called Ft . Willard . Capt .

Col Bailey will do anything , even murder , to keep the truth form coming out about his and the US military and the president of Gensystems Frank Sanborn ( Nicholas Pryor ) , who had earlier committed suicide , involvement in them . Nail biting but predictable ending with Maj . Travis and Col . Bailey , Maj . Travis superior , facing off as the two sergeants under Col . Bailey's command are left with the unenviable dilemma of arresting Maj . Travis thus letting the entire country go to hell . The solders are thus faced with having hundreds of thousands if not millions of Americans die from this deadly and uncountable virus , in following their commanding officers Col . Bailey orders .

Text2: SPOILERS Hard hitting war drama with future President of the United States Ronald Reagan as US Army Captain Webb Sloane going undercover-as as an American POW-to get the goods on the Reds in how they brutally and inhumanly threat , against the rules of warfare , their prisoners of war in that hell that was the Korean War . In order to throw off suspicion on himself Sloane becomes a Commie stooge , or collaborator , that makes his fellow GI's in the POW camp hate his very guts . Hard as he tries to be a Commie rat-fink Sloane can't help showing his true colors-Red White & Blue-instead of the ones-deep Commie Red-he masks himself with . That fact soon comes to light in Sloane coming to aid of his fellow American POW's when the chips are down . This has Sloane saving one of of the POW's lives when he came down with a near-fatal attack of appendicitis ! In another heroic effort Sloane prevented another GI Cpl . Joe Stanton , Steve Forrest-who killed the camps brutal commissar Russian Col . Biroshilov played by Oskar Homolka-from being shot by hiding the evidence of what he did . This was after Cpl . Stanton killed Col . Biroshilov for having his cute little pet dog Eloise beaten to death , in order to make Stanton cooperate , in front of his very eyes ! SPOILER ALERTIn the end Sloane did get the evidence of what a bunch of vicious and sadistic swines the Commies were but to his surprises he wasn't sent to the Soviet Union as he planned , so he can be a mole inside the Kremlin for the US . Sloane instead was shipped , after being released from prison , straight back home in the good old USA . That dubious honor , of being sent to the USSR , went to fellow US Commie collaborator and undercover agent Pvt . ? ? ? ? who had less to lose in being that he's single and with no living family members back in the states , like Sloane has , for him to worry about . The movie shows how the rotten Commies used captured GI's , through both threats and persuasion , to confess to war crimes that they didn't commit in order to turn the free world against the USA back then in the early 1950's . It took brave and patriotic Americans like Webb Sloane , by risking their very lives , to set the record straight in who , the USA / UN forces or Red Chinese / North Korean Communists , were really committing major war crimes in the Korean War . But sadly enough , like in the movie , many many patriotic American soldiers broke under the unrelenting pressure , of Commie brainwashing or just plain old intimidation , and ended up helping the Commie cause if just only in being used for propagandist purposes . These brave but later broken US fighting men who were in many cases driven insane by the Commies around the clock brainwashing tactics have to live with what they did , in helping Americas sworn enemies , for the rest of their lives .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
1030,"Text1: As an absolute avid horror movie fan / buff , I had been directed to this movie over and over . This is one of the most highly praised ( if not THE most highly praised ) European horror movie of all time . Whenever anyone asks , "" What horror movies are good ? What should I see ? "" this movie is invariably in the elitist list . Its use of light and color is , indeed , a true study of cinematic technique and style . So what ? ! The one good idea Argento had ( the imagery ) was simply not enough to cover for the total lack of script , acting talent , meaningful dialog , horrible direction of these "" actresses , "" and the downright cheese-filled all-out crap ? fest that is Suspira . SPOILERS ABOUNDIn the first death scene , the acting was the most puerile trash I've ever witnessed ( and I've SEEN Killer Klowns from Outer Space ) . These girls did not die well , prettily , or with grace . In fact , they didn't die with talent , either . The "" death scenes "" were nothing but an indication to me that this should have been the death of the movie . There simply aren't words for how horribly these girls portrayed their parts . Honestly , if the red-head had actually fallen that far with a cord attached around her neck , the weight of her body would have popped her head off her neck , rather than the sloppy inane banality we were given . Inane banality actually sums up the entirety of this movie . I cannot believe how highly recommended this trite piece of garbage is in the horror field . This was actually much , MUCH worse than "" I Still Know What You Did Last Summer , "" which was a total waste of my time . A friend , who watched this garbage with me observed , "" You know , Fiend ? Aside from no one being naked , this really reminds me of a porno . "" Okay , hence the exploitation feel of this film . I don't care . How could I possibly care ? The "" atmosphere "" everyone raves about just came off as a really bad porn and nothing more . Nothing could have saved this film from Argento's lack of talent but a really good remake . Hopefully , they won't make the mistake of assuming that this was , in any way , to be considered "" artsy . "" The acting quality is nonexistent and the screen play should have been exorcised and then buried in about 7 tons of salt , if you ask me . Even the "" ballerinas "" were inept . I've seen better down at the local play house . Most of the players and the director being Italian is a far cry from making this "" art . "" European does not equate "" art . "" Sorry , but um . . . no . This is rubbish . Nothing but unadulterated crap . The "" effects "" are laughable and there was not one redeeming performance in this whole venture . All I've accomplished in watching this garbage is the wasting of 95-98 minutes . I should've taken a nap , instead . The time would have been put to much better use . The musical score sounded like something that a two-year-old crackhead relentlessly banged out on the kitchen pots and pans in an epileptic seizure to rival the mother of all epileptic fits . The sound effects were distracting rather than complementary ; cutting in and out at the worst possible moments , and coming off like some irritating noise an eight year old was making in the back seat of the car to annoy his dork brother . Refuse to be one of those mindless sheep who follow the herd . Don't allow yourself to be dragged into the whole mindset that because it's Argento , it's genius . That's just NOT the case , as Suspira MORE than proves . This is the most dismally wretched act of cinematic micturition ever to be committed to film , and I've seen some real stinkers in my time .

1031,"Text1: Though James Arness and Bruce Boxleitner are a good fit for the roles originated by John Wayne and Montgomery Clift and Ray Walston stands in very well as the old-timer sidekick to both instead of Walter Brennan , the television remake of Red River sinks right to the bottom . The thing that I missed most from the original film was Dimitri Tiomkin's music , one of the finest film scores ever done . It really set the tone for the film , actually helped give you that sense of movement of the cattle , helped you empathize with the size and scope of the herd and the task that John Wayne undertook in the original . If the producers had done nothing else , they should have paid whatever price was necessary to get that music . Whole chunks of dialog from the original is taken . There is a new plot component in this film that of black cowboy Stan Shaw who Boxleitner and Arness take on despite racial objections from some of the ex-Confederate soldiers would have made . Shaw does a fine job and his inclusion is the only improvement on the original because in real life Wayne and Clift would no doubt have had black cowboys on their drive . Laura Johnson as a Civil War widow is an extreme let down from Joanne Dru's slinky Tess Millay from the original . It wasn't Johnson's fault , just not a good idea to change her type . But that was necessary to set up the confrontation between Bruce Boxleitner and Gregory Harrison who has John Ireland's part which is also a big plot change from the original . I think those who remember fondly the John Wayne classic will be much let down with this one .

Text2: When Universal found they had a gold mine in two burlesque comedians named Bud Abbott and Lou Costello they rushed them into film after film . In the early years of their Unviersal contract the boys did film after film . Since Universal did most of it's product on the cheap for a major studio Bud and Lou became major moneymakers . Have you ever noticed that in their earliest films while they are top billed , Bud and Lou are extraneous to the plot . There's usually some romantic story plot and always some musical entertainment . Ride ' Em Cowboy fits this formula perfectly . Dick Foran who appeared in three Abbott and Costello films in this period is a western story writer who's publicity agent has made him a western superhero . Foran sings real nice , but he can barely ride a horse . Anne Gwynne , daughter of a dude ranch owner , learns the truth and spurns him . But the smitten Foran is determined to make himself all the cowboy she expects of him . Dick Foran who had done some singing cowboy films at Warner Brothers in the Thirties was now at Universal and he had a pleasant singing voice and an easy manner that never intruded on the comedy of Bud and Lou . A big hit song for the World War II years , I'll Remember April , was introduced by him in this film . And if Foran introducing a hit song wasn't enough , Universal got the Merry Macs to perform a few numbers and Ella Fitzgerald reprised her A Tisket A Tasket hit from the mid thirties . Something for everyone . But after all this is Bud and Lou's film and they have some good moments themselves . Funniest I think is Costello trying to break a horse and he literally ropes Abbott along for the ride . Douglass Dumbrille plays an Indian chief . For me , just the sight of the polished villainous Mr . Cedar of Mr . Deeds Goes to Town in an Indian suit is funny enough . But Costello shoots an arrow through the painted heart of his daughter's tepee which in that tribe is a marriage proposal . Costello is going to be wed to an Indian princess who looks like Rosie O'Donnell . He balks at the prospect and a running gag throughout the film is Dumbrille and the tribe chasing Costello to get him to the altar in a bow and arrow wedding . This same gag with the same principal players is used in their later film Lost in a Harem for MGM . This is one of my favorite Abbott and Costello films and when you get to see it , it will be a favorite of your's as well .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

There are many better screen musicals , but there are also many that are far worse . Suffice it to say that Hollywood , which had churned out one disastrous musical after another for the last decade , finally got back to producing a musical it could be proud of . This beautiful story about a simple milkman in turn-of-the-century Russia who must come to terms with the loss of the safe and only world he has ever known , succeeds on screen largely due to the performance of Topol , who breathes body and soul into Tevye the milkman and creates one of those characters that for ever after you instantly associate with the actor who played him . You can feel him working overtime to keep Jewison's lumbering physical production on its feet , and his efforts prove themselves to be nearly Herculean , since Jewison can't direct a musical number to save his life . "" Fiddler on the Roof "" is not a dance musical , but it does have some rousing dance numbers courtesy of Jerome Robbins ; however , you wouldn't know it from this movie , since Jewison almost unfailingly chooses the worst camera angle from which to shoot every single frame of the musical portions . What the movie does boast , however , is a glorious version of the musical's beautiful score , left nearly intact and memorably orchestrated by John Williams . It soars and leaps even when the production it's anchored to just sits like a lump .

Text2: A long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . . There was a boy who was only two years old when the original "" Star Wars "" film was released . He doesn't remember first seeing the movie , but he also doesn't remember life before it . He does remember the first "" Star Wars "" themed gift he got . . . a shoebox full of action figures from the original set . He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be . But years later , he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received : another box full of action figures , ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection . It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed , Anakin Skywalker , stopped being produced and carried in stores , and how this boy went for about ten years ( until he got into college ) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets ( don't ask . . . it's a Northern Illinois University thing ) . I can't review "" Star Wars "" as a movie . It represents absolutely everything good , fun and magical about my childhood . There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases , birthdays , summers and winters growing up . In the winter , my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth ( I was always Han Solo ) . My friends ' dad built them a kick-ass tree house , and that served as the Ewok village . They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it , and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home .

I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time .

1033,"Text1: It's weird . This film is so juvenile but the throw in one ' fck ' so it has a PG-13 rating so people don't think it is too childish . Although there is some obvious dubbing of more profanity . Listen to Bacon say ' Motherhumper ' . What is that supposed to mean ? The idea behind the film is interesting as some scenes and events are quite entertaining but the execution of most of it really lame and amateur . The dialogue is quite bad throughout . Especially in the explanation of the worms origination . How did they get here ? ' It doesn't matter ' , one of the characters says . Wow ! Great imagination there . They don't even bother to give us an explanation . Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a great duo . Although the characters they play hate their lifestyles it seems pretty cool to me . Although I do realize it was made in 1989 it seems very 80's . The girlfriend of Kevin Bacon is entirely responsible for this . She kind of annoyed me too . Her attempts at being smart and witty just do not work . But Michael Gross was cool as Burt . I like how he is gung-ho without being irritating . It's hard to be gung-ho without getting on my nerves . Also , the smart-ass little kid who always whines is funny . The death scenes could have been a little more graphic but the fast pace of the plot after it gets going makes up for it .

Text2: I know a lot of you who have never seen Beavis and Butthead probably think very little of the show based on the low-brow nature of it ( I was one of them ) , but if you give this movie a chance you'll see that it's actually as well written and at times as , dare I say , subtle as King of the Hill . Beavis and Butthead have their TV stolen and when trying to get it back are mistaken for hit men by drunken drunk Muddy Grimes ( Bruce Willis , as I was rather shocked to find out once the credits rolled ) , who sends them on a mission to ' do his wife ' Dallas . Misinterpreting this as any horny teenagers would , B+B head to Las Vegas to carry out the terrible act . But we discover ( they don't , however ) that Dallas and Muddy are part of international weapons conspiracy and our two teen-aged heroes are being set-up to take the blame . So , as they take off across the country , causing absolute mayhem wherever they go , the ATF closely follow , giving full body cavity searches to everyone and anyone they meet at the order of head honcho Agent Flemming ( the late Robert Stack ) , who comes out with some brilliant , deadpan one-liners . The set-pieces are wonderful and the mushroom-induced dream sequence by Rob Zombie looks amazing . Mike Judge's animation style also brilliant . Avoiding bright , primary colors used in shows such as The Simpsons , Family Guy and Futurama , he uses mainly softer colors , pencil-effect scenery and water-color backgrounds . It's a sort of calming , easy-going animation style that he's totally made his own . You should totally check-out this movie .

But IN OLD CHICAGO is insufferable in terms of story , pacing , acting and any sense of reality until the O'Leary cow knocks over that lantern . Then we're treated to one of the best fire sequences ever shown on screen - - long before the aid of computer technology . If only the rest of the picture had been able to match the fire ! Faye is given some over-the-top costuming which cheapens her overall appearance to such an extent that it's hard to see why she's the main attraction for Ameche and Power . Power was still at the pretty boy stage of his good looks and his acting had not quite jelled when he did this role . The fight sequence between him and Ameche is well handled though . Ameche simply fades into the background as the good brother . Faye was said to be pleased with the fact that she was given a more dramatic role for a change . Unfortunately , not much can be said with what she did with this opportunity . Alice Brady is up to the demands of her role as the O'Leary mother who wants her sons to make their mark in the world . However , the film comes to life only for the final twenty minutes or so of fire . Otherwise , it's got a story as dull as dishwater and provides Alice Faye with one of her least appealing roles . It makes ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND look like a masterpiece . It takes much too long to get to that famous 1871 fire .

Text2: ALICE ADAMS is the film I'd heard about for years as one of Hepburn's best early films so when I had the chance to watch it recently on TCM I took advantage of it . From a novel by Booth Tarkington , it concerns a young woman anxious to connect socially with the right people who manages to attract the attention of a handsome and well-to-do young man ( Fred MacMurray ) at a party . Hepburn shines in the title role , looking fresh and attractive , struggling to keep him interested in her - - but unfortunately , with all of her trademark mannerisms not always held in check . She does well in the role but , in my opinion , the real magnet of interest is the under-appreciated Fred MacMurray who does a sincere and effortless job as her suitor in a role that could not have been easy to bring off . Both stars are in their physical prime , but MacMurray's naturalness only makes Hepburn look even more mannered than usual . Fortunately , this works because her character is supposed to be putting on airs . But at times , this is overdone . The awkwardness of the social situations are exploited - - and the highpoint has to be the warm dinner served on a hot evening , complete with maid service ( by Hattie McDaniel ) in one of the movie's most amusing , if uncomfortable , scenes . Here too , MacMurray displays just the right amount of stability against all odds . Fred Stone provides a number of chuckles as Hepburn's so provincial father . All of the supporting roles are nicely filled , with special praise for Ann Shoemaker as the concerned mother anxious for her daughter to find the right suitor . But it's Hepburn's showcase under George Stevens ' sensitive direction and she is convincing despite the overly mannered performance . Summing up : Although some of the situations seemed a bit forced and not everyone will appreciate the humor at Hattie McDaniel's expense , it's worth watching for Hepburn and MacMurray alone .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

This comedy-drama is handled in a very quiet manner and the focus seems to be more on the man , played by Jason Priestley , rather than his wife , played by Nicole Scipione , which keeps the tone a touch lighter than it might have been handled , keeping a good balance between comedy and sadness . Even Cheech Marin plays the local priest largely straight . While this is not the best TV movie ever made , it is a pretty good effort and worth your time .

Text2:  Magic Town  is a film about something that we nowadays take as normal but which was a novelty in 1947 . It was about the new "" science "" of public opinion polling . This was only understood poorly and not only by the public but by those who actually mattered : the politicians who would grow to need them . In 1936 the Literary Digest , a popular magazine of the day , had conducted a poll of it's membership on who would win the Presidency . It concluded that Governor Alfred Landon of Kansas , a capable man , would beat incumbent President Franklin Roosevelt . Unfortunately the readership of the Digest were upper class , and basically Republican ( as Landon was ) . In November 1936 FDR won one of the biggest landslides in political history , with three quarters of the popular vote and all the electoral votes except for those of Maine and Vermont . Literary Digest went out of business shortly afterwords . In the decade since Roper and Gallup had been improving polling techniques , but the full system was still uncertain . In the 1948 election there would be another polling snafu , with most of the polls awarding the election to Governor Thomas Dewey of New York , as opposed to incumbent President Harry Truman . Harry won a remarkable come-from-behind over Tom , and enjoyed showing off a headline from the Republican "" Chicago Tribune "" saying that Tom won . In the midst of all this there was a classic sociology study entitled "" Middletown "" . Set in the typical mid-American town ( it was in the Midwest ) the authors ( a husband and wife team ) showed how it's citizens opinions mirrored what mid-America believed . Ten years later the same authors published a follow up study of the town , and it turned there was little change in the opinion differentials between the town and the country . It is with the "" Middletown "" study that the background of this film was based . Jimmy Stewart and his assistants ( including Ned Sparks and Donald Meek - in his last role ) are pollsters , and Stewart has a theory he has been working on that would save pollsters millions . He believes there is a perfect community in the middle of America that can be used for polling it's citizens . He has been studying the problem for several years , and he has found a town where the percentages of the opinions of the citizens perfectly mirror those of the American people as a whole . Stewart goes to the town and sets up there with the intention of using the citizens as his poling guinea pigs , but ( as the movie progresses ) he gets involved with Jane Wyman and the others in the town . When Wyman discovers Stewart's plans she reveals them , and the town goes crazy . Their sudden unofficial power goes to their heads , and instead of giving the sensible polling answers to questions they give outlandish ones . This causes the crash of their reputation , and the crisis of the film . It is a first rate film and has some nice touches ( including Gabriel Heater intoning on the radio ) . As an early story regarding the polling industry it is unique , and the film is well acted and directed ( by William Wellman ) . Perhaps not a Capra movie , but it is a nice one all the same .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: In "" Rise "" , Lucy Liu gets one of the most complex characters of her career so far - certainly a far cry from the fluffy "" Charlie's Angels "" - and she is absolutely compelling to watch . She is by turns scared , confused , desperate , driven , brutal , ruthless , cruel , humane , compassionate . She is both a heroine ( taking revenge against the serial killing vampire clan that left her for dead ) , and an anti-heroine ( killing innocent people to survive ) . She is a victim AND a victimizer . And she is solidly supported by the rest of the cast : Michael Chiklis takes a role that could have easily been just a sidekick , and makes him important . James D'Arcy , as the head villain , is both repulsive and suave . And Carla Gugino manages to make a strong impression in about 10 minutes of total screen time . The director keeps the story tight , at least in the first hour ( and I'm surprised that so many people found the film's simple time twists "" confusing "" - I wonder how long they would last in "" The Prestige "" . . . . ) , and makes very judicious use of gore - there is just enough needed to make the point and move the story along , but not too much to slip into gratuitous excess . "" Rise "" does look and feel like a B-movie , but sometimes a well-made B-movie is preferable to an overproduced blockbuster .

However , AH-NULD is in his way , as miserable , alcoholic ex-cop Jericho Cane , who stopped ' believing ' when his family was murdered by crooked cops .

It certainly does have a lot of energy , and good performances by AH-NULD ( believe it or not ! ) , Byrne , Tunney , CCH Pounder ( a criminally underused actress , in my opinion ) and Rod Steiger , playing a priest 20 years after he played one in "" The Amityville Horror "" .

1038,"Text1: Manipulative drama about a glamorous model ( Margaux Hemingway ) who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician ( Chris Sarandon ) – to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister ( played by real-life sibling Mariel ) , whose music teacher he is . While the central courtroom action holds the attention – thanks largely to a commanding performance by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway’s lawyer – the film is too often merely glossy , but also dramatically unconvincing : the jury ostensibly takes the musician’s side because a ) the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b ) she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together . What the f ? ! ; she was clearly tied up – what resistance could she realistically offer ? The second half of the film – involving Sarandon’s rape of the sister , which curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE ( 2002 ) by occurring in a tunnel – is rather contrived : Mariel’s character should have known better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to her sister , but Margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately ! The climax – in which Sarandon gets his just desserts , with Margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante – is , however , a crowd-pleaser in the style of DEATH WISH ( 1974 ) ; incidentally , ubiquitous Italian movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films . It’s worth noting how the two Hemingway sisters’ lives took wildly different turns ( this was the film debut of both ) : Margaux’s career never took off ( despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here ) – while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen’s MANHATTAN ( 1979 ) and , interestingly , would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real-life "" Playboy "" centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosse’s STAR 80 ( 1983 ) . With the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages , Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 ; chillingly , the Hemingway family had a history of suicides – notably the sisters’ grandfather , celebrated author Ernest , who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961 .

Text2: Following his 11-year tenure in Hollywood between 1941 and 1952 , expatriate German director Siodmak decided to return to Europe ; he would subsequently contrive to make three more English-language films , even if they weren’t up to his best work in the States – but , then , neither was the ‘foreign’ stuff . This costumer ( a remake of a 1938 film by Maurice Tourneur ) is a German / French co-production : it’s a good-looking if stilted melodrama involving impossible love in the Russian court of Alexander II ( Curd Jurgens ) ; with an ailing wife , he draws his amorous attention to a proud teenage beauty ( Romy Schneider ) . Their romance , however , is likely to throw the already troubled Czarist rule ( by the activities of a group of terrorists seeking more humane laws ) into turmoil ; he himself mistrusts his ministers , but they in their turn are willing to collaborate with the ‘enemy’ in order to put a stop to Jurgens and Schneider’s love – which is giving the Empire a bad name thus threatening their own position ! In fact , during the course of the film , we are witness to no fewer than four attempts on the Czar’s life – which is a bit much , if you ask me ; nevertheless , it’s in scenes like these where we get a glimpse of the old Siodmak ( he was one of the finest exponents of Film Noir ) : the film’s most creative bit of direction is Siodmak’s decision to refrain from showing a duel but rather concentrate on the snow-covered trees nearby and only cutting to the bloodied body ( Katia’s officer brother who was defending her honor ! ) once the shots are heard on the soundtrack . The revolutionaries themselves – led by future Claude Chabrol regular Michel Bouquet – are typically depicted as desperate men ( and women ) rather than villainous ( a fate reserved for the Ministers , though they’re actually more pitiful and misguided in their own self-importance than truly evil ) ; the ultimate irony is that Jurgens had always been sympathetic to the terrorists’ cause , but the burden of tradition and a whole set of events ( such as the release of the rebels’ imprisoned friends , promised them by the Emperor via Katia , seen as an act of betrayal when the Ministers arrange for the ex-convicts to be gunned down soon after ) eventually seal his fate . . . just as , with the Empress dead , Schneider was about to take her place on the throne by his side ! For the record , the impossibly young Schneider had actually risen to stardom with a similar Ruritanian i . e . quasi fairy-tale role – that of Princess Sissi in a series of three Austrian films made between 1955 and 1957 ; as for Jurgens , I have his second of two Michel Strogoff films ( made in 1956 and 1961 ) recorded , as was this one , off Italian TV awaiting its turn to be watched . Finally , given KATIA’s silly U . S . retitling , one shouldn’t confuse it with an earlier Siodmak picture from his Hollywood days – THE GREAT SINNER ( 1949 ) which , incidentally , was also a period piece about Russians ( adapted , as a matter of fact , from Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s "" The Gambler "" ) .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
1039,"Text1: SPOILERS Bittersweet romantic comedy that takes place in Utah with love-struck civil servant Charles , John Heard , who gets stung by the love bug and almost ends up going out of his head because of it . Charles falls literally heads over heels in love with his fellow worker the just separated from her husband Ox ( Mark Metcalf ) Laura , Mary Beth Hunt . Catching Laura on the rebound from her breakup with her estranged husband Ox , who at 6 foot three and all muscles is an ox of a man , has Charles go completely bananas over her to the point where Laura agrees to share an apartment , as well as sleep , with him . As times goes by with Laura starting to get a bit tired of Charles ' possessiveness and pandering to her she decides to leave him and go back to Ox and her stepdaughter , from Ox's previous marriage , nine year-old Rebecca , Algela Philips . It's then that Charles start to lose it with Laura out of his life and him now being pressured by his constantly threatening to kill herself mother Clara , Gloria Grahame , and unemployed live-in best friend Sam , Peter Reigert . It's Charles attempt to win Laura back that really drives him off the edge but in a harmless sort of way . Charles , together with Sam , goes so far as to used the excuse to see Laura that he goes to her home where she's living with Ox and Rebecca to have him , a carpenter , build Charles some wall panelings . It's then , to Ox's both shock and anger , that Charles risking getting his arms twisted out of place pledges his love for Laura who's , embarrassingly , there with him ! As Charles ' efforts to win over a very reluctant Laura goes nowhere he starts to turn nasty towards those at his job who try to be friendly towards him . Charles really turns off Betty , Nora Haflin , who he's been , without her knowledge , using as a go between himself and her best friend at the job who just happens to be Laura . It's out of hurt and frustration that Charles becomes down right nasty to Betty , who seemed to have fallen in love with him , in that she can't bring him and Laura back together . Charles also takes his frustration out at his very kind and accommodating boss Mr . Patterson , Jerry Hardin , who wants him to help his immature son get his head , and love life , on straight . As it turned out the person who could , and in the end did , help Charles out of his pressing problems with Laura is the blind man , Allen Joseph , who has a newspaper & candy stand in the lobby of the building that Charles works in . Always taking Allen for granted and at the same time spilling his heart out to him , about his love Laura , Charles gets the best advice about straightening out the mess that he's got himself into . And sure enough by the time the movie ends Charles finally acts on it . Charles finally gets over his obsession with Laura and at same time gets himself back to sanity . Lovely story about love and how it can drive one crazy if he , or she , can't-when it turns sour-let go of it . A very important lesson in life which took Charles almost the entire movie to figure out . SPOILERS Allen's advice did help but in the end it was Charles who had to take the first step , running what looked the hundred yard dash in less then 10 seconds , to finally have him get over his illogical and almost destructive , to himself and those close to him , love for Laura . P . S The novel "" Chilly Scenes of Winter "" whom the film "" Heads Over Heels "" is based on was written by Ann Beattie who has a cameo role in the movie as a waitress .

Text2: SPOILERS Romico doing sketches of scenery around town gets the attention of a gang of bikers who feel that their privacy had been invaded . The bikers then take it upon themselves to break the artists hands for doing it . You wonder just what's the big deal since the bikers , lead by this spaced out lunatic Keeg , are really doing nothing illegal at the time and can easily be photographed by dozens of people , including the police themselves who must have a number of their mug shots . The bikers getting Romico alone in his apartment house has Keeg slicing him in the stomach with a straight edge razor . Thats to teach Romico a lesson and keep him from drawing them but that just gets Romico , after he recovers , angrier . It turns out that Keeg and his gang are out on the streets picking up and recruiting young girls for this big-time Las Vages pimp that they work for . The thought that Romico's drawings of Keeg and his boys , and girls , will alert the local vice squad to his actions are as ridicules as Keeg himself . Since the Vice Squad headed by Det . Scott Bardy have been on to him for some time and must have an album of photos of his and his gang . The only reason you can gather for his unbalanced and bazaar actions is that he's suffering from some kind of paranoia from all the drugs and booze he's been taking and drinking . Romico injury meanwhile is being taken care of by this quack doctor and Lea who later turns out to be a spy for Keeg . The doctor gets Romico out of his apartment and into Lea's place where Romioc is given a bowl of hot soup and some close and warm attention from Lea has Keeg's bikers break into Romico's pad and steal his drawings . With Romico finding out that his place had been ransacked by the bikers and that his prize sword , who's significances is never explained to the audience , stolen he immediately goes to their hideout and beats up two of the bikers thus getting his sword back from them and leaving the place in shambles . This makes Keeg even more determined to do in Romico and then plans to kidnap him and break his hands so he'll never draw again . We also have this little episode in the movie where Keeg and his bikers rob this guy of his motorcycle in broad daylight at a local park beating him unconscious . All this seemed to be put in just to show how wild and crazy he and his boys . The scene had really nothing to do with either Romico Lea or later Janie , who was inducted into Keegs club and then gang raped and shot up with drugs and acid . It was Janie who wanted to join Keeg's gang , and then turned into a hooker and junkie by doing it , that eventually brought him down by almost dropping dead in the park . Janie tells the vice squad at the hospital what Keeg and his gang did , this gives the police the proof that they need to bust him and him gang . Keeg meanwhile had Romico kidnapped and brought to his hideout where his hands were about to be crushed in a vice . It's then that Lea changes her mind about betraying Romico and comes to his rescue freeing him by pulling a gun out on Keeg & Co . and having Romico released . The cops now on their way to the bikers hideout , after being told by Janie where it was , has Keegs about to take off but his biker moll Sandy is now afraid that he's leaving her . Keeg told Sandy Earlie that she doesn't have what it takes to be a member of his "" exclusive "" organization . Sandy grabbing Lea's gun and shooting wildly alerts the cops and has Keeg running for his life as all the other bikers scatter like a bunch of cockroaches when you turn the lights on . Onside Sandy who couldn't hit Keeg at point blank range in the clubhouse shoots wildly at the motorcycle fleeing Keeg from some 100 feet away , the gun actually jerks upwards before it goes off , and amazingly Sandy hits Keeg square on target killing him instantly . The movie ends with Sandy crying and holding the dying Keeg in her arms as the scene turns , or morphs , into one of Romico's drawings . More like a home movie then anything else with Bruce Dern as Keeg doing a good job looking like he's strung out on drugs . Chris Robinson as the sensitive and courageous artist Rominco looks as if he's sorry that he's in the movie and trying to keep a straight face in all the scenes he's in . Even when his hands are being screwed into a vice Robinson is so unconcerned to what's happening to him that he looks like his mind , or concentration , is anywhere but in the scene that he's in !","{""output"": ""NO""}"
1040,"Text1: I was expecting this to be longer ( it ran for just 90 minutes ) since most sources cite it as being close to the 2 hour-mark . . . although one never really knows with Silent films given the variety of projection speeds involved ! Anyway , it's a rare ' horror ' film for Griffith and one that , reportedly , he did against his will . . . in fact , it was originally intended for Cecil B . DeMille ! As it happens , it's pictorially sumptuous but , typically of Griffith , rather static ; for having been a pioneer of cinema , his occasional reluctance to move the camera is both strange and regrettable ( some of the close-ups of his leading lady here seem interminable ) . The Faustian plot is reasonably compelling if predictable and the acting plaudits effortlessly go to Adolphe Menjou who brings his customary sartorial elegance to the titular character ; on the other hand , Carol Dempster is nowhere near as expressive as Lillian Gish had been in Griffith's earlier films . Even so , the director seemed far more at home during her melodramatic scenes than in depicting the sophistication of the high-life hero Ricardo Cortez breaks into , and even less so with its essential supernatural elements ! While individual scenes deliver the goods ( the fantastic opening sequence set in Heaven showing the banishment of Lucifer and his minions , Menjou's initial materialization in Cortez's apartment and the finale when he reverts back to his true form to menace Cortez - wisely shown only as a huge bat-like shadow ) , the film really needed a European sensibility to do it full justice rather than the hand of a Victorian romantic who was past his prime anyway ! Still , it's very much a worthwhile if essentially patchy enterprise and I would certainly love to catch up with the director's other ' horror ' work eventually - THE AVENGING CONSCIENCE ( 1914 ) and ONE EXCITING NIGHT ( 1922 ) .

Text2: A curious mix of CITY OF GOD ( 2002 ) and QUIZ SHOW ( 1994 ) , this surprising multi-Oscar winner is a good film to be sure but also somewhat overrated ( as was director Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING [ 1996 ] after all ) . The editing is deftly intricate ( spanning several years , the story continually jumps back and forth in time ) and the exotic score certainly effective ; however , Boyle's flashy technique rings false within the context of its underprivileged setting ! SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE may have alerted the rest of the world to the dire conditions of life in ( the so-called ) modern India but , at the same time , it cannot have benefited the country's tourist industry any ! The film's trump card is actually the ' impossible romance ' at its core : the two young leads are believable and undeniably appealing . The whole "" Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ? "" angle , then , has a decidedly contrived feel to it : though apparently based on fact , the film was clearly intended as a fable . That said , some of the flashbacks do not really illuminate us as to how the hero knew the respective answer : for instance , does someone need to know who invented the revolver just because he owns one ( much less an uneducated person ) and would the final all-important question of such a show be one to which the answer could have easily been arrived at by common sense ( had it not been a recurring motif ) ?","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Sandra Oh plays a woman with a mission , she's gathering provisions for the last hours at a local store but there's not much left , and when she emerges her car has been trashed . So she's left with no way to reach her home and her husband , and manages to hook up with Patrick ( McKellar ) and enlist his help . There are several people that have decided how they want to live their last moments and their paths manage to cross here and there , and one young man has made a list of all the sexual exploits he'd like to experience before the end and is busily working his way through them , and one even involves a homosexual encounter with his buddy Patrick but Patrick ( thankfully ) passes .

He is so well respected by his relatives that they named their oldest daughter ( Teresa Wright ) Charlie . When Uncle Charlie first arrives , everything seems to be going very nicely and everyone is having a lot of fun . But then , Young Charlie begins to get suspicious . That's as much as I'm going to tell you about the plot , because I worry that any more information will give everything away . However , I will discuss some interesting aspects in the movie . For starters , duality . There are two Charlies , two bespectacled females , two trips to the train station , two trips to the restaurant , and even when Alfred Hitchcock makes his cameo , he is carrying a piece of luggage almost as big as he is . This all may have something to do with the idea that there are two sides to everything ( which turns out to be an important aspect in this movie ) . Also , Santa Rosa looks like a town in a Norman Rockwell painting , but then , everything changes . In one scene , Young Charlie is trying to call people on the phone , but can't reach them . Each time they show her again , the scene is shot from a higher angle , as though she is sinking deeper into desperation . I guess that overall , the movie is about how Young Charlie is forced to grow out of her youthful impression of the "" good old days "" , as represented by "" The Merry Widow Waltz "" , played during a repeated scene of a grand ball . The words "" merry widow "" also play a role in the plot . That is all that I can tell you . Any more would definitely give away the ending .

The film is mainly a showcase for the beautiful , athletic , voluptuous woman and convincing , tough fighter Jillian Kesner - and I have no complaints there : she has about 10 fight scenes in this movie , the first one of which occurs after only 2 minutes ! The production is very cheap , but the fight choreography is actually quite good - not exactly on the level of early Jackie Chan but certainly vastly preferable to the heavily wired , computer-enhanced crap that so often passes for martial arts today . The long scene in which Kesner ends up topless as she tries to fight off two attackers is not just exploitation , but almost a statement : here is this undressed , unarmed , completely feminine woman and these two men can't touch her , can't even go near her without getting hurt .

Text2: The San Francisco Earthquake happened 99 years ago next week . Ironically it's anniversary is a few days after the anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic , as well as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . Forgotten is also the anniversary on April 27 of the explosion and burning of the steamboat Sultana in 1865 ( which killed more people than the Titanic did ! ) . Truly T . S . Eliot's comment , "" April is the cruelest month "" has some substantial facts to back it . There are not many movies dealing with famous earthquakes , although they do appear in films like PENNY SERENADE ( where Irene Dunne and Cary Grant survive the great Tokyo earthquake of 1923 ) . The San Francisco Earthquake has popped up in other films besides SAN FRANCISCO . Within two years of this film Warner Brothers produced THE SISTERS starring Bette Davis and Errol Flynn , in which Davis survives the earthquake . There was at least on silent film dealing with the earthquake too . But SAN FRANCISCO is the best known . I find it good as an entertaining film , and mediocre as a study of the actual events of April 18 - 25 , 1906 . The performances of Gable , MacDonald , Tracy , Ralph , and Jack Holt are all good . Al Shean gives a nice cameo as a musician who champions MacDonald . Even Ted Healy is less obnoxious here - he has a good dying scene . The most interesting thing about the film is the way the focus of villainy keeps shifting between Gable and Holt . We know that Clark Gable's Blackie is the hero of the film , but he frequently acts like an antihero in pushing aside MacDonald's operatic ambitions . We know that Holt is Gable's ruthless business rival , and the leader of the money people who refuse to consider fireproofing the buildings of the Barbary Coast area ( it's not economical ) . But he does love MacDonald , and can't believe Gable's totally selfish intention to keep her working in his saloon rather than putting her in her proper spot on the stage of the San Francisco opera home . This seesaw effect is usually not noted by critics of the film . It is actually a plus in keeping one's interest in the actual plot . My carping criticism is of a typically historical nature . The best study of the earthquake is Gordon Thomas and Max Gordon Witt's THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE , which points out the huge amount of official corruption in the background of the earthquake . The city was run by Boss Abe Ruef and his mayor-stooge-partner , Eugene Schmitz ( a former bassoon player in an orchestra ) . They ignored improving the fire department's equipment , and as a result the earthquake would touch off a fire that was impossible to control . The fire was only stopped when federal troops under General Frederick Funston took over the city , set up martial law ( possibly going too far - there were too many reports of killings done to prevent looting but that killed innocent people ) , and using dynamite to blast holes into the paths of the flames . Some aspects of this are shown in the earthquake sequences , but Schmitz and Ruef were not mentioned , nor was Funston ( a war hero - he helped end the Phillippine "" Insurrection of 1899 - 1902 "" by capturing Emilio Aguinaldo , it's leader , by a trick ) . Also more recent studies show the extent of the damage of the earthquake was greater than admitted in 1906 . For years the casualty rate was estimated as only 500 ( roughly the same as the Chicago Fire in 1871 and one third of the Titanic ) . About a decade ago a more careful study of census information , etc . showed the death toll was between 3 , 500 to 6 , 000 , making it one of the deadliest events in American history . The city of San Francisco did resurrect and rebuild itself quickly after the quake and fire . Ruef was sent to jail and Schmitz sent packing . San Francisco held World Fairs in 1915 and 1939-40 . It is a most beloved city for tourists on our west coast to this day . But they know , with their San Andreas Fault nearby to remind them , that it will inevitably happen again one day . They are better prepared , but it will happen , and it will be a bad day once more when it does .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Bogey's character is Sherry Scott , the man who runs WUBC , a radio station whose program lineup is losing listeners . The owner Bertram Reynolds ( Robert Middlemass ) , is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station , but hides behind his decisions by pawning them off on Scott . In an effort to boost the audience base and revenues , Reynolds has the idea of reviving a twenty year old murder case , and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play . Scott enlists the aid of Dr . Martin Leavenworth ( Harry Hayden ) to write the play and present it on the air . The Pembroke Murder case involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband , the circumstances of which are not made clear . However Gloria Pembroke has married , and is now living as Martha Carstairs ( Helen MacKellar ) , married to a successful banker ( Henry O'Neill ) , and their daughter Edith ( Linda Perry ) is about to be married ( on the same day no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke ) . About to be faced with the devastating effects of this revelation , Martha and Jim Carstairs embark on a crusade to have the program stopped . Simultaneously , Edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that the marriage not take place . Without revealing the final outcome , the film takes a devastating turn to jolt the viewer . Edith Carstairs confronts the principals of the radio station , vigorously admonishing Scott and the sniveling Reynolds . While accepting his share of the blame for the outcome , Scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job , firing his secretary , and hauling her out of the office , recognizing her for the conscience he once had . With an entirely abrupt finish , the film leaves one as disoriented and unsettled as any movie that doesn't have a happy ending . With about a dozen films under his belt , Humphrey Bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with intriguing results . With no name supporting players , Bogey rises to the occasion by taking charge in the confines of the radio offices , and runs the show as if it was his own . In an interesting bit of characterization , he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over his bowed head , predating by a half dozen years a similar effect we'll see him do in "" Casablanca "" . For Bogart fans , it's a genuine treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this .","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Don't get me wrong , I didn't like it either , but I've seen a lot worse . It's a slasher comedy , although it needs way , way more comedy . I found it to be more adequate as a slasher flick , a slasher flick with a few amusing jokes tacked on . The plot involves a serial killer on a rampage on a Costa Rican resort island . This resort is owned by Coconut Pete , a clone of Jimmy Buffet . This character amused me a lot . As performers , the members of Broken Lizard ( and , by the way , I don't know which actors qualify as part of this troupe ) do have talent , but they seriously need to learn how to write a movie script .

Text2: If you're a big fan of the mad German genius Werner Herzog , you might be disappointed in this , his first foray into Hollywood film-making . This is polished and not at all experimental . However , to me it feels like Herzog , when he stepped up to the plate , said to himself , "" Well , I can make an American film . And I can make a better one than 95 % of American films . "" And there's nothing wrong with that . The film is a dramatization of the events retold in Herzog's earlier documentary Little Dieter Needs to Fly . Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler , an American citizen and German emigré who had one of the most impressive survival instincts ever seen in a human being . Shot down in Laos in the opening throes of the Vietnam War , he was taken to a brutal POW camp where he met two other American POWs ( Jeremy Davies and Steven Zahn in the film ) and three Asian men who had worked with the enemy . The two Americans had been there for an average of a couple of years , and had all but given up hope ( the Davies character is sure there will be peace soon enough ) . Through his amazing ingenuity , Dieter planned a heroic escape . Most of the movie takes place in the POW camp . Most of what I remember from Little Dieter Needs to Fly , which I saw around two years ago , is the escape . It's a disturbing , horrifying tale of survival . I would have liked this part to be the longer , but it works very well . It's certainly harrowing . I was disappointed that one of the images I really remember from the original film did not appear : the bear that stalked Dieter during his final days wandering in the jungle . He considered it almost a friend , but in the back of his mind realized it was following him because it wanted to eat him . Herzog keeps things extremely subtle , telling them very much the way they happened . The story develops more like real life , not like a movie . It keeps melodrama to a minimum . My only problem is how it ends . The ending is way too boisterous and uplifting . Dieter Dengler was most definitely an upbeat kind of guy , but his suffering and the awful things that he saw ? heck , with the awful things that we just experienced with him , so vivid is this movie ? don't lead well to the celebration that ends the movie . I very much liked this film , and think it is one of the best I've seen so far this year .","{""output"": ""YES""}"

But once you get past the look of the movie you realize how trite the story is . The thing I got out of it that disturbed me was that meat eaters are bad and vegetarians are good .

Text2: first there was the original x-men movie . OK so this was to tell the story of the x-men . which to be frank was pretty boring . and had the worst line in cinema history ( the line what storm says to toad just before hi demise . something like ' you know what happens to a toad when it is struck by lightning ? . . the same as everything else ' ! ! ! then x-men united came out which was better but with spider man being released the year before , just didn't really cut the mustard . BUT . . . when these films are viewed together , they make great viewing , the characters are very in depth and intense and you actually sympathise with these ' mutants ' . now to the last stand . maybe the best of the three , but the best for pure spectacle . Ratner has directed this , when i heard he was to be the helmer , i did have reservations , as this is the guy who really made Chris tucker a big big star . what ratner has done has made a film for the public and fanboys alike . it's not advisable to watch this as a standalone feature as you will be lost in the plot , and the host of characters that are involved . then there are the characters . a lot of the characters are pushed back or disposed of quite quickly to involve the four main characters . namely , wolverine , phoenix / jean grey , magneto and storm ( even though i do not believe that storm is integral to the plot , maybe she should have been killed at the lake instead of cyclops ) . then there are the characters who are pushed aside . really the only one who this happens to is rogue , who was really a vital part to the last 2 movies , here she is shown to be a believer of the cure and that is really all she does in the movie . then there is mystique , again someone who was vital ( and fun ) in the previous two , again pushed aside for no reason at all and unfortunately wasted in the movie . these are pushed aside for the new characters . the main addition here is of the beast , a secretary for the mutants who has brains as well as brawn . Kelsey grammar is tremendous in this role and it shows he has been watching old episodes of Frasier to prepare him for the role . but in true comic book style , he does kick butt toward the end . i feel that angel was wasted as he was in a prologue at the beginning but alas we never see a lot of action from him and poor Ben foster only has a handful of lines . juggernaut is the only mutant that lets the brotherhood down . Vinnie Jones should stick to playing typecast gangsters than appearing in films like this . for the film itself , the story is good if not solid , the script is funny and fast moving , and there are some nasty surprises along the way for those who are not in the know . the special effects are groundbreaking too . OK everyone will be raving on about the golden gate bridge scene , which is impressive , but for me , it's right at the beginning where the fx team have made magneto and Xavier appear twenty years younger . amazing . this film may not be to everyones taste , and there will be fanboys who will moan at the style , but if like me you like comic books , but are not obsessed and are not really bothered by minor changes to characters , then you will be in for a treat . this is really the first hit of the summer in an otherwise really season of letdown movies . just one little gripe about the movie . after the moving of golden gate bridge , it suddenly becomes night time for no reason , which does really stand out ( i think this was intentional though to make the action more intense ) . and stay after the credits , there is little treat there for fans","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: ( Some slight Spoilers ) Well acted and written story about the heart-breaking loneliness of being abandoned at a very young age and how it's shapes the mind to the point of conjuring up a twisted sort of pseudo-vengeance and false sense of justice on the part of the person effected . Sophie Hartley has been going through very hard and stressful times of late with her mothers unexpected death and having to look after her elderly father . But Sophie's job as a writer and illustrator of children books of-sets them keeping her mind focused on her work . Happily married to Craig with two cute and loving daughters Anna & Ruby Sophie is getting over her moms death until a number of strange things start to happen to her . things which she later strongly suspects are being orchestrated by her new next door neighbors wife , or live in girlfriend , Mara . Mara for her part is at the time working for Sophie's husband Caig , an architect , as his assistant which has Sophie strongly suspect that she's trying to steal Craig away from her . Beautiful but somewhat on the weird side Mara seems to be mimicking Sophie In everything that she does . Even wearing the same cloths that in one case when one of her dresses go missing , Sophie suspects that she stole from her home . Slowly being driven insane Sophie falls behind in her work and almost causes her daughter Ruby to overdose on cough medicine . Because her mind is so out of focus over her fear of Mara and what Mara is trying to do to her and her family . It later turns out that Mara is indeed interested in Craig and pulls out all stops one evening in his office just about throwing herself at him . With Craig at first reluctantly then gladly giving in to her advances . Sophie for her part has become so obsessed with Mara that she sneaks into her home , looking for items that she suspects Mara of stealing from her , and is arrested for breaking and entering . At her trial Sophie is ordered by the presiding judge to stay as far as 500 yards away from Mara , and her boyfriends Jimmy's , home . Losing her mind and not caring what happens to her Sophie again breaks into Mara's place looking for the family cat who was seen there and is trapped , by Mara , in the basement . This happened as both of Shphie's children , Anna & Ruby , are upstairs playing and dancing together with Mara . Trying to break out Sophie looking through a number of personal effects of Mara stored there in the basement sees the real reason for her violent dislike of her and why she's going to such great lengths to hurt and even kill Sophie . Which leads to the final and fiery confrontation between the two with both of them ending up in the hospital emergency ward . The really big surprise comes at the very end of the movie when you think that you've already found out the reasons for Mara's strange and unstable behavior . And it's about as shocking , as well as surprising , as anything you'll ever see in a surprise-ending film . Susan Sarandon and Sam Neill as Sophie and Craig Hartley are excellent as the befuddled and targeted , by Mara , couple who have no idea to what's happening to them throughout the entire movie . with Emily Blunt as the cunning and manipulative Mara pulling all the strings and driving both of them out of their minds and in the case of Sophie almost into prison or a mental institution . It's without a doubt the ending to "" Irrisistable "" that's so effective yet cryptic , that you have to watch it twice to really figure it out .

1051,"Text1: If anyone follows my reviews one will note that I always use the expression hero / heel when talking about Tyrone Power . He could be a full blooded hero or he was a hero / heel , a likable sort of guy , but one who was ruthless in getting what he wanted . You need someone of Power's ability and charm to play such a part . And sad to say that was something Stephen Boyd just doesn't bring to The Oscar . Even when one is an anti-hero there has to be certain qualities brought out that make you root for the guy . Two minutes into watching The Oscar and I wanted to punch out Stephen Boyd . This guy is all heel with no charm and uses people like toilet paper . Joseph E . Levine assembled quite a cast to support Boyd and I don't think I've ever seen so much talent squandered on such a mediocre picture . Try counting the number of Oscar winners in it . Just Edith Head's Oscars and she plays herself in the film must bring the total to over 20 . She got a nomination here for costume design , one of two The Oscar got , the second was for Art & Set design . Tony Bennett is the hero's best friend who is similarly used and abused doesn't give a half bad performance and this was to be a breakthrough for him as a dramatic actor like Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra . I also liked Milton Berle as his agent . Some of the women in Boyd's life in this film are Eleanor Parker , Elke Sommer , and Jill St . John . The one I liked best was Jean Hale as a star who the up and coming Boyd is sent on a publicity date with . She's a female version of him so there is one great moment where she gets dumped on literally . One woman who was in Stephen Boyd's life and who always tried to promote his career in her column appears her as herself in one of her last appearances . Rumor has it that Boyd made old Hedda Hopper's life particularly memorable in her golden years . In the old My Favorite Martian series there was an episode where Ray Walston uses a special light bulb in the room and it gives off a benevolence bulb . You just become inexplicably likable to all around . Bill Bixby sees this as a great way to score with women and he uses it . But Walston tells him that on earthlings it gives you a hate me glow and the two spend the rest of the episode trying to find the antidote . That's what Boyd projected here , a two hour hate me glow . And in fact this review is dedicated to an attorney I knew back in Brooklyn , a man who had ambitions for a great political career , but had a hate me glow that made Boyd look like Albert Schweitzer . No names of course , but Ronald J . D'Angelo this film is for you . The Oscar is a campy all star look at an ambitious actor and if you can stand the hate me glow that Boyd projects , you'll like looking at the stars .

Text2: Private Eye Sam Campbell is hired by the estranged husband of a woman whose father he's accused of killing . With a few good plot twists , he uncovers the real murderer and the reason behind that and two other subsequent killings . Don't pass up an opportunity to see character actor Jerome Cowan for once in the lead . His most noted role in film was also a detective as Sam Spade's luckless partner Miles Archer in the Maltese Falcon . In that film he was a lady's man whose hormones got him killed . Here he's quite the ladies man as well , but his mind as it turns out is on business first . Cowan's main squeeze in this film is Jane Wyman . She played a lot of molls before she got real roles of substance later in the decade , culminating with that Oscar for Johnny Belinda . It's interesting to see her in these roles sometimes though . Of the supporting cast the biggest kudos go to Cy Kendall who was the hapless sheriff . It's a running truism in Hollywood that in these detective stories , the police always get shown up by the private eye . Sometimes the cops are smart , but the private eye is smarter and sometimes they're downright dumb . It's the latter here . This film is an enjoyable product from Warner's B film unit .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
1052,"Text1: The title of this German film translates as ' The Emperor of California ' , so - - when I first heard of this movie - - I thought it would be a dramatisation of the bizarre true story of Joshua Norton , an eccentric beggar in 19th-century San Francisco who declared himself Emperor of the United States . This movie turns out to be inspired by the life of a 19th-century historic figure , right enough , but it isn't Joshua Norton : it's John Sutter ( or Johann Suter ) , the immigrant on whose land was discovered ( in 1848 ) the gold ore that led to the California Gold Rush . I'm extremely impressed with this film . It was clearly made on a large budget , and several exterior sequences were actually filmed in California . Most of the cast give excellent , well-directed performances . I'm slightly familiar with the life story of the real John Sutter . This German movie varies somewhat from the facts ( as does Hollywood , constantly ) , but much of the rewriting here actually serves to make Sutter's life story more plausible , rather than less . It's not widely known that the real John Sutter's emigration to California was by an extremely circuitous path that took him through Hawaii and Alaska ! But that trivium is ultimately irrelevant to the part of his story that really matters ( the gold strike , and its aftermath ) , so Sutter's peregrinations are wisely left out here . ' The Kaiser of California ' won Italy's Mussolini Cup as best foreign ( non-Italian ) film of the year . This means both good news and bad news . In order to win the Mussolini Cup , a film had to be genuinely well-made , featuring excellent photography , intelligent scripting , superlative performances . This movie has those assets in abundance . The bad news is that - - as you might guess from its patron's name - - the Mussolini Cup was ideologically motivated . To be worthy of that award , a film had to advance Fascist agenda . Which this movie , indeed , does . At every point where I spotted a deviation from historical truth in this movie , the deviation was always to the benefit of totalitarian ( and anti-American ) politics . To begin with , the real John Sutter ( or Johann Suter ) was Swiss . When he founded a homestead in Spanish California , he cried it Nueva Helvetia : New Switzerland . In this movie , Johann Suter ( not John Sutter ) retains his German birthname throughout his life , and he identifies himself as German ( not Swiss ) to his dying day . In the time of the Anschluss , I can understand why Nazi filmmakers would want to blur the distinctions between Germans , Austrians and Swiss . The basic nugget of historic truth is retained : when gold is discovered on Suter's land , his homestead is ruined by prospectors . Others make fortunes in the goldfields while Suter ends his days in poverty . The last reel of this film shows Suter shrieking on the steps of a U . S . courthouse , cursing the American politicians who have cheated him . The truth is more complicated . In real life , the U . S . Congress voted to compensate John Sutter very generously for the loss of his land . . . but he died before the compensation could commence . Also , John Sutter's real-life son August amassed a fortune in the boom economy triggered by the Gold Rush . ( The son selfishly refused to share the wealth with his father . ) In this film , Johann Suter has a fictional son Rudolph who bears almost no resemblance to the real August Sutter . For that matter , the name of Suter's wife has been arbitrarily changed from Nanette ( a Swiss name ) to the more German-sounding Anna . The injustices heaped upon Suter throughout this movie are presented as semi-official actions of the United States government , rather than what they actually were : depredations caused by greedy individuals . This movie stands as solid evidence that , as far back as 1936 , the German film ministry were trying to stir up German-language audiences against the United States . ' The Kaiser of California ' is anti-U . S . pro-Nazi propaganda , but it manages to be fairly subtle in its intentions : there is , of course , no explicit mention of Nazism nor Hitler . Since this movie achieves its intentions very proficiently , I'll rate it , with a footnote warning viewers to proceed with caution . P . S . : In real life , but not in this movie , some of the prospectors in the California Gold Rush were from Australia . One of them noticed that the land near Sutter's Mill bore a strong resemblance to the land near his own homestead in Kalgoorlie , Australia : after panning out his claim in California , this man went back home to Kalgoorlie and struck gold . Few Americans know that there was a gold rush in Australia immediately after the one in California . I hope that somebody will eventually make a film about the Kalgoorlie Gold Rush ; it's a fascinating story .

Text2: I started out disliking ' A Fitting Tribute ' because the premise reminded me of one of the most uncomfortable events in my adult life . In 1975 , I was a stringer for one of the Fleet Street tabloids . An attractive young heiress named Lesley Whittle was kidnapped and held to ransom by a psychopath who eventually murdered her . My editor ordered me to go to the Whittle home and obtain a photograph of the dead heiress , even though her grieving family presumably had other priorities at the moment . As I was leaving the editor's desk , he shouted after me : ' Try to get her in a swimming cozzie . ' Fortunately , ' A Fitting Tribute ' goes off in an entirely different direction from my own experiences on that unpleasant occasion . ' A Fitting Tribute ' begins in a rural cemetery , where we meet shrewish Tammy and gormless Niall . They get into a car , and Tammy drives while she harangues Niall . There's some plot exposition here , and director Daniel Cormack handles it expertly : he shoots close-ups of Tammy's eyes in the rear-view mirror ( presumably from Niall's P . O . V . ) while her off-screen voice delivers the set-up . Apparently Niall is a cub reporter , and Tammy ( a more experienced journo ) is ordering him to the home of a young man who has recently died in a road accident , with the objective of obtaining a photograph of the deceased . We never do learn why this young man is important enough to merit so much journalistic intrigue ; perhaps Tammy and Niall are working for a regional newspaper that specialises in local events . Niall goes to the house of Mrs Wright , the deceased's mother . Surprisingly enough , she lets him in and hears him out . What happens next is utterly unexpected , bizarre , yet believable . I shan't spoil the ending for you , except to say that it reminded me of Roald Dahl's classic story ' The Landlady ' . . . but with a far more benevolent fate befalling the young protagonist in this case . There's a darkly clever pun in this film's title : ' A Fitting Tribute ' . There are only three characters in this mini-drama ( we never do see the dead son ) , but all three actors give excellent well-modulated performances . As the grieving mother , April Nicholson could have brought her characterisation into bathos but blessedly never does so . It's early days yet for director Daniel Cormack , but he has already distinguished himself as a talented director , both in manipulating actors and in positioning the camera . Throughout ' A Fitting Tribute ' , his shot set-ups are spot-on and well-framed . I'll rate this clever drama a full .","{""output"": ""YES""}"
