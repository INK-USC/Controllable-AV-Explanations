1,"Text1: "" The Vatican can go to hell ! "" Rubbishy low budget The Exorcist rip-off that's thirty five years too late . Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle ( Kristin Erickson ) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood . Her parents Ely ( Randy Colton ) & Blanche ( Leslie Fleming-Mitchell ) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter , recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's . Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel ( Del Zamora ) recognises Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it . Blanche calls priest Jacob ( Cameron Daddo ) who is her other daughter Claire's ( Madison Taylor ) ex husband to see Isabelle , he confirms Miguel's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle & an innocent girl free . . . Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over & over again , why do I do it . Why do I keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder ? Right lets honest about this , Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of The Exorcist ( 1973 ) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share . There's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things , the demon that uses past misdemeanour's against other's , the worried parents , the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's , the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things . I suppose where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different ( other than it's total crap ) is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring . The film starts with Isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either , the rest of the character's are poorly written & fleshed out . At times I wondered whether Blackwater Valley exorcism was a spoof , there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a ' little prick ' he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back ! There are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect . The film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama , or it did in my opinion at least . According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on ' Actual Events ' , yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called The Exorcist . . . This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest . There isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up , there's a scene of a cut arm , there's a dead dog , someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that's about it . There's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive . I would imagine the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast's are seen . One pair of naked female breast's is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it . There is zero scares , no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 000 , 000 I must say that I am wondering where all the money went , the film looks ugly & cheap throughout . There are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom . The acting is very poor from all involved , genre favourite Jeffrey Combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time . Even he must have feared how

This sequel picks up four weeks after the first , and clumsy , fat ( she put on quite a bit of weight ) and insecure Bridget Jones ( Golden Globe nominated Ren√©e Zellweger ) has human rights lawyer Mark Darcy ( Colin Firth ) . They do start to squabble after a while , both about small things ( like how Mark folds his pants ) and a possible affair with Rebecca ( Jacinda Barrett ) ( and it turns out she is a lesbian in love with Bridget ) , and they break up . During this break up Mark disappears somewhere , and Bridget has a fling with her past lover who has returned , working on TV , Daniel Cleaver ( Hugh Grant ) , and they go to Thailand to do filming . Bridget on the way home does get involved in a drug smuggling incident which makes her go to prison , but there is a happy ending , after Mark and Daniel's second fight , when Mark asks Bridget for marriage , and she accepts . Also starring Jim Broadbent as Bridget's dad , Gemma Jones as Bridget's mum , Smack the Pony's Sally Phillips as Sharon / Shazzer , Shirley Henderson as Jude , James Callis as Tom , Jessica Stevenson / Hynes as Magda , Neil Pearson as Richard Finch , Ace Ventura 2's Ian McNeice as Quizmaster , Celia Imrie as Una Alconbury and Jeremy Paxman . The sentimentality of the film seems more constant than the laughs , and it does not have much reference to Bridget's diary , but there one or two giggly moments , e . g . Bridget getting soaked twice by puddles . Okay !

2,"Text1: Visually a great movie with great performances . "" The Madness of King George "" is far from an excellent movie and a must see but nevertheless it's still both fun and wonderful to watch . The costumes and sets are great and Sir Nigel Hawthorne really carries the movie with his wonderful performance . The movie is more of a comedy than a drama really . The movie is filled with some humorous moments , dialogs and characters . Only problem I had with the movie was that it focused on way too many and unneeded characters . Also because of this , Sir Ian Holm's character gets seriously underused . A bit of an ungrateful role for Sir Ian Holm . They could have used his acting skills in a better manner . Basically the movie is just a little bit over 1 hour and 40 minutes of fun entertainment with some nice humor and an impressive Sir Nigel Hawthorne .


Text2: Great and interesting WW II propaganda movie . This American WW II time propaganda movie tells about the invention of the jeep and the everyday use of it by the American army during WW II . The end result is an interesting to watch short film , that also works quite well educational . Not trying to sound like a big history buff but I know quite a lot about WW II and its weapons and vehicles of its time . Nevertheless , it wasn't until this film that I really fully started to realize - and appreciate the importance of the jeep and what a quite revolutionary invention it was , for its time . Let's face it , without WW II the jeep would had probably not had been invented for another 10 or 15 years . War always brings new inventions , that are revolutionary and in many ways ahead of its time . The jeep is really one of those revolutionary war-time inventions . This short film shows the jeep in full action and shows for what purposes it all can be used by the army . I still learned some things I didn't knew yet . It all is told and explained from the point of view of the jeep itself . It might sound childish perhaps but it works really well . Instead of having a 30 minutes + long documentary with lots of talking , this is a fast paced only 9 minutes short documentary that tells you everything you really want to know and it does this in a rather light and amusing way , without ever loosing any of its informing and educational value . The short running time and its pace also makes sure that it keeps you interested for its entire duration . The film also features a whole lot of military , royal and Hollywood celebrities driving the jeep , to once more - and to extra point out the importance , reliability and usefulness of the vehicle . Great light educational , little short , WW II-time film .

3,"Text1: Humphrey Bogart and a load of dead prostitutes . . . you've got to love Giallo ! Despite the fact that this Giallo is often lambasted , I actually had rather high hopes for it ; just due to the sheer number of cult names on the cast list and the fact that the more convoluted Giallo's are often the best . However , while this film does have a vast array of ideas on display , director Ferdinando Merighi isn't able to round everything up into one coherent plot line . Furthermore , not many of the genre trademarks have made it into the film ; as it's not very colourful , the mystery is obvious from the beginning and despite the fact that the plot focuses on a brothel ; there isn't a great deal of nudity . The film gets off to a good start , and after the first half hour I was really expecting a more than decent Giallo . We are introduced to Antoine Gottvalles ; a customer at the aforementioned brothel . He's in love with prostitute Francine ( the gorgeous Barbara Bouchet , whom I'm in love with ) and after her murder , he becomes the prime suspect while the real killer manages to escape . It's not long before the murders continue and police inspector / Humphrey Bogart look-alike Inspector Pontaine gets on the case . The cast list is among the most impressive of any Giallo . The most exciting element for me was the fact that Amuck co-stars Rosalba Neri and Barbara Bouchet were reunited , even if the latter does only last a few minutes . ' Killer Nun ' Anita Ekberg gets a supporting role alongside ' Dr Orloff ' Howard Vernon , while the film introduces the lovely Evelyn Kraft . The film is rounded off by a bizarre performance from professional Humphrey Bogart look-alike Robert Sacchi . Quite why the Inspector looks like Bogey is never actually explained ; my theory is that it either has something to do with the alternate title ( Bogeyman and the French Murders ) , or director Ferdinando Merighi really wanted Bogart in his movie , but couldn't get him . . . for obvious reasons . The problem with Sacci in the lead is that , unfortunately , he can't act . . . and he doesn't look that much like Bogart anyway . The plot manages to move along without getting too dry despite being highly derivative , and the film does have a number of standout death scenes ; even if they are extremely unprofessional in their handling . The Parisian setting is good and provides a little beauty to offset the mundane plot . The ending is a little obvious . . . but it's fun enough to watch and overall , I won't say that The French Sex Murders is a great example of the Giallo . . . but it just about qualifies as a decent one .


Text2: Nothing on Silence of the Lambs and the novel it's based on , but a decent thriller in it's own right . After the return of the infamous Hannibal Lecter to our screens in 2001 with Ridley Scott's film version of the best novel in Thomas Harris's Lecter trilogy , it's not surprising that a new version of the first novel in the series got an update a year later considering that it's previous screen version , Michael Mann's Manhunter , doesn't fit in with the other two films in the series . I do have to say that this version is both more true to Harris ' novel and an overall better film than Manhunter ; though it does have numerous shortfalls and has nothing on the masterpiece ' Silence of the Lambs ' . The plot is quite similar to the one in Silence of the Lambs , and features a cop on the hunt of a serial killer and receiving help from the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter . FBI Agent Will Graham , the captor of Hannibal Lecter , is called out of retirement to help catch a serial killer dubbed "" The Tooth Fairy "" by the media . The killer has already slaughtered two families and the FBI believes that another one is soon to join them ; meaning that Will Graham has no choice but to ask Hannibal Lecter for help with the case . The casting is one of the things that many critics pick up on , and that's not surprising . Anthony Hopkins effortlessly slips back into the role that he will always be associated with ; although he's far more comical here than in previous Lecter films . As anyone who has read the book will tell you , Edward Norton is completely wrong for the role of Will Graham as the role needed a grittier actor . Harvey Keitel is a great actor , but Scott Glenn from Silence of the Lambs fit the role of Jack Crawford much better . There's nothing wrong with the rest of the supporting cast , however , with Ralph Fiennes , Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman all fit into their respective roles well . There's not a great deal wrong with the plot pacing , although the film is a little slow at times and the book is much more exciting on the whole . Certain parts of the plot could have been cut out to streamline the film for the screen , although Ted Tally's screenplay is good in that it does encompass most of the important parts of the book . Obviously this film is always going to come under criticism for not being as great as Silence of the Lambs and it does have nothing on the book , but overall Red Dragon is a decent enough thriller in it's own right and I cant say I dislike it .

4,"Text1: well-acted and very watchable - - though probably NOT for every taste It seems to me that this movie was made as an attack on the death penalty . While I have no problem with the use of the death penalty , I strongly agree with the major contention of the film . That is , once a person is sentenced , by the time they are put to death a lot of time has passed and they may not be the same person - - and may no longer deserve to die . In the case of the film , the delay was BRIEF compared to our modern penal system , as the delay looked to be about two years . During this interim time , the convicted man did so much to help those around him that there was little will , except among some idiots in the local government , to execute him . The film is very interesting and gives us insight into life on the isolated island of St . Pierre ( a French possession near New Foundland ) and because the story , it seems , is based on a true story ! I liked the film because it dared to be different , had something to say and featured excellent acting and dialog - - and this combination definitely doesn't happen very often .


Text2: Keaton is in top form I just wrote a review for STEAMBOAT BILL , JR . and that makes this review VERY difficult , because I really can't decide which of these two films is better . To me , they are both nearly perfect and represent the best full-length material Keaton performed - - at least when it comes to stunts and laughs . It's sad really , as just after these two triumphs came the sound era - - and a seriously negative down-turn in Keaton's career , as MGM repeatedly gave him terrible material - - pairing him with the brash and inappropriate humor of Jimmy Durante . This film is probably the best of his films when it comes to concept and consistency of the humor and plot . It really never lags and is both exciting and funny throughout . And , for once , I have nothing critical to say about the film . No matter how many times I see it , it just seems perfect . This might just be my favorite silent comedy - - period . It's that good . By the way , while all is practically perfect in every way about this film , this is NOT my favorite Keaton full-length film . While not as funny or filled with amazing stunts , OUR HOSPITALITY is an amazing film for its artistry . In addition to being the prettiest of his films , it also features among the best characterization for Keaton - - with a full and rich plot . My advice is to see THE GENERAL and OUR HOSPITALITY and see two very different and probably equally great films from a master .

5,"Text1: Some funny parts , more stupid parts . It should be noted that stupid parts are often funny , too , I still haven't figured out what it is exactly that makes one stupid scene funny and another one just stupid and vulgar . The mashed potato scene in Scary Movie 2 , for example , was not funny by any stretch of the imagination . If you really liked that , you should try hanging out in a mental hospital or a physical therapy ward or something , you will be in absolute hysterics . Then again , I loved the Ace Ventura films , and stupidity is the foundation for most of the successful comedy in it , at least to me . Now , when I watch a comedy like Dodgeball , clearly I am looking at the ratio to stupid scenes that don't work and stupid scenes that work . Dodgeball had more of the former . The story is about a regular guy who owns a gym and an obscenely rich and snobby guy who owns a massive gym across the street from him and who spends not a little bit of time trying to run the average guy out of business . Thhe initial problem that I had was that Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller are very different actors , not the least reason for which is that Vaughn can play characters as different as the characters he played in Clay Pigeons and The Cell , whereas Stiller plays exactly the same character in every movie , he only seems to alter how irritating his characters are ( think Meet the Parents vs . his character here ) . Then again , he capitalizes on his weaknesses , kind of like David Spade . But in the movie , Vaughn reminds me of a guy dealing with some drunken jerk at a party , trying to shrug off his ridiculous and embarrassing behavior but eventually giving in and knocking the guy on his ass . Stiller is so over the top that there is no way to take him any more seriously than as a comic book villain . He is tiring to watch before the first third of the movie is over . There are effective gags in the movie , it is not all bad . The plot is fun to watch , because not only is White Goodman ( Stiller ) annoying to watch , but he is also a complete jerk , so you really want to root for the underdogs , and the movie makes very sure that you see them as underdogs in every way imaginable . But it should be noted that the best scene in the movie involves Vince Vaughn at the airport , having given up on his team , when he runs into someone that I won't reveal . They have a normal conversation , no over-the-top antics , and it's the funniest thing in the movie . Then again , maybe I just thought so because I enjoy ridiculously long bike rides .


Text2: Mercury sinking ? Okay , before you condemn Mercury Rising for being what it admittedly is , a cheesy action movie , you should at least consider that it accomplishes what it sets out to do . This movie was obviously never meant to win any Academy Awards ( otherwise they wouldn't have cast Bruce Willis , at least at that stage in his career ) , but it does have some effective action sequences . The problem that I have with the movie is not that it fails as an action movie , but that it could have been so much better . The good action sequences are padded with at least as many awful ones , and there was plenty of thought put into about 5 % of the story , while the rest is on auto-pilot . There is a great opening action scene where Arthur Jeffries ( Bruce Willis ) plays an undercover FBI agent acting as a robber in an effort to end a bank robbery safely , before the trigger-happy cops outside suddenly decide to open massive fire , completely unprovoked by anything except the passage of time . What follows is one of those endlessly satisfying scenes where the angry hero stomps out to the official in charge who's stupid decision resulted in the deaths of all those bank robbers , criminal or not , as he defies all ranking by smacking him in the face with his pistol , although I can't help wishing that he had done something even more . Unfortunately , this is one of the most satisfying scenes in the movie , which goes gradually downhill from here until the end . Miko Hughes , one of American's beloved child actors who can actually act , adds to his already extensive filmography with his portrayal of Simon Lynch , an autistic boy who loves puzzles a little too much . Autism is presented in a fairly straightforward manner , although the potential for massive intellectual processing is hugely enhanced and milked for all it's worth here . The problem with the movie is that it takes an enormously unlikely scenario related to autism and makes and entire film out of it . Simon has cracked a government super-code that was placed deep within a puzzle in a ' geek's puzzle magazine ' to test it's durability , and when he manages to decipher and call the secret phone number , all hell breaks loose . And by ' all hell , ' of course , I mean the rest of the goofy plot of the movie . The film starts off presenting an intelligent story about national security , until we realize that this is a code that they spent billions of dollars on without bothering to explain where those dollars went . This may be something that I just don't know , but what is it about a code that costs billions of dollars to make ? Is it the two guys in the little computer room who charge too much for their services ? Are the rates for Federal Hitmen getting out of control ? This is where the movie really slips , by the way . Instead of simply admitting that there is obviously a problem with the code , which can be solved by a 9-year-old boy , autistic or not , and then setting about changing the code , the FBI agents involved literally turn into murderers , sending out a hit man , black gloves and all , to murder the boy and his parents , erasing him from existence and then hoping no one ever asks any questions . The action in Mercury Rising succeeds , for the most part ( except for some awful blue-screen scenes , like the one between the trains ) , but it has enormous problems on a foundational level . Some stuff succeeds ( I rather enjoyed the scene in the wine cellar , but even this is founded on a movie with an unstable premise . I think that Roger Ebert pointed this out best at the end of his review when he says that if a billion dollar code can be cracked by an autistic boy , don't kill the boy , kill the programmers .

Elaborate , star-studded and very good-looking movie . It did keep me entertained BUT it's a very bad adaptation of "" The Front Page "" .

This movie "" updates "" the dialogue ( that means throwing in swearing ) , adds some really crude jokes and throws in unnecessary slapstick sequences . As some other posters have mentioned this movie is VERY loud - - too loud . The cast does what they can - - Matthau is horrible but doesn't destroy the movie ; Lemmon , although too old for the role , is just great ; Sarandon is shamefully wasted ( but she was unknown when she did this ) ; Carol Burnett is ( surprisingly ) not that good as a prostitute ( yes - - you read that right - - Carol Burnett plays a prostitute ) ; Austin Pendleton is letter-perfect as Earl Williams ; Vincent Gardenia explodes and yells ( a lot ) as the sheriff and Harold Gould ( wisely ) underplays the part of the mayor .

Text2: Top notch film noir Scott Henderson ( Alan Curtis ) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife . The night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name . After accused of the murder , the police visit all the places he had been with her , but people only remember him being alone . He's sentenced to die and his secretary ( Ella Raines ) sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves him . This was made as a B film from Universal ( look at the cast - - all character actors and one star - - Franchot Tone - - on the decline ) . The budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the 1940s . It's beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by William Irish ( a pen name for Cornell Woolrich ) . It moves quickly and just looks fantastic . And there's the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr . which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy ( I'm surprised the censors didn't cut it ) . There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect . Tone gives a dreadful performance . He looks ghastly and he's just horrible . Also Curtis is stiff and bland as Henderson . You really wonder why Raines loves him - - he's so unemotional . But Raines is pretty good in the lead role . She's pretty and full of life . Also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true . He's hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstated . Still I'm giving this a 9 . A really great film - - flaws aside .

7,"Text1: Laughton on canvas Charles Laughton returned to his native Great Britain in 1936 for three years and made a series of films there . The first and best of these was for Alexander Korda about Rembrandt Van Rijn , arguably the greatest of all Dutch painters . Later biographical pictures , Lust for Life about Van Gogh and Moulin Rouge about Toulouse-Lautrec had good location photography going for them . Alexander Korda did create some nice sets to depict the Netherlands of the 17th century , but it just isn't the same . Another difference between Rembrandt and the other two later pictures is while Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec died young , Rembrandt lived to be an old man by the standards of his century . The film takes us on a forty year journey of his life from the death of his first wife until just before he dies . Laughton is great at capturing Rembrandt at every stage of his life . As compared to those other two 19th century artists , Rembrandt's life was also not the tormented one the others had . Rembrandt is not a deformed cripple like Toulouse-Lautrec nor is he dealing with the onset of mental illness like Van Gogh . Tragedy happens in his life , but the tragedy isn't out of his own character . Like the other two Rembrandt was constantly plagued with money problems . That's actually what takes up most of the film , the compromises he makes with his artistic vision and the need he has to put bread on the table . Gertrude Lawrence and Elsa Lanchester do fine as the two women in his life . Laughton and Lawrence did not get along during the making of Rembrandt , that may have helped give their scenes some real bite . Three members of the performing Livesey family are in this film and Roger Livesey is a standout as the beggar who Rembrandt uses to paint his portrait of King Saul from the Old Testament . Rembrandt is a finely crafted piece of film making and Charles Laughton gives one of his best screen performances . I wish though it had been done on location the way Lust for Life and Moulin Rouge were .

8,"Text1: Dreary There's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis . I mean it's Shakespeare's Hamlet for goodness sake ? probably one of the best known plays ever written . I'm not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people on IMDb have ? through Mystery Science Theater 3000 . While the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie , in this case I cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips . In a word , this German , made-for-TV version of Hamlet is dreary . 152 minutes ? No way ! It's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours on . I've said it any number of times , but entertainment is the thing for me . And this wrist-slitter is far from entertaining . I will , however , give it a couple of points for what I felt was some reasonably good acting . A sounds about right to me . As much as I enjoy MST3K , their comments don't help to make Hamlet any more palatable . There are a few good riffs here and there , but overall , Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K . Shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow . As much as it pains me , I've got to give Hamlet a on my MST3K rating scale .


Text2: If nothing else , it's interesting from a historical perspective Mario Bava is generally credited with creating the Giallo with his 1963 movies The Girl Who Knew Too Much and Blood and Black Lace . While a few more examples were made in the 1960s , the Giallo really took-off after Dario Argento released The Bird with the Crystal Plumage in 1970 . I mention these two dates because I think they're important when discussing 1968's The Young , the Evil & the Savage because they point how early in the Giallo cycle it falls . Yet , strangely enough , the movie feels rater tired . It's difficult for me to explain why , but I'll give it a try . Part of the problem is that even though The Young , the Evil & the Savage is an early Giallo , it's actually rather unoriginal . There's very little new ground broken in the movie . It plays like a cross between the previously mentioned Blood and Black Lace and the 1962 film Werewolf in a Girls ' Dormitory . Replace the werewolf with a mad killer and copy some of Bava's murder scenes and you've got The Young , the Evil & the Savage . Another factor that makes The Young , the Evil & the Savage feel tired is its rather staid , conservative look especially when compared with other films of the same period . There's really no comparison between this film and Lucio Fulci's One on Top of the Other made just a year later . Fulci's film has that hip , colorful , groovy feel to it that is definitely a product of the swinging 60s . To this day , it maintains its fresh and interesting look . The Young , the Evil & the Savage , on the other hand , has a feel and look to it of something much older . Visually , it has more in common with the previously mentioned 1962 film Werewolf in a Girl's Dormitory than it does something from 1968 . There are , however , a couple of reasons to see this movie . First , if you're a Giallo fan , the novelty of seeing such an early example should not be bypassed . From a historical perspective , it's an interesting film . Second , the final twist where the killer is revealed is quite well done and is easily the highlight of the movie . I'm seen a number of Gialli with underwhelming finales , so it was nice to see one where the ending was not only a winner , but the best thing about the movie . Edit : I just watched Dark Sky's new transfer of The Young , the Evil , and the Savage ( or Naked You Die ) . Gotta say it was like watching a different movie . There's nothing like have a nice looking transfer with good sound and cuts restored to make you change your mind about a movie . It's still not the best Giallo I've ever seen , but my opinion has improved . Dark Sky's transfer gave the movie some of that funkiness I thought it so desperately needed .

9,"Text1: The Pancake Batter Anomaly is one of the funniest episodes of "" The Big Bang Theory "" yet When Penny returns from her hometown in Nebraska , she tells Leonard and Sheldon that many of her immediate family had the flu . That signals Sheldon to keep away from her since he's a germaphobic . When Sheldon does get sick , Leonard decides to ditch him to watch a Planet of the Apes marathon at a cinema with Howard and Raj . So , ironically , Penny ends up taking care of Sheldon by rubbing vapor rub on him and singing a song his mother warbled to him . After Leonard found out on his cell phone , he and his buddies sneak back in with an upset Penny waiting . . . This was one of the most hilarious episodes I've seen this season ! From Sheldon's various sickness reactions to Penny's flabbergasted indignities to Leonard , Howard , and Raj's shenanigans , this was such a top-notch outing ! And I loved Howard's quoting of the "" dirty paws off my popcorn "" line from the first Apes outing since I watched this a few weeks after the originator of that one , Charlton Heston , recently died . One more thing , Chuck Lorre made his 200th vanity card here and tells us . . . how lonely he is . He can't be too much so since he now has two hit TV shows in a row !


Text2: While chaotic , The Captain's Christmas was a pretty enjoyable holiday cartoon starring The Captain and the Kids Having just discovered this Christmas cartoon starring The Captain and the Kids on YouTube , I have to say-the plotting is all over the place what with peg-leg John stealing The Captain's disguise as Santa Claus , breaking into Mama and her boys'-Hans and Franz-house not to mention their toys and then vowing to make amends because of a crisis of conscience and not getting arrested for his previous doings ? Well , it is Christmas and forgiveness is ample here . Having said all that , there are some pretty funny gags here and I loved seeing John and his co-horts sing with their tongues moving up and down in rhythm and with Friz Freleng as director-having temporarily left Leon Schlesinger for M-G-M-you know you're getting some good musical animation . So with all that , I'll just be generous and recommend The Captain's Christmas .

10,"Text1: Belatedly Hollywood does Rodgers and Hart's Masterpiece Lorenz Hart wrote in a different style from his successor as partner to Richard Rodgers ( Oscar Hammerstein 2nd ) . Hart had a more smart alecky type of lyric , less wholesome . But he still was quite a clever and intelligent lyricist . His tragedy was a personal one . Hammerstein had a happy home life . Hart was a troubled bi-sexual ( most of the time he was actually a homosexual , but he did love at least one of his Broadway stars , Vivian Siegal , and proposed to her late in his life ) . He also had a serious drinking problem . Rodgers too had an alcohol problem , but it was in relative control until the 1960s . Hart's growing binges in the 1930s and early 1940s began to fray the partnership . Rodgers would later admit he got tired being a nurse to his partner . Their partnership was remarkably fruitful from the early 1920s to it's completion in 1944 , both on Broadway and in Hollywood . But most of their musicals were in the old fashion method of the songs fitted into the book - not worked into the book . Towards the end of the 1930s , with their "" Shakespeare "" musical THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE and their ballet / dance musical ON YOUR TOES they started doing more modern style musicals where the songs were used to push the story along . But it was not until 1940 that they came up with their masterpiece : PAL JOEY . PAL JOEY was based on a novel by John O'Hara ( author of BUTTERFIELD 8 and APPOINTMENT IN SAMARRA ) . It is actually a modern epistolary novel , with Joey writing letters describing his adventures to a friend ( hence ending the letters with "" Your pal , Joey "" ) . Joey , to put it bluntly , is an opportunistic heel using people all over the place . He hopes to eventually create the classiest nightclub in Chicago ( Joey is a professional emcee ) . He meets two women ( Linda who is his age , and Vera who is older and richer ) . He keeps jumping and reassuring each until he is caught up in a set of cross-purposed lies . A blackmail attempt puts an end to the entire dream , and both women dump Joey . His last song is how his best friend is himself . The original musical flopped - Broadway was yet to be ready for a musical with an anti-hero . But it had a splendid score of clever tunes , many with double-entendre lyrics ( such as "" Happy Little Hunting Horn "" and "" Our Little Den of Iniquity "" ) . It had Siegal as Vera ( she introduced "" Bewitched , Bothered , and Bewildered "" ) , Elaine Stritch ( in a supporting part as a reporter who interviewed Gypsy Rose Lee - she sang "" Zip "" ) , and ( as the star ) Gene Kelly . It's nice to report that there is surviving color and black and white film from home cameras of Kelly in several scenes dancing . None with the music , however . It was not until a 1951 revival that the musical became a smash hit . If you read the facts on this thread you will see how long the studios tried to get PAL JOEY onto film . It was not until 1957 that it finally got made . Kelly had been originally wanted for repeating the role , but circumstances prevented this . Instead the role ended up with Frank Sinatra , Vera was played by the film's actual star , Rita Hayworth , and Linda by Kim Novak . The main structure of the story was kept , such as the triangle and Joey's dream of being owner / boss of the classiest nightclub ( here , though , in San Francisco ) . Joey's heel personality is still there , but softened towards the end ( in the musical he is a heel to the conclusion ) . The blackmail plot ( involving Gladys Bumps and her boy-friend Ludlow Lowell ) is dropped , although Gladys remains as a hostile , suspicious chorus girl ( she knows Joey's past ) played well by Barbara Nicholls . The cast was a Columbia one , with only one face that is a fair regular one among Sinatra cronies ( Hank Henry as Mike , the nightclub manager - he also popped up in OCEAN'S ELEVEN and THE JOKER IS WILD ) . It is a well done song fest of Rodgers and Hart

Text2: "" But Square-cut or Pear-shaped , These Rocks Don't Lose Their Shape ! "" As pointed out the film GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is really the first great movie role in the career of Marilyn Monroe . Given the brevity of her film career ( roughly a decade ) , one third of it passed without her being more than . . . well , let's face it "" male eye candy "" . Her sexiness and apparently "" dumb blond "" personality fit her just as a film decoration - an entertainment for drooling men to watch . This was hardly fair ( as Marilyn did eventually prove ; and as fellow movie bombshells like Jayne Mansfield rarely did ) . Marilyn had popped up in some films of interest : the last Marx Brother Movie ( as a Marx Brother Movie ) , LOVE HAPPY - but only for one wasted moment ; MONKEY BUSINESS ( as an imagined rival to Ginger Rogers - but again wasted , as she was playing opposite Cary Grant ) ; THE ASPHALT JUNGLE ( where she was Louis Calhern's mistress ) ; CLASH BY NIGHT ( where she essayed a serious part , but was again in support to Barbara Stanwyck ) . I suspect it was that her physical attributes dictated the sex appeal over anything else . But it wasted one third of her film career ! Marilyn was not seen to have a brain . Other blonds did show intelligence ( Doris Day and Kim Novak and Grace Kelly come to mind , and all three were getting meatier roles in this period ) . But Marilyn could only hope for some break to take her out of the background . Anita Loos had written her novella in the 1920s , and it was a smash hit then and ever since . One really ought to read the book to understand a small difference between Loos ' view of Lorelei Lee of Little Rock , Arkansas , and both the musical version of Carol Channing and the film version of Marilyn to see the improvement in the latter two . Loos was spoofing the dumb blond . Lorelei is dumb - she has no sense of the real world . She is telling her own story in the novella ( by the way , Carol Channing actually did a recording of the book that is worth listening to ) . Lorelei is the sort of idiot who insists she was an actress in film because she was in the Babylonian palace staircase shot ( with 10 , 000 other people ) in Griffiths ' INTOLERANCE . She is a good time girl - a modern flapper sans intelligence . Money and success fall into her lap ( quite literally ) due to her affect on men . She's aware of it , but she lacks the sense that the stage and screen versions add . Channing and Monroe both show they understand that CURRENTLY they are appealing to men , but that with aging they can't depend on this attraction to pay the bills . Monroe ( in the film ) may try to imagine what a tiara would look like on her in a childish way at a ship's dinner table , but she knows the security of owning such jewelry brings . The final moment that her cleverness is revealed is when she confronts Taylor Holmes ( the father of her fianc√© Tommy Noonan ) in Paris . She openly says she is interested in Holmes ' money , and that men are hypocrites because they want their daughters to marry only rich men , and don't want their sons to wind up with "" gold diggers "" . Holmes has to admit that she is smarter than he was told , and she says she can be smart when she wants to be . The appealing thing of the film is the camaraderie between Monroe and Jane Russell . People hearing of the teaming thought the set would become a real war-zone between blonde and brunette bombshells . Instead the two actresses became lifelong friends , and their friendship translates well between that of Lorelie and Dorothy Shaw . They both are aware of their effect on men , and their need for a supporting sister figure . And they work fine as a team . Note how they handle Elliot Reid when they want to get the incriminating photos he's taken of Marilyn and Charles Coburn ( "" Beakie "" ) . The men do well in their parts , especially Noonan as the fretful Gus and Reid as the smart ( usually ) detective Ernie ( he does eventually prove himself to the satisfaction","{""output"": ""YES""}"
11,"Text1: Disappointing Hammer thriller Hammer studios were obviously most famous for their horror flicks , but they did produce some work in other genres ; and the thriller genre was one of their strongest outside horror , especially during the sixties with films such as Paranoiac and A Taste of Fear . I had rather high hopes for this one going into it despite its poor reputation simply for the fact that Hammer produced it and they have produced some good thrillers ; such as those mentioned , but unfortunately it would seem that the studio's success in this genre didn't continue into the seventies as Crescendo , despite some good moments and positive elements , is a largely lacklustre thriller . The plot focuses on a young girl who goes to stay at a house in France to help her with a thesis . The house used to belong to a famous music composer but is now owned by his wife and son after the composer's death . The girl soon gets to meet the family as well as the staff and soon it becomes apparent that not everything is as it should be ; mostly because everyone in the house is a weirdo ! The film's main problem is that it largely fails to be interesting ; the story is derivative and not all that interesting anyway , and this isn't compensated for by the characters ( who are also largely uninteresting ) so we end up with a film that doesn't fit the ' thriller ' bill very well . Most of the film takes place in an old , large house ; although director Alan Gibson doesn't really make best use of this in terms of atmosphere . The director would go on to make the latter two films in the popular Dracula series - the fun Dracula A . D . 1972 and the disappointing Satanic Rites of Dracula and both of these lacked atmosphere too . Crescendo was apparently made for TV and this is pretty obvious as it's all quite tame ; there are actually a few murders in this film but we never get to see much blood and they're not very brutal . Nobody in the cast particularly stands out either ; Stefanie Powers is the biggest standout in the lead role , though not particularly for her performance . There is a twist at the end which comes as something of a surprise , but as the build up to it is quite dull ; the twist doesn't come off all that well . Overall , I can't say I enjoyed this film much and I'd only recommend it to Hammer Horror completists .


Text2: Overrated , but still excellent entertainment I remember , back in 1999 ( or it could have been the start of 2000 ) , when I first saw The Matrix . It was big , bold , loud , exciting . . . it had guns , bullet time , Rage Against the Machine , plenty of action , a hot woman in a lead role . . . . I remember thinking "" I should like this "" . But I didn't . Like Kill Bill , it's hard to believe that a fan of extreme blood and gore like myself could possibly dislike a film that sees one lady pluck out another lady's eye , drop it on the floor and stand on it , but it's true . OK , it's a little easier to believe when you consider that every scene in Kill Bill , apart from that one and the Lucy Lui fight was rubbish , but I'm sure you can see what I'm getting at . Fast forward 4 or 5 years to today , and the rewatch . I have a theory that states that any film that I enjoy cannot possibly be bad , because I watch movies for enjoyment ( nobody watches movies to be bored ) and if a movie fulfils that need for enjoyment , then it has done it's job and therefore it can't be bad . And I enjoyed The Matrix . However , I maintain that it's not a great film . Now , if Pulp fiction has taught us anything ; it's that it isn't what you take , it's what you do with it . . . . but by god , the Wachowski Brothers should definitely consider changing their name to the Wachowski BanditsFor a start ; the film is Star Wars reincarnated . Keanu Reeves is the one that brings balance to the force , and he even has everyone doubting him for a while ( ! ) , Princess Morpheus gets kidnapped and tortured and our hero's must go and save her . . . him , the bad guys have taken over the galaxy . . . I mean the world , and there's only a bunch of rebels to save it , they go and see Yoda . . . I mean the Oracle , who predicts the future and stuff , there's training sequences a la The Empire Strikes Back , Neo must become one with the force , whoops , i mean ' believe ' , Agent Smith is Neo's father . . . oh , OK I made that last one up , but you see what I'm getting at . And it's not only Star Wars that the Wachowski Bandits have ripped off , The Terminator and it's sequel aren't safe either . Of course , they couldn't have made Agent Smith actually be liquid metal , as they'd have a lawsuit on their hands , but he is just another version of liquid metal really . . . isn't he ? Shown by the way he can transform from anyone . And what about the whole ' computers take over the world ' thing , you didn't think I wouldn't spot that did you ? And The Wachowski Bandits obviously aren't fascists , because even shitty movies aren't safe . What about the whole SN thing ? The way that the hackers are made to look cool . . . . Hackers anyone ? But like I said , it isn't what you take ; it's what you do with it . Just like Tarantino did , Bonnie and Clyde . . . I mean Andy and Larry have stolen all these elements , and mixed them up into one coherent , and trend setting piece of cinema . Also like Tarantino , The Doberman Gang haven't just stolen , they've made some stuff themselves as well . Bullet time , for a start . Of course , it's not much of an expansion on the slow motion in films like The Killer ; but still . Also , the idea of the ' matrix ' itself is an original one . ( unless it's been ripped off a film I haven't seen / heard of ) The soundtrack fits too , which is rare when it's mostly rave / heavy rock music . I think there's only Natural Born Killers and Lost Highway that I can think of when it has worked . Anyway , when Rage's "" Wake Up "" came on before the credit sequence , it fit very well . Also , the scene during the training with the woman in red and the agent worked well with it's music","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Stallone does well , and the relationship between him and Schneider ( who , well , he does well , as well . . . well ) is quite funny ( in general , the humor is nicely done and tends to work ) . Assante makes up for whatever acting talent he may lack by bringing a lot of energy and passion to his performance , with great results .

Basically Christopher Emmanuel ' Manny ' Balestrero ( Henry Fonda ) is an ordinary New York musician who is wrongfully identified and arrested for the crime of hold-up robbery , as he was innocently getting money for his wife Rose ( Psycho's Vera Miles ) to have dental treatment . Manny constantly pleads his innocence , but in doing so looks even more guilty , especially host to the police and witnesses who point to him . Unfortunately , Rose breaks down into a depression and is institutionalised , while his trial isn't going well , even granted mistrial , but thankfully , awaiting re-trial , the real criminal is caught ( and there is a likeness by the way ) , and he is set free , while his wife still remains in her quiet state , don't worry , the ending text said she recovered , and they moved to Florida .

You already have a sense of it as Plainview plies the unsophisticated rubes with a pittance compared to the value of their underground wealth . Those scenes conjure up ideas of what it must have really been like during the heady days of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century robber barons . Greed and power , pure and simple , taken well beyond the measure of Humphrey Bogart's character in "" The Treasure of the Sierra Madre "" which director Anderson watched faithfully prior to his filming of this modern masterpiece .

17,"Text1: the ' best ' Sandler movie in about five years ( which still means its only ' good ' ) When I was younger ( i . e . back in the last decade ) , I was an unashamed Adam Sandler fan , as he was made for the kind of target audience ( young teens ) that I was in . Then , as time went on , his comedies got a little bit stale , with only one or two exceptions ( the best , of course , being his role in Punch Drunk Love thanks to PT Anderson ) . As of late , sentiment , or just poor scripts , have gotten in the way of anything that's done it well for me , though I still hold him at the least as being a guilty pleasure . Now comes You Don't Mess with the Zohan , and I'm happy to report that it's overall very funny , probably his funniest since Anger Management ( which was somewhat underrated at the time ) . It's got one of his oddest set-ups , and sometimes the plot kind of clicks along to a stupid tone ( i . e . a mall trying to set up in an Israeli / Palestinian neighborhood ) , but there's a real charm to Sandler's character , behind all of the outrageous gags and running goofs ( i . e . hummus , big-crotch thrusts , Mel Gibson ) . The set-up is simple enough : a bad-ass Moussad agent who can kill a person almost without trying , fakes his own death against a Palestinian kingpin ( John Tuturro ) , and goes for his dream to become a professional hair-dresser in America . He gets that dream , as well as having sex with many , many older women who somehow get turned on like in Herbal Essences shampoo ads X100 , but of course falls in love with the Palestinian girl who runs the shop he works at . There's some minor intrigue involving a cab-driver ( Rob Schneider , not as crappy as usual ) with a grudge against Zohan with a goat memory , and the eventual return of Tuturro's character ( who , I might add , is absolutely uproariously funny in this , easily his funniest part since his days with the Coens ) for a near final showdown . What makes most of the movie work though - co-scripted by Sandler and Robert Smigel for the first time in years , aided probably tremendously by Judd Apatow - is its dedication to the raunchy nature of the material , avoiding sentimentality in lieu for tasteless sex jokes ( i . e . a certain hair-down-there is mentioned ) , and even some funny barbs at Israeli / Palestinian culture . It might not be the deepest satire , as many jokes revolve weirdly around Hackeysack , but it made me laugh , which is all I can really attest to . There are also , I should add , some pretty neat cameos and bit parts thrown in , like Shelly Berman from Curb Your Enthusiasm , Mariah Carey , the "" Let's Get Ready to Rumble "" guy in an actual small role , and amazingly Dave Matthews as a redneck-terrorist for hire .

The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked , additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness , however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way . Its as if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away . Additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life , I'm guessing that Boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had . It really stinks . Clearly Boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he's ever learned about film gets flushed . The last film he made that was this bad was Seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films I've ever seen . This isn't that bad , but it is close simply because it should have been better . Then again Udo Keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film . I'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're catching it on cable .

Bullock plays Sidda , a successful writer and the daughter of the outrageous Vivi . Both mother and daughter are in crisis after Sidda's profile appears in Time Magazine , and the profile's author has emphasized Sidda's problems with her mother . Mother and daughter start sending hate notes , photos with their faces cut out , invitations with no address or date , etc . to one another as well as hanging up the phone upon hearing the other's voice . The other three ya-yas visit Sidda , slip her a date-rape drug and bring her to Louisiana , where they all live , so they can show her their Ya-ya secrets book and she can learn some things about her mother that she never knew . The somewhat contrived plot is saved by the wonderful acting of the entire cast . Burstyn has long been one of my favorite actresses , and she creates a powerful portrait of the alcoholic temperamental diva Vivi . She's backed up beautifully by another of my favorite actresses , Maggie Smith as well as Flanagan and Knight . Ashley Judd plays the young Vivi . She does an excellent job showing Vivi's progression from a fun-loving young woman rejected by her mother ( Cherry Jones ) but adored by her father to an unhappy , drunken and overwhelmed one with a husband she doesn't love and too many children . Bullock's angry Sidda is effective , and her scenes with Burstyn are very poignant . James Garner as Bullock's long - suffering but loving father gives a wonderful performance , showing a caring but resigned man who has somehow managed to live with this woman for years . This isn't Fried Green Tomatoes . It's a portrait of an abusive childhood , mental illness , misinformation about medications - and survival . Unfortunately some of the people reviewing this film don't have a clear understanding of mental illness and what the wrong medication can do to someone . The story is tempered with humor and vibrant characterizations and the old adage , we don't pick our parents ; if we can make our peace with their lives and with them , it makes life a little easier .

19,"Text1: Planet of the Oops ! I'm not entirely familiar with all of the other Planet of the Apes films , but I don't think there could be anything in any of them that would change my mind about the 2001 version . We start off with an electrical storm in space that results in some serious time travel , just like we saw in Lost In Space , which results in our hero winding up thousands of years in the future and on an unknown planet . Seconds after surviving the crash landing of his pod on this mysterious planet , Leo Davidson ( Mark Walhberg ) finds himself surrounded by fleeing HUMANS . The first thing I thought was that there are humans and apes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy roughly 5000 years in the future , but later we learn ( also as seen in Lost In Space ) that Leo's ship also passed through that time warp and landed in the same place , leaving the humans to go into submission to the out-of-control apes that were on the ship for experimentation , and the apes themselves were left to evolve and take control , ultimately turning into the hard-nosed apes that ruled the planet when Leo crash landed . That was a mouthful . Pretty creative though , once we are eventually informed as to what the hell is going on . So Leo is stuck on this planet where the roles are basically reversed and exaggerated between humans and apes , and now it is entirely up to Leo to save this planet's version of the human race from the oppression of the apes . Tim Roth delivers a horribly annoying performance as General Thade , the militant leader of the apes who is so filled with hatred for the humans ( for reasons never made entirely clear ) that he operates just like a machine . He's always grunting and growling and always has his head tilted downward like he's expecting physical confrontation at all times , and his constant guttural tone of voice makes him almost amusing after a while . One of the biggest problems with this movie is that the apes are so well made up , but they also have tremendous intelligence , as is made evident by their strikingly human eyes , and yet they switch back and forth from normal speech to the same screeching and screaming that you hear from the monkeys at the zoo . There is a scene where General Thade is told that the humans crossed the river using the apes ' own horses , and he jumps all around the place , screeching and jumping and breaking things , and then he's back on the ground talking like a warrior . It's so hard to take this stuff seriously . Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Ari , the weirdly attractive ape who is disgruntled with the way that the humans are treated by the apes , and who turns against her own kind to help the humans escape . There is a childish scene at the end of the film where Leo kisses Ari that is sure to get a laugh from any audience , while the stunningly but almost weirdly beautiful Estella Warren provides the human love interest . It's a good thing that they had a human woman in this movie to take romantic interest in Leo , because without her we only have Ari , who is 100 % ape but who acts exactly like a human woman while interacting with Leo . For the first half of the film , I was a little nervous about the possibility of a little bestiality happening somewhere in there . So we know that Ari is helping the humans because she is disillusioned with her violent species , but they are also accompanied by another ape - Attar , I think ( hey , half the fun was trying to figure out who was underneath all that make-up , right ? ) - and we never know why he agrees to go along , knowing that he will face severe punishment upon returning , which is one of the movies more simplistic but peeving oversights . It is , however , the ending of the film that ruins it beyond all hope for being saved . At the beginning of the film , when Leo took off in the pod toward the electrical storm , he was going after the pod of his chimp , with whom all communication had been lost . He gets swept away in the same electrical storm as the chimp got caught in , and winds up on the planet described above .

Text2: 007 entering the computerized age ? Dr . No , the original 007 film , was basically a murder mystery , so whenever I see a Bond film like A View to A Kill , I am always struck by how far the series has come and how much bigger the stories get . In this installment , we get a truly evil , classic Bond-style villain with Max Zorin ( played by a wonderfully nefarious Christopher Walken - who looks exactly like Luscious Malfoy , by the way ) , with a truly evil , classic master plan . The movie starts with Bond on a mission in the Soviet Union where he narrowly escapes after recovering a microchip off the snow-bound body of another British agent . There is a great ski chase in the movie's opening scene as he's pursued by the Russians , but at one point , the song "" California Girls "" comes on for about a minute and then fades out just as suddenly . I'm going to go ahead and say that this must be the most out of place piece of music in any James Bond film ever made . It seems that the microchip that he recovered is a "" silicon integrated unit "" capable of triggering a magnetic pulse and blowing out everything that uses a similar chip , which would include anything from toasters to the most advanced computers . I didn't know toasters were computerized in the mid-1980s ( are they now ? ) , but needless to say , a nuclear explosion over England would short out the entire country , destroying their national defenses and rendering the entirety of their population completely toast-less . The British have a computer chip that is impervious to all magnetic pulse damage , and Bond's mission is to find out how the Soviets have managed to get a hold of an exact copy of one . An investigation of a suspicious horse-race gambling circuit leads to Max Zorin ( also the maker of the original chip ) , who is suspected of selling the design to the Russians . But of course , starting a war between the British and the Russians is not nearly enough , Zorin plans to create an underground earthquake in California , sink the entire Silicon Valley and corner the market on all computer manufacturing ! I think it's safe to say that the plot of this particular movie is years ahead of its time . If Zorin had succeeded in his plan , no one would have known that he had created the earthquake , and he would now be the most powerful man in the universe . His sidekick , May Day , is played by Jamaican actress Grace Jones , who is best known for doing scary roles like this one . I'm not sure what the deal was with her hair in this movie , but they definitely went overboard a few times . There is one point in the film where it looks like it was sculpted to look exactly like Batman's ears . Who comes up with this stuff ? Nevertheless , she is one of the better female Bond villains ( and a rare example of genuine character development and change ) , as is Walken's Max Zorin . In order to raise money for his take-over of the computer market , he has devised a scheme where he implants devices into race-horses that time injections of horse steroids , so that they aren't detected in pre-race blood tests . Pretty clever , but it's the design of that underground earthquake that really takes the cake . It's so good that it even provided the inspiration of an episode of "" Ducktales ! "" There is some depth added to the characters of Zorin and May Day near the end of the film as well when it is revealed that Zorin is ex-KGB and , if it weren't for them , he and May Day would now be nothing but walking biological experiments . We never learn exactly what is meant by this , but it doesn't matter . There is a great chase through the streets of Sa Francisco and a thrilling finale atop the Golden Gate Bridge . Love it or hate it , this is definitely vintage Bond . Note : A disclaimer at the beginning of the movie informs us that "" Neither the name Zorin nor any other name or character in this film is meant to portray a real company or actual person . "" What about the KGB ?

20,"Text1: A rather fun Zelda like game for the Sega Gensis . This game was actually a lot of fun and it is the only video game I have ever bought that came with a fruit rollup in it . I am also guessing that it was for the most part overlooked as I do not recall there ever being a sequel to this game despite the somewhat open ending to it . It was not perfect though as a couple of levels in this one could have one pulling out their hair , however , it is no more difficult than say a Legend of Zelda game in that regard . The plot is a bit different as you are a treasure seeker who stumbles across a fairy who seems to know the location of a rather large treasure . Also tracking the treasure a sort of rival group of treasure hunters who provide more comic relief than any sort of competition to the main character of the story . The quest takes place on an island and it has its various towns with various adventures and occupants who need varying degrees of help from the hero . The story is a bit different as there is trouble brewing in some areas , however , not in the way presented in most role playing games . You also have dungeons where you must get objects to get through them like those found in a Zelda game . The fighting is rather easy and the game never gets to challenging as far as the combat is concerned . Where it gets difficult is some of the dungeons puzzles can become a bit hard to figure out , and you have to back track to find some items you may need to get through other areas . Still , a very fun action role playing game for the Sega Genesis , I would not mind seeing a sequel or remake of it on one of the more advance systems as I think it would translate pretty good to one . However , that is highly unlikely to ever happen .


Text2: The fighting and the ending bring this one down a bit . The story has a young man taking the mantle of "" Devil Summoner "" . He wields a sword and gun , but in a pinch what sets him apart is his ability to summon demons to fight along side him or help him solve mysteries . He works at a detective agency and one day a girl with a bizarre request calls them to a bridge where the ultimate challenge awaits our hero . The story is rather good , and for the most part the game was okay as you could use demons to read people's minds and do various other things . The combat though was a bit of a pain . Not like the other games of the Shin Megemi Tensei name this one relies real time combat . A combat that at times is hard to pinpoint where exactly the enemy is in relationship to you so you end up swinging at air . You also run into very hard battles near the end and you almost always need a healing demon summoned to help you and you only get one demon on screen at a time . The ending to it was not anything special either . I prefer the fights in the other Shin Megemi games as they took more strategy , to many of the fights here turn into slashing away frantically . Still the setting is great in 1900's Japan , it is sort of like the Shadow Heart games in the way it is set in the real world . The music is okay for the most part , but it does get repetitive . Also , I would have like the characters to actually speak lines rather than just word boxes . Still , thanks to the story it is a all right game .

21,"Text1: A Classy New Coming Out Film with Emphasis on the East LA Community Fresh young talent and a healthy dollop of enthusiasm serve as the springboard of this well written ( Carlos Portugal and Charo Toledo ) , well directed ( Carlos Portugal ) and well acted exuberant story of those once perceived tightly closet doors of the East Los Angeles Hispanic community . Not that this is the first film to engage the topic of being gay in East LA - QUINCEA√ëERA is another superb film on the subject - but it addresses so many other aspects of family and social life happening now that it deserves a wide audience . With a cast of newcomers coupled with some very fine veterans of the screen EAST SIDE STORY comes to life in a highly entertaining fashion . Closeted schooled chef Diego Campos ( a fine debut by Ren√© Alvarado ) works as a waiter in his grandmother Sara's ( elegant Irene DeBari ) little Mexican restaurant where grumpy homophobic chef Don Rogelio ( Luis Accinelli ) presides in the kitchen . Diego dreams of opening his own restaurant but family ties keep him grounded . Diego's campy Aunt Bianca ( Gladise Jimenez ) returns from Monaco on one of her many expensive sojourns to find a man and changes begin to happen . Diego's equally closeted boyfriend Pablo Morales ( David Ber√≥n ) has been refusing to settle down in a relationship with Diego , claiming that the union is a ' passing fancy ' . When Bianca enters , Pablo's attentions turn to the sexy lady and Diego is brokenhearted . Into this m√©lange enters a white gay couple who buy a ' flip ' house across the street , a signal to the neighborhood that gentrification is just around the corner . The couple - Wesley ( Steve Callahan ) and Jonathan ( Cory Schneider ) - meet the morose Diego and a match strikes between Diego and Wesley . Jonathan is assigned all the lines having to do with prejudice and is the one who wants out of the neighborhood as soon as their house is enhanced and their gay friends begin to visit . The white couple move apart and Wesley and Diego begin a courtship dance that is encouraged by Diego's family . How Diego handles his loss of Pablo to his Aunt Bianca and copes with the possibility of being open with Wesley forms the story line . It is all the hilarious and not so hilarious sidebars that share the space of the ' outing ' that make the film so personal and successful . Carlos Portugal is clearly a talent to watch , as are his attractive and talented cast members . EAST SIDE STORY is a fine companion piece to QUINCEA√ëERA and should enjoy the same degree of popularity for all the same reasons ! Grady Harp


Text2: All the ingredients of a superb film . . . just not mixed yet ! BEAU TRAVAIL is a curious film . It is based on the story ' Billy Budd ' by Herman Melville and on the operatic adaptation by EM Forster of Benjamin Britten's magnificent BILLY BUDD and has all the right pieces in place to make a fine , updated adaptation of the story . Unfortunately the script fails to find the message of the story and so there is much correct atmosphere but little character development . The original story revolves around a warship ( The Rights o ' Man ) in the French and English war that takes on recruits while at sea . The Captain relates the story of how he was forced to hang the magnificently beautiful and loved new recruit Billy Budd because of an accidental death in part due to Budd's fatal flaw - his stammer . The Master at Arms notices Billy from the beginning as a creature of physical beauty and there is a strong physical attraction to the lad . Unable to cope with his feelings , the Master at Arms plots for the downfall of the object of his desire and lust and it is his manipulation that results in Billy's hanging , nearly causing a mutiny by Billy's shipmates . Billy is a Parsifal character - a ' guileless fool ' , who even in his sentencing to death still blesses the Captain of the ship . All well and good . The film here transplants much of this tale to a Foreign Legion outpost in Africa , and much of the above is insinuated . The appropriation is so complete that portions of Britten's opera BILLY BUDD are used to set scenes . But there the magic stops . The ' master at arms ' does not seem to desire the beautiful recruit but for some unexplained reason seeks to have him gone . Such a shame . It is as though the writer wanted to avoid homosexual overtones of the original and as a result the characters have no where to go . All of the actors are good , the scenery is bleak ( a desert here instead of the bleak sea of the original ) and appropriate , the music is an eclectic mix that works . All the ingredients are here to make a fine film , but it just doesn't come off . The director needed to see the old film version of Billy Budd starring Terrence Stamp to see that pitting the evil , sadistic , lusty master at arms against the virile , sensitive and good young man can and does work well .

Text2: No , Paris is Not Burning . I'd like to recommend this movie because it deals with a subject of such historic significance , but I found it confusing . It meanders all over the place , like the Seine . The Germans have been ordered to destroy the city , including its historical monuments , by an insane Adolf Hitler , if it is ever in danger of falling into Allied hands . That's clear enough , but then the waters turn turbid . The General in charge , Gert Frobe , is reluctant to follow the order for humanitarian reasons but will evidently do what he's told . He's held up by the French resistance , who gather their small arms and fire on German patrols . ( They were a lot more organized than I'd realized . ) A messenger is sent to the Americans to ask them to divert from their plans to destroy the German army and aid in the liberation of Paris . The request reaches General Bradley who agrees . The Free French Army enters Paris , followed by the Amis , and shortly the Germans are subdued and the city saved . For me , the most stirring moment is when two men activate the bells of Notre Dame . What a job . The huge old chimes weight tons and are covered with cobwebs and it takes a heap of huffing and puffing to get the clappers going but this is the liberation of Paris . It's one of those "" spot-the-stars "" movies , with more famous faces than you can count , and every other time one of them first appears on screen , the director , Rene Clement , moves the camera in for a close up in case you might miss the dimple in the middle of Kirk Douglas's chin . Well , maybe it's understandable since you've only got about 30 seconds to spot it . A central character would probably have helped to integrate these loosely linked tesserae . The sound is so terrible it distracts a viewer from the already fragmented story . The voices are all dubbed , of course , and only occasionally by their real-life owners , like Orson Welles and Tony Perkins ( in a stereotypical and dispensable role ) . The gun shots sound as if they were lifted from an inexpensive Italian war movie . Loud incidental noises have been added to the sound track - - the crunching of boots on gravel , the clicks of a bolt action rifle . Maurice Jarre's score isn't bad , however closely it resembles some of his other works during this period . The visuals are okay . Some black-and-white news footage from the street fighting is integrated into the drama . But it's not a gripping film and not very innovative . If a man is shot , he twirls around and dies in conventional Hollywood fashion . Nice shots of some Parisian tourist spots though . We get a good look at Napolean's tomb . I'm glad that Paris wasn't destroyed . The greatest sandwich I ever had was at a nondescript caf√© in the Gare du Nord . And it's good to see the Free French Army in combat in a movie like this . They may have been organized in exile but they did a splendid job alongside the rest of the Allies in Italy , particularly at Monte Cassino .

Neither cartoony nor really over the top ( okay just a bit ) this is a movie where everyone ( mostly ) behaves like real people .

Anne's father was one of two scientific physicians attempting to study and discover the cause and cure for this bizarre plague . Dr .

Text2: Enjoyable for what it is . Another in the line of European horror flicks to draw inspiration from - or rip off , if you will - George Romeros ' zombie classics "" Night of the Living Dead "" and "" Dawn of the Dead "" , this flick from exploitation veteran Bruno Mattei sees a plant in New Guinea - called a "" hope centre "" in the film - break down , spreading vapor into the jungle and creating zombies out of many of the locals . An intrepid reporter and her cameraman are joined by a S . W . A . T . team that need to make it to the hope centre in an attempt to solve the problem . Many folks are of the opinion that this is either so-bad-it's-good or just plain bad . It's hard to argue those points when so much of the dialog is insanely ludicrous and the performances so uninspired . ( Frank Garfield , however , contributes an eye-bulging , scenery-stomping performance as a flamboyant member of the S . W . A . T . team that certainly helps to break the tedium . ) It's a plodding film that offers nothing we haven't seen before ; although the frequent use of stock footage didn't annoy me as much as it did some viewers , it doesn't really add anything . The relentless onslaught of cheap gore has its moments ; the loving close-up , right at the end , of one characters ' demise , I thought was pretty amusing . One sequence involving the zombification of an adorable child , unfortunately , just isn't as disturbing as it ought to be . One of the most bizarre and goofy things that Mattei does is have one of his protagonists play dress-up and launch into a Gene Kelly routine right before the zombies have at him . I have no idea what to make of this . I acknowledge that there are certainly better films of this kind out there , but it worked for me as an engagingly stupid guilty pleasure , unoriginal and not particularly well made , but gleefully gory nonsense just the same .

Pas du tout Louis Malle thought nothing of mining his childhood / youth for films such as Au Revoir , Les Enfants and in most cases these quasi-autobiographical entries are among his finest work . This is no exception ; set in Dijon , perhaps best known as the centre of the moutard ( mustard ) industry , it features a family very like his own , a protagonist very like himself , constantly ragged by two older brothers , obsessed with Jazz and literature and crucially sharing a hotel room with his mother . Stated as baldly as this it's not going to have a line at the box office but as always it is what Malled does with these basic facts that makes this an outstanding film ; beginning with the period ' feel ' which is spot-on and on to which he grafts some brilliant ensemble acting so that although Benoit Ferreux and Lea Massari carry the burden the weight is distributed equally between the very fine supporting actors .

Text2: Gasser I usually find that British films of this vintage don't stand up too well - indeed in some cases they fell down even on release - but this is an exception . It's not too difficult too imagine how fresh it must have seemed back in the early fifties to palates jaded by war and austerity and the social history alone is worth the price of admission , for example John Gregson's barrister who has just over one hundred pounds in the bank yet lives in a delightful mews flat . William Rose's screenplay manages to wring sufficient changes on the rapidly changing fortunes in the race to the line to keep us interested and there's a nice contrast between the English Rose of Dinah Sheridan and the sophistication of Kay Kendall .

After an ( unfortunately staged ) accident fells a Roman soldier , Herman Rottger ( as Ben Hur ) is taken into custody . William S . Hart ( as Messala ) orders Mr . Rottger become a slave . Soon , Rottger wins freedom , and seeks revenge against Mr . Hart , in a "" Chariot Race "" . For the famed Chariot Race , the two stars simply ride by a stationary camera , while costumed people cheer . The good folks at Kalem ( the film company responsible ) were counting on viewers to have either seen "" Ben-Hur "" on stage , or read the Lew Wallace book . And , undoubtedly , most 1900s flicker watchers had the prior knowledge necessary to understand the action . This film highlights the inferiority of the medium , at that time . Director Olcott and Gene Gauntier , who was credited with having written the "" Ben Hur "" scenario , would have much greater artistic success with films like "" From the Manger to the Cross "" ( 1912 ) .

For the second half , it is 24 years later and she is running a chain of high class whore-house with the emphasis on torture .

Text2: Follows the formula , but at least does it with style and creativity . Contains spoiler The first thing I heard about The Italian Job was that it had a car chase in it that was supposed to be better than the one in The Matrix Reloaded . I'm not sure I would go that far , but there is no denying that there is some great action in this movie . It is , admittedly , an hour and forty minute Mini Cooper commercial , and it definitely follows the typical formula of a heist movie , but there are subtle differences that make it more than worth watching . Seth Green plays the part of Lyle , who I'll just describe as exactly the same character that he played in Enemy of the State to save time , but he provides some of the most entertaining scenes in the film . The creation of the ' Los Angeles ' largest traffic jam ever ' ( although I'm SURE I've been stuck in worse than that in that place ) is the movies main attraction , and Lyle creates it with suck geeky style that he makes it cool to be a computer nerd again . ( spoilers ) Charlize Theron plays Stella Bridger , the daughter of John Bridger ( Donald Sutherland ) , whose vicious murder provides much of the drive for the conflict of the entire film . Stella plays the beautiful blonde with a whole world of possibilities open to her because she's so intelligent and strong , and then she is sent into an emotional turmoil for most of the film . So basically exactly the same character she played in The Devil's Advocate , Reindeer Games , The Astronaut's Wife , Mighty Joe Young , The Legend of Bagger Vance , Men of Honor , 15 Minutes , etc . Donald Sutherland is , of course , his usual badass self , with a calm and collected cool that is rivaled only by such greats as Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood . He is an actor who naturally portrays characters who have plans that go just a little beyond what is spoken aloud ( except , of course , for the character he played in Backdraft ) . In a movie that's populated almost entirely by stereotyped characters , it's nice that at least one of the caricatures is not routine and boring . Mark Wahlberg is another caricature , but he is also not boring just because it's so much fun to watch him be ped off and seeking revenge . I've always thought that he had a tiny bit of a hard time playing anything other than a former-musician-turned-actor , but he definitely has his own style which fits perfectly with his role in The Italian Job . And then there is Edward Norton , one of today's few young actors who promises to ultimately obtain as much skill in portraying diverse characters as people like Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman , who are so good at what they do that they can literally play any role in the world should the need arise . One of the only things that I was a little apprehensive about when I went to see The Italian Job was that I knew Norton was going to play the bad guy , and I have always been so staggered by his performances in movies like Primal Fear and American History X that I was a little bummed that I would have to watch him caught and probably killed in this movie ( thankfully I was spared the latter , which is more than can be said of movies in similar situations , like Training Day ) . Despite my opinion that Edward Norton's role as the bad guy was initially a little disappointing to me , it also turned out to be one of the best parts of the movie , and not only because Norton is such a spectacularly talented actor , some credit also goes to the writers in this category . As a whole , The Italian Job doesn't stray too far from the typical heist movie formula , but the thing that really makes it interesting as we're led to the ending that we always knew we would see is that the villain , Norton , is not a complete moron , as villains quite often are . When the rest of the team finds him , a year after he betrayed them to steal the $35 million worth of gold that they stole together ( in an opening sequence that rivals any one in any James Bond movie ever made ) , we get some pleasant surprises in a movie","{""output"": ""NO""}"
28,"Text1: More gory than the first , but not as good The director obviously thought that when making a sequel , everything has to be bigger and heavier . But bigger doesn't equal better , and it definitely isn't the case here . The death scenes are unnecessary gory , and only that ; practically no build-up to the scenes , and little to no excitement . Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody , gory death scenes , you won't like this movie . In fact , you will most likely hate it , unless you're a big fan of the genre , or of the first Final Destination . It's a huge gore fest , and probably made for ( and maybe even by ) fans of the old "" body-count "" movies , from the 1980's . It has very little realism ; whereas the first Final Destination had some realism in the death scenes , this had little to none at all . As many other slasher movies , it has the little "" twist-in-the-end "" at the very end , but it is very weak , considering what it could have been . The first movie is a lot better , but if you need to watch a gory movie where you pretty much sit around and wait for people to die , this isn't the worst you can watch . But if the choice is between this and the first , I would definitely choose the first .


Text2: Not a hero I can really back . Let me start out by saying this is one of the more enjoyable movies I have ever seen on Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Despite this fact the movie still has many , many flaws and things I don't like about it . For one is the hero . He is not really a hero , but since the camera focuses on him most of the time I will call him the hero . He is an apparent master thief who lives in an underground hideout comparable to Lex Luther's place in Superman . How one man and his girlfriend could build a place like this I will never know , because you can't really contract for this type of job . I don't mind the fact Diabolik steals so much either , it is the fact he kills guards and whoever else is in his way . The officer after him makes a deal with criminals to get this guy he is so bad . Though I am afraid that none of Diabolik's opponents are the sharpest knives in the drawer . How you can't catch one man is beyond me . And how does Diabolik know every counter plan the police plan , he works by himself and sends his girlfriend in to scout places , but he can't really get the information that he apparently has . Oh well , it isn't the best movie in the world , but there are good points to it . The girlfriend is really attractive , some of the lines are funny , and seeing Diabolik find a way out of trouble is entertaining .

As things turn out , the originally hinted at science fiction angle is dispensed with . Before the film's "" flashback "" , Griffith reveals she is "" an old woman of sixty , whose youth has been restored to her by a modern miracle of science . "" This follows the explanation offered in writer Gertrude Atherton's autobiographical "" Black Oxen "" ( 1923 ) . Ms . Atherton wrote about her own "" youthful "" restoration . The process , or "" Steinach treatment "" , rejuvenated a woman's youth and vitality by X-raying her ovaries . Interestingly , in real life , actress Griffith employed a different ( and , likely , more effective ) "" youth restoration "" technique - - she claimed to be her own much younger sister . On film , she looks lovely , but there isn't much depth in Griffith's characterization ; she and Tearle essay a common romance . During the flashback , Griffith looks more tired than old ; and , before the process , she doesn't look at all old enough to be a "" woman of sixty "" . Griffith's reason for contemplating youth is not as interesting or realistic as supporting character Claire McDowell ( as Agnes Trevor ) . Ms .

Text2: SPHINX ( Franklin J .

For the record , director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL ( 1978 ) ‚Äì a similarly fanciful but much more engrossing suspenser and , unfortunately , SPHINX was a false step from which his so-far impressive career would not recover . Despite its scope and reasonably decent cast , however , this one proved a critical and commercial flop ‚Äì mainly because the narrative just isn‚Äôt very thrilling : in fact , it‚Äôs quite dreary ( feeble attempts at horror ‚Äì the archaeologist heroine having to put up with entombment , rotting corpses galore , and even an attack by a flurry of bats ‚Äì notwithstanding ) . Lesley Anne-Down is the lovely leading lady , stumbling upon a lost treasure ‚Äì it‚Äôs actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners , who have appropriated much of the country‚Äôs heritage ( under the pretext of culture ) for far too long . Sir John Gielgud turns up in a thankless bit early on as the antique dealer who puts Down on the way of the loot , and pays for this ‚Äòact of treason‚Äô with his life .

The wife is gobbled up by the local savages and the daughter abducted . Taylor loses an arm but manages to escape ; years later , he organizes a new expedition to find and bring back his daughter .

This just doesn't have the same palpable sense of atmosphere , or danger , as "" Cannibal Holocaust "" or "" Cannibal Ferox "" . It's low in the sleaze factor , too , and the scenes of flesh munching go on too long without being particularly shocking . The natives themselves are hardly convincing ; anyone watching can look ( not too closely ) and see that some of them are played by white performers . As a matter of fact , this film marks too much time in general with not much happening . It didn't even have any standout moments that could otherwise recommend it . Cliver is good enough in the lead , with Franco regular Lina Romay in a supporting role and Franco himself in a cameo . Sabrina Siani is a knockout but is clearly not much of an actress .

Text2: The sound of one hand strangling . . . Very interesting and pretty effective psychological horror stars the always wonderful Michael Caine as the creator of a fantasy-based comic strip who is having some pretty strained relations with wife Anne ( Andrea Marcovicci ) . Well , his life takes a horrific turn when , in a bizarre traffic accident , his drawing hand is severed . As Jon Lansdale ( Caine ) goes to live in solitude with a new gig as a college professor in California , the missing hand seems to have taken on a "" life "" of its own , murdering everybody who makes Jon angry . I severely under-rated this one upon first viewing a few years back . I now realize what the intent here was , and the film works quite well , drawing us into the increasingly unstable and paranoid mind of Jon . Caine does a highly creditable job in this role . It's a dark and moody tale , well realized by future Oscar-winning film-maker Oliver Stone , in this early directorial effort . Stone also gets good performances out of the supporting cast , which also includes adorable young Mara Hobel - the young Christina Crawford in the same years ' "" Mommie Dearest "" , Rosemary Murphy , Annie McEnroe , Bruce McGill , Charles Fleischer , Pat Corley , and Tracey Walter . Carlo Rambaldi supplies the many different hand effects , James Horner contributes a solid score from the early years of his career , and King Baggot is the excellent cinematographer . Stone has a very good crew to work with here . In contrast to the psychological aspects of the story , Stone doesn't shy away from the red stuff when it's time . The severing of the hand is a good and gruesome set piece . For the most part , though , it's a subtle piece of work . Although the final scene doesn't seem all that necessary , the picture does end on a memorable final note . The final freeze frame of Caines ' face just says it all . Overall , it's an under-rated shocker worth looking into for the curious .

Text2: A Nutshell Review : Oliver Twist "" Please sir , may I have some more ? "" Ah , the immortal line from Charles Dickens ' classic , from the book Oliver Twist , telling the story of an orphaned boy , with sheer incredible luck and a melancholic , likable face . The book has been remade into movies countless of times , and this one is Roman Polanski's take . I haven't read the novel ( yes , I heard gasps of horror ) so I can't offer a scene for scene comparison . So perhaps you could shed some light on the short summary I'm about to give . The first 10 minutes will highlight the immortal line where Oliver is sent to a factory made up of orphaned boys . There , he gets sold to a coffin maker , where he makes his escape . Throughout his journeys , he meets up with many benefactors who assist him in one way or another . Some good , like Mr Brownlow , and some bad , like Fagin , who's the caretaker of a group of child pickpockets . And it is in London where Oliver was picked up by the Artful Dodger , and introduced to the rest of the crew led by Fagin . He learns the trade , but in a botched first attempt , gets sort of rescued by Mr Brownlow , and has his first taste of a decent life . However , the lowlifes are afraid of him squealing their whereabouts to the police , and hence , recapture Oliver and uses him to steal from Mr Brownlow . And of course I won't bore you with the details but suffice to say that the main villain of the show , Bill Sykes , an associate of Fagin , gets more screen time than Oliver himself towards the end . It's a lavish production , with big sets . The streets of Old London were beautifully created , and so was the soundtrack chugging so indiscreetly in the background . Ben Kingsley , as Fagin , disappears into his role behind the makeup - you'll hardly recognize him , and Barney Clark as Oliver seemed likable enough too , and provided enough emotions to punctuate the final scene . So for those , like me , who have not read the book , this should prove to be an invaluable 130 minute introduction to the real thing . Sure you can have more , by picking up the book .

35,"Text1: mediocre B thriller The year before "" les Kidnappeurs "" ( 1998 ) opened in France , Graham Guit had signed a tight and dry B whodunit with a dash of humor : "" le Ciel est √† Nous "" ( 1997 ) . Its model in the form and the content was the violent and bloody universe of Quentin Tarantino . One year later , hiring the same crew , he did it again with "" les Kidnappeurs "" , obviously an endeavor to produce a new little worked up whodunit in the same vein as its predecessor . Alas , it's a let-down which isn't up to scratch with "" le Ciel est √† Nous "" and has virtually nothing commendable . There have been harsh words about Guit's effort and rightly so . It fails to be exciting albeit the onset starts under auspicious skies . As a matter of fact , the whole interest of the film remains confined in the outset with this astute idea : how Ulysse reveals to his accomplices how it is possible to simply succeed the burglary without danger and to pocket the loot . But as the average viewer can guess , it's too good to be true since in reality , the operation will go awry and the loot will be rubbish . It's the only watchable part of the flick and the job must be done under Freddy's orders . Alas , after the first meeting of the gang with him , it's downhill and it seems that Guit has left the building . The rest of the film consists of complex filler and its desultory character is revealed in all its splendor . Various inexplicable twists , complications and muddle clutter a screenplay written besides in a snap manner without altering and more serious without any attempt to clarify it . The director doesn't bother for his job and shelved a crucial premise of the cinema : a film is a sort of communicative link between its author and the viewer . But here , by delivering a story which is hard to decipher , Guit shows no respect for the audience . As he botches his job with his couldn't-care-less directing , it doesn't help his actors who do what they can to save the film from wreckage although it is doomed to failure . Too bad for young interprets like Elodie Bouchez or Melvil Poupaud who made the mistake to get themselves embroiled in this dud . Isaac Sharry makes his part count early in the story but then it becomes uninteresting . Romain Duris stands out as the lousy baddie with an IQ close to zero but one prefers him when he teams up with Cedric Klapisch . It even seems that the cast , by moments prefers to enjoy sunny landscapes . Loose : it's the most suitable adjective to qualify Guit's piece of work who neglected to include stringent in his mind when he wrote the film . A hash of money as well as a waste of film both for the actors and the audience . Take "" le Ciel est √† Nous "" instead . NB : Elie Kakou dies at the end of the film , a sinister omen when one knows that he died of a cancer the following year in 1999 . . .

Text2: The best story King Arthur movies are a dime a dozen . Not only do we have this , but also Merlin , Excalibur , Lancelot and Guinevere , Knights of the Round Table , Prince Valiant , Merlin of the Crystal Cave , Quest for Camelot , the awful First Knight and the apparently even worse ( and imaginatively titled ) King Arthur . Mists of Avalon is the best I've seen so far . After the rather childish Merlin and the just plain weird Excalibur I was pleased that this film was more grown-up and with better characters who you can actually connect with . I've not seen Julianna Margulies in anything else aside from Out for Justice ( yay ! ) and Ghost Ship . But damn , she was totally gorgeous as Morgaine , a character previously portrayed as a villain . Though I have the book by Marion Zimmer Bradley , I have not yet read it ( I'll get round to it ) . But I can tell you now that her version of events tells it from the point of view of the women and how their conspiring and unloyalty brought about the end of Camelot . For a legend with so many incarnations this angle was quite refreshing . It's far from a woman's film though . It does , however , a lot of love story in it . But it's the kind of love story where you know what the characters are thinking and what they feel rather than just something rudely stapled on to appeal to the women . Mists of Avalon is also wonderfully shot and has many scenes of unique atmosphere . All of this , obviously , is backed up by Lee Holdridge's utterly beautiful score . A dozen great themes and moods played out to various emotions . Definitely one of the best scores ever , methinks . Like I have said , there are loads of movies to choose from regarding this legend . But Mists of Avalon is the best I have seen so far . So I recommend that you choose this ' un . The DVD is in great-looking 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound . Some slight extras , including deleted scenes , are on there too .

37,"Text1: Too much and yet too little I have no idea what anyone was thinking when this film was done . I am a huge fan of Tyrone Power but I can't say he was very good in this . I honestly don't think it was his fault . The script was rotten . First of all , the beginning scenes , showing the romance between Katie and Paul , seemed totally like they were from another film and just slapped on at the beginning . Incredibly disjointed . I could never figure Katie out , nor did I want to . People compare the role to Scarlett O'Hara , and I guess there were similarities . I think one of the problems is that we didn't see enough of their characters before they hit South Africa so the love story could really develop for the audience . He kissed her on the staircase . Okay , so what then ? "" Was I just some girl you kiss and leave ? "" she asks . Is that all he did ? Or did he have sex with her and leave ? Hello , it makes a big difference . It seemed to me that all she did was throw herself at him , and I never got the impression that he loved her . Good case in point was the scene where her neck and shoulders were sore and she was stretching , etc . It took him about an hour to take the hint . Her abuse of the Richard Egan character was ridiculous . One ends up losing respect for both of them . Henry King usually does a great job , and of course , the action scenes are very stirring , but the characters all seemed remote . It's possible Fox did this movie to use blocked funds in Africa . I can't think of any other reason . I read on this board that Victor Mature was supposed to play Kurt . Well , Robert Mitchum was supposed to play Paul , but he wisely never showed up and the studio got Power , who was in a hurry to finish up his contract with that place . Filming had already started . Mitchum would have seemed even less interested in Katie , and Victor Mature would have come off as even more of a fool , so it probably worked out for the best . Well , it did for those actors , anyway .


Text2: poignant film , Nelson and Jeanette's best "" Maytime "" is , I believe , the most popular film of that very popular singing team of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald . The story , based on the Romberg operetta , tells the story in flashback of a beautiful young opera singer ( MacDonald ) , under the wing of her teacher ( John Barrymore ) who in spite of herself falls in love with a baritone ( Eddy ) though she's promised to marry her teacher . She chooses loyalty and career over true love , with tragic results . This isn't the most feminist film you'll ever see , as the elderly Miss Morrison ( MacDonald ) tells her story to a young woman who wants to throw her boyfriend over and pursue her career in New York . Nevertheless , it's the setting for a touching tale and gorgeous music sung by MacDonald and Eddy . MacDonald was beautiful and a fine actress , and she had parts of her voice , particularly the middle range , that were absolutely beautiful . Her high notes and singing technique - well , not so great . Some of it was the way female singers were taught to sing "" white "" high notes - backing off of them and straightening the tone , and part of it was the unsophisticated recording devices . The difference in placement between her voice and Eddy's , who sang a frontal placement all the way up , is remarkable . The montages show the great female star singing Trovatore and Wagner - not with that lyric coloratura voice , she wasn't . Eddy sings magnificently throughout , though he was never the presence that MacDonald was . Have some tissues ready . It's a lovely story , and the acting is very good . MacDonald is very touching and Barrymore is appropriately villainous and also underplayed , for those who think he was a big ham . It's one of those films you'll always remember , especially the ending , and that's what the film is about - remembrance .

Text2: My mom didn't like this movie , but I didn't mind it ( although I wouldn't have given it Best Picture ) .

Then , some unexpected events force him to have to decide whether to continue his non-violent life or return to violence . It seems to me that "" Malcolm X "" deserved Best Picture more than this one did , but Eastwood certainly turns in a captivating performance , as do Gene Hackman , Morgan Freeman , and Richard Harris .

Undeservedly obscure , THE MEANEST GAL IN TOWN boasts plenty of pre-Production Code sauciness and several funny performances . It is a good example of a very competent little comedy which fell through the cracks into movie limbo . At the heart of the film , ZaSu Pitts & El Brendel make unlikely , but completely compatible , comedic companions . Fluttery fingered & vague , Miss Pitts brings her considerable experience into playing a businesswoman who is very tired of waiting ten years for her beau to propose marriage . Gentle , good-natured dialect comedian Brendel - the Swedish accent was fake - enlivened a handful of early 1930's films with his genial humor . He was always enjoyable to watch and his performance here is no exception , as he portrays a fellow whose greatest ambition is to have enough clients to enable him to add a second barber chair to his shop . James Gleason scores as the local ladies ' man , always ready with the sly innuendo . Pert Kelton practically steals the show as the flirty tart who knows how to get exactly what she wants from most men . Skeets Gallagher is perfect as the brash salesman who almost trumps her ace .

The mobsters came up against the Columbian mob led by Miguel Sandoval when they accidentally whacked his father . They didn't really , but that part of the humor in this film .

Text2: You'll love it or hate it . I remember "" Natural Born Killers "" making a huge fuss when it was released because the media and conservative families were in an outrage over the level of "" glorified violence "" in the film . To some extent they were right - - the violence isn't glorified but much of it is unnecessary . The movie could still be a brilliant satire of society / the media without going into such graphic detail - - it's been proved in cinema before that sometimes seeing less is better than gratuity . If Oliver Stone's movie has one outstanding flaw , it's the lack of subtlety . That said , if you can handle the level of violence and take it tongue-in-cheek , "" Natural Born Killers "" is so bizarre and funny that it's worth the "" trip . "" ( Pun intended . ) This is a crazy drug odyssey that would have made Hunter S . Thompson look like Ronald Reagan . The film is twisted , outlandish and out of its mind - - Oliver Stone has gone stone-cold crazy and it's awesome . Despite my reservations about his lack of subtlety , there is a flip side to the coin : It is a story about excess . Stone's film-making has gone somewhat awry over the years ( look at the pointless excess of his films after this ) , but this fits the bill because it IS a story of excess . Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play the titular "" Natural Born Killers , "" Mickey and Mallory , a pair of crazy serial killers who both suffered traumatic childhoods and are now rampaging America on a literal killing spree . After they are finally apprehended , the media has by now turned them into such icons and glorified personalities that the public and media seems to respect them as titans of filth . This is where the social satire of the film comes into play , essentially saying : We focus more on the killers than the heroes . I do think it's a bit hypocritical of Oliver Stone to attempt to point this out , as he is a die-hard liberal at his core and , as the controversy surrounding this film's release proved , the conservatives are too conservative to praise killers . It seems to be the liberal media that glorifies violence ( to some extent of course ) so I thought Stone would be the last person to ever criticize the media . So yes it does come across as somewhat of a moot point but nevertheless the film is still enjoyable despite its sometimes sickening amount of over-the-top violence ( the opening sequence of the Director's Cut is stomach-turning ) . The cast is superb - Rodney Dangerfield , Robert Downey Jr . , Tommy Lee Jones , Tom Sizemore , Edie McClurg ( the rental car agent from "" Planes , Trains and Automobiles "" and Rooney's assistant in "" Ferris Bueller "" ! ) and Denis Leary and Ashley Judd in deleted scenes included in the Director's Cut . The story was conceived by Quentin Tarantino ( and it's very similar to his "" True Romance "" script - - a sort of modern-day "" Bonnie and Clyde Redux "" ) and re-written by Stone ( much to the chagrin of QT ) . I'm not sure which would have made for a better film but , despite its flaws ( which are mainly a none-too-subtle message and too much violence ) , "" Natural Born Killers "" is a sort of bizarre , outlandish masterpiece of drugged-out cinema . - -

FRANK SINATRA's voice was in a warm and mellow tone when he did IT HAPPENED IN BROOKLYN and this little musical uses him musically in a nice way . He gets to warble an invigorating ditty as a serviceman joyous to be back in Brooklyn , so he belts out "" Brooklyn Bridge "" with baritone finesse . It almost sounds like a number out of ON THE TOWN . But it's his mellow rendering of "" Time After Time "" that brings back memories of how he crooned his way to stardom and became a teen idol in the early ' 40s . Frank is a kind of shy guy here , but gets to loosen up after awhile thanks to the friendship of JIMMY DURANTE as a fellow Brooklynite , a janitor who lets Frank share his apartment until he can find a job . KATHRYN GRAYSON is the pretty girl Sinatra takes up with , both of them with singing aspirations . He even does a "" Don Giovanni "" duet with Grayson and it's not bad at all . Grayson does a nice solo spot on "" The Bell Song "" from Lakme and handles her acting chores in a pleasant enough manner . Likewise , even PETER LAWFORD gets to belt out a number for a bunch of record fans in a music store , loosening up to a little ditty called "" Whose Baby Are You ? "" with a swing beat . Durante and Sinatra have fun on a number called "" The Song's Gotta Come from the Heart "" and Sinatra is at his best crooning a ballad called "" It's the Same Old Dream . "" True , it's all rather formula as far as the storyline goes , but it's done in such an unpretentious way that it manages to charm most of the time . GLORIA GRAHAME has a small role at the beginning as a nurse from Brooklyn who doubts whether Sinatra hails from that borough . I can't say much for the direction of Richard Thorpe . It moves at a snail's pace through its running time of one hour and forty-five minutes .

This is an impressive , detailed behind-the-scenes story on the various screen versions of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA , described by narrator Scott MacQueen as "" a darkly romantic icon of the gaslight era . "" The documentary is a look at the earlier versions of the Gaston Leroux story written in 1910 and made even more famous by the 1925 version starring Lon Chaney and Mary Philbin . MacQueen's commentary guides the viewer through the other projects - - the 1930 sound version with which Universal hoped to make another big profit after the success of the silent film . Bits of the sound version can be heard here for the first time . SUSANNA FOSTER and TURHAN BEY both talk about their roles in the 1943 film in which they appeared with NELSON EDDY and CLAUDE RAINS . Jessica Rains , the actor's daughter , recounts some amusing bits of trivia about her father . Film historian RUDY BEHLMER adds some other interesting tidbits about the making of the various versions . Although other actors were considered first for the role of The Phantom , CLAUDE RAINS was between contracts at Warner Bros . and was thus available to take the role , only insisting that the make-up for the disfigured genius not be too severe . Interesting to note that the 1925 set was refurbished for the 1943 version and used regularly since then , a set that Universal has recycled many times over the years and is still standing . Well researched and very interesting , it's a valuable addition to the DVD of 1943's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA , covering a wealth of material and a short history of the Universal studio as the maker of horror films featuring stars like Bela Lugosi , Lon Chaney , Jr . , Basil Rathbone and others .

There's a very creepy atmosphere in THE RED HOUSE and although the film is rather slow in getting its story started , beginning as it does in rustic daylight scenes , the mood soon changes - - as does Miklos Rozsa's evocative background music - - and we know we're in for a psychological suspense tale grounded in the usual film noir ingredients . Robinson is a man hiding a secret - - and when he becomes violently upset when someone suggests taking a short cut through the woods near The Red House - - it's only a matter of time before all the focus of the film becomes drawn to the house and whatever secrets it hides . His daughter Meg ( ALLENE ROBERTS ) is attracted to a young man who comes to work on the farm ( LON McCALLISTER ) and it's he who first suggests taking a short cut . Curiosity gets the best of the girl and her suitor and before long the story takes a number of unexpected twists and turns . JUDITH ANDERSON lends her impressive presence to the role of Robinson's wife and Rory Calhoun and Julie London ( who later had quite a bit of success as a pop singer ) are competent enough in supporting roles . But most of the credit for the success of the film in creating the proper mood goes to Robinson , who is excellent here , and to composer Miklos Rozsa who delivers a superb background score that heightens the melodrama .


Text2: The Ultimate Fad Movie "" Forrest Gump "" is the ultimate fad movie . It came out big in 1994 and created a cultural sensation . It was easy to get swept up in its panorama of American cultural history , and all of the iconic imagery in the film made it seem like it was saying something important . But all these years later , this treacly piece of rubbish is nearly intolerable . The film is full of easy sentiment and false emotion . It depicts one thing after another ( the Kennedy assassination , Vietnam , Watergate , the AIDS crisis ) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience , so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective . But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack , I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make . Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him ? Are we supposed to emulate him ? Is the message that we all make life too complicated , and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter , like love of country , God and our dear ol ' mama ? If so , gag . Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film , and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along , I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have . But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny , played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn , who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being , despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out . This movie is like a box of chocolates . . . too much of it and you'll be sick .

In fact , Moore is an advertising executive who unwittingly runs into a person involved in deadly political games ? model Claudie Lange ( who , amusingly , is depicted as being constantly famished ! ) . Incidentally , her equally attractive aunt ( Martha Hyer ) is revealed to be the chief villainess of the piece ( along with Bond-Moore's future superior ' M ' himself , Bernard Lee ! ) intent on assassinating a visiting South African leader ? as always in the most public of places ( in this case , Hyde Park ) and synchronized to take place during the customary 21-gun salute . Two other very obvious borrowings from NORTH BY NORTHWEST are a helicopter chase ( imitating the legendary crop-dusting sequence ) and the rather funny disruption of a church wedding recalling the auction scene in the Hitchcock classic where Cary Grant was similarly drawing attention to himself in order to stall his pursuers ! Also in the cast are Alexis Kanner as a would-be decadent lord who actually advocates peace and ultimately emerges to be on the side of the good guys , as well as Hammer regular Francis Matthews playing a hit-man for Hyer { sic } . Moore having just come off "" The Saint "" ( a series in which director Rakoff was also involved ) , this still has that bland TV look to it ? despite the rather incongruous Swinging London backdrop . The film includes mild dollops of style , wit , sexiness , action and suspense ? all of which were prime features of NORTH BY NORTHWEST in particular , but which were also part and parcel of the Bond saga . In the long run , taken on its own merits , CROSSPLOT is a harmless time-waster but one that has added value if seen as a transition between Moore's trademark personae i . e . Simon Templar aka "" The Saint "" and James Bond aka 007 .

46,"Text1: Magical Music . Dire Directing U2 are my all time favourite band . I absolutely loved the band as a teenager in the early 1980s . I've gone off them slightly as their musical direction changed in the mid 80s and beyond . This is by no means a criticism of their musical progression , they're a band who pride themselves on progression and never get into a musical rut . In the early 80s they were about the only major act who wore their guitar sound on their sleeve . In the 1990s when the musical world was polarised between American grunge and Britpop Bono and the boys were banging on synths . Not quite dance music , not quite guitar rock but something idiosyncratic and unique . But the fact remains in creative terms I rate their early stuff as their best . I bought UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY as soon as it was released on video in Britain in the Summer of 1984 , but never got round to sticking it in the VCR on the day of purchase due to a power cut . Anyway the stuck it in my video the next day and UABRS starts with cut shot of Denver where the concert almost never took place . A massive torrential downpour spoils the occasion , roadies with brushes sweep excess water from the stage and the audience look like they've just been swimming with dolphins "" Bob Dylan did it and they called it hard rain and this is what you've got here so you're all part of history "" says a man addressing the audience . Seeing as he puts a brave face on a bad climatic situation no doubt he's now working as a spin doctor So Bono and company come on a launch into Surrender . This is what I love about this video today , here we see tracks that don't get played anymore like Seconds , A Day Without Me , I Threw A Brick and 11 O ' Clock Tick Tock . And there's two classic tracks , Sunday Bloody Sunday where Bono rightly proclaims "" This song is not a rebel song "" and my all time favourite U2 track I Will Follow . This song always used to get played at the under 18 disco when I was a teenager and it was the one song guaranteed to get everyone up on their feet dancing . If you're young and have a pulse this track will make you feel alive . My one criticism of the video is that it's rather poorly directed by Gavin Taylor . The Red Rocks amphitheater has burning torches and everytime the camera cuts after there's been a long shot of the stage there's a very irritating flame after image on the next shot . In fact the cutting between scenes is very very haphazard and we often get a close up of Bono's bottom ! Maybe some people think that's a good reason to buy the video but I don't . Likewise much of the camera work is very shakey , oh and seeing as the concert was filmed during a downpour more often than not the camera lens has raindrops and condensation covering it . But that's not a big enough criticism for not watching UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY . If you're a casual fan of the band you'll love this concert . Hope to see this on DVD soon with the omitted tracks lke Out Of Control and Twilight includedOn a trivia point the track Gloria differs slightly from the version included on the album of UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY . Compare the bit where Bono says "" This is Red Rocks . The rocks "" and the guitar blast when he says "" This is the Edge "" to see what I mean

If he'd wrote that he'd decided to become a cadger that would have made more sense "" We also hear lines like "" If he has become a badger he might be useful for once , just think of the paint brushes we can make out of his bristles "" . Lines like this point out that the Celts have the greatest sense of humour in the world .

Cooper and Stanwyck fall for each other and wind up getting married , while the hoodlums are swept up by the authorities . This is a very funny movie with romantic undertones . It's not outrageously funny . It's not the Marx Brothers . The high Amusement Quotient is due mostly to the characters and the relationships between them . The romance lies in the development of characters . It's unnecessary , and maybe self defeating , to spell out the funny parts and the gags . So let me mention in passing a scene that isn't funny at all but rather touching . The seven dwarfs are sitting around a table , drinking wine after dinner , anticipating Cooper's marriage to Stanwyck tomorrow . Cooper is bemused by his own emotions and by the prospect of physical contact with a woman . Only one of the professors , Robert Haydn , was ever married and is now twenty-four years a widower . He offers Cooper advice from his own marital experiences and , man , it harks back generations . "" We went to the Catskills where we did some very pretty watercolors . "" And : "" A wife is like a flower . We must wait for the petals to open . A bee too anxious to pollinate might spoil the bloom . "" Something like that , anyway . Havelock Ellis was more straightforward than that . So was Tiny Tim . But after giving Cooper his fatherly advice , Haydn takes out a locket and removes a lock of Genevieve's golden hair , and the others begin to sing "" Genevieve , "" and rather suddenly we realize the film has lost its comic tone and has turned rather touching , as Haydn dabs a handkerchief at his cheek , begs the others to sing it again , and delicately leaves the table . Oh , it's corny alright . ( "" Corny "" , means old fashioned , countrified - - but it's not "" synonymous with ' baloney ' "" . ) But Haydn's sentiment and the sympathy of the other tender-minded old clowns seems genuine enough . We know exactly what Haydn is feeling , although the scene isn't overextended or overwritten . Once Haydn is gone , the others shrug off the hopelessness of their ever having such a relationship , and they lapse into a resigned but robust version of "" Gaudeamus Igatur . "" It may be Barbara Stanwyck's best role . She's unforgettable . In other films she often seems to be made of cast iron , sexless and driven . Here , she's light hearted and saucy . Best shot - - Sugarpuss knocks unexpectedly on Potts ' door and when he opens it , she smiles like a T . rex , her head tilted , clicks her tongue and snaps her fingers , and says , "" Hi , Pottsy , old boy ! "" , and then tilts her head the other way and sweeps past him in this glittering gown , sparkling with Gustav Klimt designer speckles . ( In a few moments she has him feeling her foot and looking down into her open mouth . Watch out , Pottsy , this babe has been known to bite . ) She's pretty foxy too , sashaying around , fluffing her long curly locks , swinging her hips , fomenting rebellion among this flock of troglodytic dodos , teaching Cooper what yum-yum is . A number of Hawks ' movies derive their humor , and sometimes their dramatic tension , from the conflict between the cerebral cortex and the reptilian brain . The eggheads versus the naturals . And that's the case here . An ordinary viewer is more likely to cheer Cooper when he throws away his boxing book and tackles Dana Andrews swinging as recklessly as a kid in a schoolyard fight . Well , we're all glad to see it finally happen . Yet I wonder if that's such a good lesson to learn . In addition to its other many functions , the cerebral cortex has a prominent role in damping down the impulses generated by more primitive structures . That's what keeps us from murdering each other . It ' nice that Cooper manages to let himself go , but it's important to remember that the

In fact , I have now finally seen a movie that was worse than last years "" 28 Days Later "" , in fact after seeing this one I feel bad about being as hard on that movie as I was . I give this movie a three only because at least it has good performances . . . still those performances cannot make up for the fact the plot was awful , it was dreadfully boring , and the ending was very predictable . . . I think I got it five minutes in when I saw their community resembled an amish village , and I was 100 % sure once the origin of the creatures is revealed . The movie is totally devoid of humor , it takes itself seriously to a fault , and quite frankly it would not scare a child of three or four years old . The only reason it is so highly ranked here at imdb is that M . Night directed it so people feel they have to like it , but he isn't a god and so I say this movie is just a mistake by him . Why he can not make a movie without the twist ending is beyond me . Next time he should just make a straight horror movie with no twists at the end and that would probably surprise people more than this one did . I mean if you did not see this one coming you probably have problems concentrating , but then who could blame you ? This movie is very tedious and if you can manage to keep awake through the whole thing you will say "" so that is it ? "" You would have been better off sleeping . There are also more holes left unfilled than can be found in a piece of swiss cheese . It also irked me that Phoenix is basically not even in the second half of this film . All in all a grave disappointment , a movie that looks like a made for television movie presented by the Lifetime channel . If this scares you seek medical help .

Text2: I Remember the Strange Circumstances In Which I Saw This From 1987-88 I used to attend the James Watt College in Greenock . I got there by by traveling on a ferry from Rothesay to Wemyss Bay and then catching a bus from Wemyss bay to Greenock . Unfortunately one day I returned from Greenock to Wemyss Bay there was a gusty wind which meant the ferry to Rothesay was cancelled and I had no money for a hotel . Fortunately myself and several other hapless travellers were allowed to stay in the Cal Mac ( the Ferry operators ) office for the night , there were cups , a kettle , T-bags and a television so we , the captive audience , sat back to watch DOWN WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM Since the drama was mostly set in Greenock ship yards I recognised the locations at once . Strange as it may seem I had no idea who the lead actor was . I'd never seen MEAN STREETS or TAXI DRIVER at this point in my life while RESERVIOR DOGS , PULP FICTION and THE PIANO were still to be made so the name Harvey Keitel meant nothing to me . My comrades for the night laughed out loud but I wasn't too impressed , it's a very low concept drama featuring Keitel's tough shore patrol policeman married to a Scottish girl with lots of domestic angst . Nothing much happens though I do congratulate Peter Mcdougall for pointing out that Americans stationed at The Holy Loch military base weren't very popular with the locals . It was very , very common for serious fights to break out between Scots and Americans at weekends Oh and I think Dinky Donk is having a laugh

The rules have been changed to preclude nominees from being part of a series or conceived originally for television from being eligible . I personally think this is an excellent short and while I understand the logic behind the rules change , I consider it a shame nonetheless . The success of this short led to a series called Courage the Cowardly Dog , one of the better series in a line-up of series that is widely variable as to quality ( some of it quite good , all too much of it poor indeed ) and is well worth watching .

Text2: 90 minutes in the company of a completely horrible person I want to say at the outset that this is a great documentary . Its much better than the 7 I gave it , but I had to knock it down a few because its subject matter , Troy Duffy , is so incredibly unpleasant I never want to see him again . This is the story of Troy Duffy a man who managed to become the hottest guy in Hollywood for all of six minutes before it all went away and left him with nothing thanks to his own wonderful personality . The documentary , made by two ex-friends , takes him from the first glory days as Troy signs with Miramax to have his script produced with him directing , with perks and it follows as it all unravels at lightning speed and he's left with . . . nothing . The footage , shot by "" friends "" with unimagined access , shows Troy as he tries to get his movie made while his ego explodes . Troy can't shut up , or if he can he doesn't know when to . He is one of the most foul mouthed people I've ever seen with even the simplest of sentences peppered with four or five f-words . At first he seems ballsy and no nonsense but rapidly he becomes drunk , gruff and unpleasant with his tell it like it is ( or how he feels ) attitude becoming a bludgeon to everyone around him . Many friends fall away . The film makers , who were friends , apparently admitted that on some level the film is skewed by their dislike for Duffy , but seeing as there is so much footage of Duffy in action , the amount of film / tape showing him in a good light has to be infinitely small . He's an ill mannered jerk , whom even his brothers seem to think will screw up . And screw up he does as the film goes into "" turn around "" and he's forced to come up with Plan B as his money and "" power "" begins to drop away . I don't want to say more since what happens is the movie . Its a brutal , ugly , unpleasant and uncomfortable story . Its 90 minutes with a jerk and its compellingly watchable ( only once since he's too hateful to experience more than that ) . Troy Duffy will forever be the yardstick by which Hollywood jerks are measured .

Text2: Peerless "" Brideshead Revisited "" is an 11x50 minute ( approx ) TV miniseries which takes the viewer into the lives of the residents of a magnificent English country house and sprawling estate called Brideshead , the ultra-rich Flyte family of Lord and Lady Marchmain , and a much welcomed interloper , Charles Ryder ( Jeremy Irons ) , of a somewhat lesser class . The film follows Ryder for two decades from his early years at Oxford to his return to Brideshead as a soldier during WWII . It opens with Ryder's return , then flashes back for most of the 11 hour run where it explores the relationships , exploits , misfortunes , adventures , and generally the lives of the very rich Flytes while fleshing out some deliciously peculiar side characters and peering deeply into the way of the English upper-crust . There's little to fault between the credits of this leisurely and expansive masterpiece which winds circuitously from Brideshead to Venice , Morocco , Central America , Paris , and New York ever tracing Ryder's footsteps through sumptuously appointed period settings and the stately halls of Brideshead ( Castle Howard ) .

55,"Text1: Another Stark Thriller from John Frankenheimer John Frankenheimer ( who died not very long ago ) left us with a terrific repertoire of films , yet I don't hear his name mentioned often in discussions about influential American directors . "" Seven Days in May "" seems to be all but forgotten ; at least , I don't know anyone who's seen it or even heard of it . But it's a terrific political intrigue film , its impact lessened only somewhat by the release of "" The Manchurian Candidate "" two years earlier . There's no mistaking the John Frankenheimer style : the sharp black and white cinematography , stark sets and lighting , claustrophobic compositions . Faces are framed in extreme close-up to completely dominate the screen . He uses deep focus effectively ; two characters will be having a conversation in the foreground , but a third will be constantly in view in the background , as if to suggest that every whispered secret has the potential to be overheard . This style is fabulously on display in "" Candidate "" and is reprised here in "" Seven Days in May . "" Frankenheimer makes great use in both films of TV screens : a character will be simultaneously in view of the film's camera and projected on a screen within the world of the film , giving the movie viewer different angles of the same scene both literally and figuratively ; since media plays a role so frequently in his movies , Frankenheimer constantly draws our attention to its existence and the power it has to manipulate what we perceive to be the truth . As for the performances , there is no improving on Fredric March's understated interpretation of an ailing president , stuck in the dilemma of acting in what he thinks is the country's best interests even though the country itself is rejecting his beliefs . Burt Lancaster does his usual steely Burt Lancaster thing as the film's villain and Kirk Douglas meets him line for line as a subordinate who begins to doubt his boss's integrity . Ava Gardner gives a somewhat weird performance as the film's lone female character ; she walks through the film as if drugged , but it works . And Edmond O'Brien won an Oscar nomination as a hot-tempered southern senator and friend to the president , somewhat curious since March's performance of all of them seems ripe for Academy consideration . "" Seven Days in May "" isn't as taut a film as "" The Manchurian Candidate , "" and it's more heavy handed in its political agenda ( this severely dates the film ) , but it's still a rousing good time and comes highly recommended .

The story is the relationship that develops between both of these people , while the girl's miserable boyfriend encourages her to steal jewelry from the judge so that they can both flee and rid themselves of foster homes permanently . If this isn't enough , the judge , played admirably by Jaclyn Smith , finds the father , a widower , who couldn't cope following the tragic death of his wife when Sally was 3 .

After mixing some chemicals she becomes very excited yelling that she just discovered the greatest secret in the history of mankind . As she runs upstairs to check out what composite of the formula she just discovered is Ingeena gulps it down , thinking that it's some kind of new and exotic jungle fruit drink , and then suddenly goes bananas breaking out of the basement and attacking and killing Dr . Johnson . The movie "" Son of Ingagi "" is an all-black comedy horror movie even though one of it's major stars , Laura Bowman as Dr . Jackson , can easily pass for white . The Lindseys , who had everything to gain by Dr . Jackson death , are suspected in not only her murder but later in the deaths of both Dr . Johnson's scheming and criminal brother Zino as well as her lawyer Bradshaw . Whom both the wild and crazy jungle ape-man Ingeena murdered . Robert & Eleanor moving into Dr . Johnson's home have no idea that Ingeena is roaming around and raiding the ice-box and stuffing himself with baloney and salami sandwiches while no one was looking . Having detective Nelson put on the case he always screws things up by sleeping on the job and trying to help himself to a free meal which the clever Ingeena always beats him to . Ingeena for his part starts to take a strong liking for Eleanor whom he then kidnaps and brings down to his secret hideout , the Lindsey's basement , to have a good time with . Being so enchanted with Eleanor's beauty the absent-minded Ape-man doesn't realize that he knocks over a gas lamp setting the basement and entire house on fire , Robert looking for Eleanor and noticing that there's smoke coming out from behind the wall of his bedroom goes together with the just awakened and totally bewildered Det . Nelson to the basement . After finding and slugging it out with Ingeena Robert rescues Eleanor and makes it out of the house and right into the arms of the police , lead by Det . Nelson's boss Chief Graves . It turns out that the apparently burned to death hero Det Nelson staggers out of the bushes with two sacks full of gold coins and nuggets that Dr . Johnson had hidden in her house . Robert & Eleanor thinking that they lost everything that the had in the world are now , with the gold belonging to them because of Dr . Jackson's last will and testament , rich and can start a new life and finally put the unpleasant and deadly episode that they had with ape-man Ingeena behind them .


Text2: A very strange early effort from Argento REVISED for OFFICIAL DVD release I finally got my hands on a copy of this and watched it last night , and it's not Argento's best or worst , but it's definitely a mystery to me why it's not "" officially "" released . A rock drummer is embroiled in some mystery after it appears that he's killed a man that seemed to be following him , and a mysterious person with a strange mask apparently also caught his deed on film . For he has received copies of the pictures . Now , there's something going on with his wife ( Mimsy Farmer ) and a house guest or two that seem to get in the way of this crazed killer , as well as a few moments of comedy with a gay private detective and a postman that won't go near their house after being assaulted . This is also full of seminal Argento weirdness , and stylish killings and camera work . Along with a few red herrings and nifty twists . Also most bizarre is the bit about a special laser camera that can film images on a deceased person's retina after death , which comes up with a photograph of what appears to be ( wait for it ) four flies . Sadly though , the print I have is a bit blurry and the sound a bit sub-standard , but still it was interesting to see , and could highly benefit from an official release ( hear that , Anchor Bay ? ) And unfortunately this "" warts and all "" print was a bit distracting to watch , so I know I didn't get the full impact of the film . Still though , worth seeking out for rabid Argento fans . . Now that "" Four Flies On Grey Velvet "" has officially been released on DVD in the US , I have to say that the print is beautiful , and clear , but the English track seems to have some surface noise . The Italian track doesn't , it seems , but there are no subtitles , for whatever reason . Upon a second viewing , I still like this film , but it seems to be the most disjointed of all Argento's efforts . It does have some stylized scenes of the killer ( unseen ) wielding various instruments of death with almost comic movements as they are used on the victims , which is something that came up in later films as well , and is a strange and unsettling effect . The new DVD also has a couple scenes that were missing from the US release ( theatrical , I guess , since this was not on home video ) that are presented in the original Italian with English subtitles , and one has to wonder why these scenes were removed , as they are definitely not anything offensive . Still , though , , not Argento's best but still pretty good and despite the crackly sound , the new DVD is worth having .

61,"Text1: A Superb Hitchcock Thriller with a Healthy Dose of His Typical Playful Humour Hitchcock was working at the top of his game in this dazzling thriller . Only he could create movies like this , that blend elements of romantic comedy and dark , grim realism to make something completely unique . Joel McCrea , an actor I've begun to like more and more , plays a writer who travels to Europe with the purpose of reporting on the gathering clouds of war . Once there , he falls for the daughter ( Laraine Day ) of a respected official ( Herbert Marshall ) whose peace organization happens to be a cover up for a spy ring . This ring stages the assassination of an important political figure ( Albert Basserman ) and then kidnaps him to wring secrets from him that will benefit the German army . But McCrea figures this out long before anyone else , and the race is on . "" Foreign Correspondent "" is filled with dazzling Hitchcock set pieces , beginning with the assassination itself , which segues into a race through a sea of umbrellas . There's one of the film's most famous moments , a nailbiting hideout in a windmill , made even more effective by the eerie production design . And the grand finale is an impressive airplane crash into the Atlantic . The supporting cast boasts George Sanders , best known for his portrayal of vicious gossip columnist Addison DeWitt in "" All About Eve , "" playing a quite different and heroic character here , and Edmund Gwenn , unrecognizable without his Santa Claus beard , playing a quite different and villainous one . "" Foreign Correspondent "" maybe feels more like a product of its time than other Hitchcock films , which is maybe also why it seems to be less well known . Like many films from the same time period , it was used both as a piece of entertainment and war propaganda . The last scene finds McCrea delivering a radio address to the American people urging them to pay attention to the dark cloud of war descending on Europe . The speech is quite stirring as delivered by McCrea , and the film fades to black as the rumble of the London blitz pervades the soundtrack . One of Hitchcock's best .


Text2: Atrocious Ron Howard , who never met a story he couldn't screw up , takes the delightful holiday cartoon classic and turns it into something gormless , vulgar and awful . The cartoon used imaginative language and iconic animation to create its magical effect . Howard replaces all of that with gaudy art direction and stupid physical humour . The makeup effects are creepy , not cute ; the Whovillians are anonymous drones - - and it doesn't help that they look like half pig / half human lab creations . Jim Carrey , who on paper seems like he would be perfect casting , overplays to the hilt , creating exactly the opposite effect to that inspired by the original droll creation of animator Chuck Jones and actor Boris Karloff . The only positive attribute Carrey could have brought to the film , that rubber face with which he could have created any number of comic moments , is buried underneath heaps of prosthetic makeup . This is a foul , terrible movie , and I can't believe that anyone could possibly like it . How it even rated a 5 . 6 here at IMDb is beyond me .

62,"Text1: "" Hoy cow , the guy's a walkin ' jewelry store ! "" I was cruising the on line cable listings today and came across this unknown title featuring Jimmy Stewart . The description prompted me to tune in and it turned out to be an entertaining hour and a half . Stewart turns in a characteristic Everyman performance as a department store executive whose life is turned upside down by winning a television quiz contest . I was surprised actually , to see how much the story looked like an episode of ' Father Knows Best ' , which premiered only four years later . The Lawrence's ( Stewart and Barbara Hale ) might have been one kid shy , but they wound up with a lot of other things on their mind once the story got rolling . Natalie Wood and Tommy Rettig portray the Lawrence siblings , with Tommy helping his Dad cash in on ' Name The Mystery Husband ' . Somehow I didn't recognize him as the same actor who I grew up with watching Lassie and his ( her ) pal Jeff Miller , but he was only about nine years old here . The story starts out almost too seriously , as Bill Lawrence's boss Woodruff ( Fred Clark ) tries to correct the ratio of salespeople to customers at his store . But when Bill gets a phone call from the Federal Broadcast System to enlist his participation for the game show , the comic antics begin . Stewart's character engages in some obvious physical humor , but when he finally wins the show's big prize , the fun really begins . Soon a parade of prize bearers descend on the Lawrence home with gifts ranging from your standard jewelry to thousands of cans of soup ( Campbell's gets a plug ) , all the way to a palomino pony . After a while it looked like the story was struggling with too many plot elements , as a glamorous looking portrait artist ( Patricia Medina ) was introduced as a burr to the Lawrence marriage . And in an effort to raise the seven grand he would need to cover the taxes on his winnings , Lawrence gets caught up in a raid on a gambling parlor . How the film makers got all of this into a mere eighty five minutes seems a mystery to me now . Something else that brought me back to that great era of the Fifties was that catchy little number ' Ain't We Got Fun ' . I must have heard that dozens of times watching Warner Brothers cartoons back in the day , and you know , I don't think I've ever heard it since . The song bookends the picture in a nicely complementary fashion . With all that going on , it would be worth your while to catch this one when it hits your local cable listings . I found it on the Fox Movie Network today , so that's a likely place to look for it again . The only question I have though , and I kept waiting for this particular game prize to show up , but - what ever happened to the French Maid ?


Text2: Visually stunning hypnotic nightmare ! Despite it's uninspiring title , Ken Russell's "" Gothic "" is actually an intriguing , and uniquely inspiring piece of cinema . Mary Shelly's "" Frankenstein "" is one of the stories that has helped to shape horror cinema , and so the story behind it is guaranteed to interest horror fans . This film isn't exactly the story of how the story came to fruition ; but rather a compilation of ideas surrounding "" what could have happened "" ( but quite clearly didn't ) . The film takes influence from the enigmatic Lord Byron more than anything , and it's always him that springs to mind as we watch the small cast delve into their imaginations , culminating in an orgy of sex and violence . The story is simple , and focuses more on imagery and the ideas behind what is happening on screen . We follow Percy Shelly and his wife to be , Mary ; along with her sister Claire , who travel to the self-exiled home of Lord Byron . While there , the four of them ; along with Byron's biographer , decide to indulge in the art of making up ghost stories . However , the fun gets out of hand when the quintet begins to believe that they have actually created a monster . The film has a very ' intellectual ' flavour , but the fact is that there isn't a lot below the surface of this film . Gothic , to me at least , is a visual treat rather than food for thought - with Ken Russell's imagery providing more than any deep and complex substance . The imagery is stunning , and fits into the film very well . Russell's sets compliment the story excellently , and the atmosphere in which the film takes place is more important than the story itself . Lord Byron's house is almost a character within itself , and when combined with the actual characters ; Russell has provided horror fans with a very surreal film indeed . The cast is excellent . Films with a small cast rely more on their actors , and this film certainly doesn't fall down in that respect . Gabriel Byrne leads the cast , and does an excellent job of holding the film together . Julian Sands , Natasha Richardson , Myriam Cyr and Timothy Spall , who all portray their characters excellently , join him . On the whole ; I can easily see why people dislike this film ; as it's somewhat messy , and doesn't adhere to common horror standards - but if you like your horror different , this is highly recommended .

Text2: Sex according to Julio Medem Has anyone picked up the trend of Spanish film directors ? When they don't have anything better to say , or to present anything worthwhile , they resort to showing sex , preferably , female genitalia , or even male apparatuses , to distract the naive viewer into believing they are watching something artistic . Well , not so . Ethel , a friend who lives in Madrid , and avoids the Spanish cinema like the plague , told me in two words what she believed this film to be about : CHEAP PORNO ! Never were there more clever words spoken ! Julio Medem , might be an intellectual in Spain , but he certainly cannot cut the mustard , as demonstrated by his previous output : Los amantes del circulo polar and Vacas . . . . Only in Spain , or in Europe , for that matter would anyone invest money into these disasters that pass as "" art "" films there as well as here . In the first place , the sex in the film is completely gratuitous and in your face . Paz Vega is an attractive woman , who no doubt will do better than in this movie . Frankly , I have no objection to have Paz Vega showing her charms all the time but the same should be expected of Tristan Ulloa ! So , if the director wants to reveal to us all what Ms . Vega has to offer , how about getting equal time and give everyone a view of what Mr . Ulloa has in store ? If we are going to be fair , then , let it all hang out ! The new Spanish Cinema isn't afraid to bare all to the world , but they don't have a clue what they're showing . Let's hope Mr . Medem talents will help him land a job as the director of the local Playboy , where he could really show it all without subjecting us to trash like this .

Those elements sparked a newfound interest in the nature vs . man genre back in 1975 when "" Jaws "" was first released . It follows the story of a man named Brody ( Roy Scheider ) , the sherriff in a pleasant little town named Amity , which is seated right by the ocean . Nothing ever happens in Amity . It is the same little routine every day for Brody . Wake up , go to work , come home , go to bed , wake up , go to work , etc . . . But all that changes in one moment of disbelief . But after some vicious incidents occur in the water outside his town and home , Brody investigates and finds that the killings were no boating accidents , but shark attacks . After calling in marine biologist Matt Harper ( Richard Dreyfuss ) and hiring a mysterious man named Quint ( Robert Shaw ) , Brody takes to the seas to hunt for the Great White Shark . . . and defeat it . Steven Spielberg got his big break directing this film . It brought him to fame and he since went on to create many more popular movies , including "" Close Encounters of the Third Kind "" and such . But it is his direction that makes this film's tension work so well . Granted , the reason the shark was never shown was because the fake shark robots wouldn't work , but even if they had shown the shark in the beginning , Spielberg still does good here . John Williams ' score is quite possibly one of the best film scores ever performed , ranking right up there with "" Psycho "" and Alan Silvestri's "" Back to the Future "" theme . It is moving , frightening , and all around completely emotional . The thing that is most impressive about the score is that it revolves around a few keys on a piano being hit over and over and over again . Roy Scheider quite possibly gives his best performance ever in this film . He has dropped out of the limelight lately , not being in any films as of recent ; but everyone will remember his performance as Brody in this film . Always . Richard Dreyfuss is also at the top of his game here . I think it is interesting to note that like Scheider , Dreyfuss has not been in many films recently . Maybe it's post - "" Jaws "" effect . I'm not sure . But I know that the only time I've seen a performance as good as his in this film was a little comedy with Bill Murray called "" What About Bob , "" which is an excellent comedy . I read the novel "" Jaws "" by Peter Benchley , and it is one of the few novels where the movie is better . Benchley lost my interest halfway through the book when he stopped talking about the shark at all . He introduces it in the beginning , and uses it a little at the end , but most of the story is all about character development and has nothing to do whatsoever with a great white . That is what is so nice about the film . It keeps character development going while keeping interest in - and not letting the audience forget about - the shark out in the water . All in all , "" Jaws "" is one of the best films ever made . It easily combines horror , comedy , thriller , mystery , comedy and drama into one little bundle called a film . It's a masterfully crafted thriller that never stops delivering . stars - John Ulmer


Text2: Jingle Jangle Jungle As it turned out this was the second in a franchise that no one thought of as a franchise at the time . Hope and Crosby had been teamed with Dorothy Lamour in what was intended as a one-off , Road To Singapore , and when Fred McMurray and George Burns passed on this someone remembered that Road To Singapore had made a little noise at the box office so why not team Hope and Crosby again and throw a ' road ' into the title to remind fickle audiences of Singapore . Things were beginning to fall into place but we weren't there yet ; Hope and Crosby were now established as performers with Crosby as the pitch man and Hope performing the life-threatening stunts and what , in retrospect , turned out to be the main ingredient - the songs - was also in place . With Fred and Ginger no longer a team at RKO someone at Paramount clearly figured there was a gap in the market and you can almost hear the thinking . . . ' what if , they weren't two DANCERS , but two SINGERS , then we add an extra ' girl ' to the mix as a foil for Hope , Helen Broderick is working so why not Una Merkel , she did all right in Destry Rides Again opposite Micha Auer . . . ' Actually the foursome worked quite well but it's the threesome we remember from the rest of the franchise ( excluding the last , Hong Kong ) . We were also becoming used to the kind of jokes that let the audience in - the native chief tells Hope he will be fed to a giant bird which gives Crosby a chance to say ' this time the bird gets you ' . If there are not too many lines as on the money as that the one thing that endures is the songs ; on Singapore Johnny Burke was teamed with Jimmy Monaco but he'd now formed a partnership with Jimmy Van Heusen that would last throughout the forties and into the fifties and during that time they wrote not only all the other ' Road ' pictures but also about 95 per cent of Crosby musicals . They started well here with three fine numbers , You Lucky People You ( if you ever wondered where cockney comedian Tommy Trinder got his catch phrase from look no further ) , You're Dangerous , and the standout ballad It's Always You , plus the almost obligatory title number and it is these songs that will endure even if the films themselves tend to date .

Text2: For me and my gal MGM musicals dominated the genre . No one could make musicals like they could , although a few studios tried with lesser success , as is the case with this one done by Fox in 1942 . Irving Cummings was a director that tried his hands at directing musicals with mixed results . "" My Gal Sal "" is the biography of Paul Dresser , an American composer who wrote tuneful , if somewhat bland songs . The screen play is by Theodore Dreiser , a writer on his own right , but who had nothing to add to make this film work better . This is a musical that has a dated look from the beginning . The situation is preposterous , at best . Rita Hayworth shines as the red headed Sally Elliott , a singing star of the musical theater of the time . She is responsible for the discovery of young and inexperienced Paul . She likes his songs and doesn't hesitate in stealing one to include in her show . Never did the technicolor loved anyone as it loved Rita Hayworth ! She was a beautiful woman who lights up the screen any time we see her . Victor Mature , as Paul , plays an unworldly Paul Dresser . He is a country boy and it shows . It is through his association with Sally that he gets the kind of sophistication he never had . In minor roles James Gleason , as Paul's agent is excellent . This character actor graces with his presence dozens of films where he is always in the background . The great Phil Silvers appears briefly in a couple of key scenes . He was a talented actor of the stage and the screen and television that was always a welcome addition to everything he appeared in . Also , Carol Landis is seen in a small role .

La Boite Noir is something of a disappointment ; it's not so much that the premise is hardly new - victim of amnesia needs to solve the odd mystery or two before he can move on - Mank's Somewhere In The Night in 1948 is a good example of the genre - as that Berry fails to find anything new to explore and there are many finer actors around than Jose Garcia .

If you can , try to get your hands on the Season I DVD set with the special features disc . I was surprised to learn that many of the main and supporting characters beyond Wild Bill and Calamity were in fact also based on real life people . Al Swearengen ran an operation that took in between four and six thousand dollars a night , while other notables with a true history include Doc Cochran and the Reverend Henry Smith . Though the story playing out in the series is often a product of creator David Milch's ' imaginative reality ' , that in no way lessens it's impact as a narrative of the Dakotas and it's overly rich history of villainy , debauchery and profanity . Deadwood itself grew from a small mining camp to ten thousand inhabitants in a dizzying matter of three months in 1873 . Word of a substantial ore find literally led to the phrase ' there's gold in them thar hills ' , creating an endless stream of immigrants to the Badlands . The territory itself was relegated to the Sioux Indians , and the U . S . Government was supposed to keep settlers out . But as everyone knows , money talks . With a series so rich in characters and story lines , it's hard to pick a favorite . Backed against the wall I'd have to pick Brad Dourif's portrayal as Doc Cochran as my own choice , but that's today . Individual episodes offer stunning performances by William Sanderson as E . B . Farnum and Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane . Of course , series stars Timothy Olyphant and Ian McShane have rewritten the rule book for Western heroes and villains with their portrayals . It's too bad Keith Carradine couldn't hang around more than four episodes as Wild Bill Hickok , but he drew those darn aces and eights in Deadwood . Not for the squeamish or faint of heart , "" Deadwood "" remains true to the gritty origins in the mud , blood , manure and urine of it's namesake . Prepare to be shocked , terrified and at times even amused , but most of all , watch "" Deadwood "" to experience one of the most unique television events ever created .

Paul Metrand , Alain Delon , are in for the ride of their lives . It turns out that big time business man Kevin Harrison , Robert Wagner , has been selling arms to countries like North Vietnam and terrorist organizations like Black September to make big bucks regardless of what those arms would do in killing innocent and American lives , like the GI's killed by them in the Vietnam War . About to be exposed by his lover news-reporter Maggie Whelan , Susan Blakely , Harrison plans to get her killed , together with the explosive evidence that she has on her , in a staged airplane accident over the Atlantic Ocean . Try as he may Harrison just can't put the Concorde down as he has heat-seeking missiles F-15 fighter planes and even the ground crew in Paris sabotage the plane in order to blow it out of the sky it's , like in that famous watch commercial , takes a licking but just keeps on ticking . With all his efforts gone by the wayside Harrison watching on TV the happy crew and passengers , including Maggie and the damaging documents , rescued from the snows of the Bavarian Alps , where the Concorde crash landed , he puts a gun to his head and pulls the trigger . The only thing that saves the movie is it's unintentional humor thats a laugh a minute and never lets up until the final credits . There's Soviet star gymnastic champion Alcia Rogov , Andrea Marcovicci , who beside having a wild and secretive affair with handsome TV personality Robert Plamer , John Davidson , gets so excited and carried away with the action on broad the plane that for a moment she completely loses her , phony as it sounded , Russian accent . There's saxophonist Boisle , Jimmy J . J . Walker , who's so stoned on pot that even if the plane crashed and was sent to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean he'd be so whacked out of his skull that Boisle wouldn't even notice that he died . There's Loretta , Martha Ray , who's so nervous of flying especially if the plane she's on is continually attacked , like an USAAF B-17 over Germany in WWII , that she spends the entire trip hiding in the planes bathroom . There's also the totally unexplained ridicules and almost comedic chase scene with airplane mechanic Froelich , Jon Cedan , at the Paris Airport . Froelich who sabotaged the Concorde all of a sudden gets the willies for no reason at all after he drops some cash , that he was paid by Harrison to do the dastardly deed , at an airport medal detection machine . Froelich mindlessly runs and runs around in circles for some ten minutes and tries to either get run over or get on the toeing plane as if he either got a sudden change of heart , and tried to stop it from taking off , or just went off his bird and flipped out because of the pressure he was under . For all the positive publicity that the supersonic jet Concorde got in the movie in how indestructible it is it's days as a passenger plane were numbered . The plane was so noisy , keeping people who lived around airports from sleeping , and expensive , costing as much as $12 , 000 . 00 for a round trip from New York to Paris or London , as well as a threat to the environment , in it's gas guzzling , that it eventually priced itself out of business .

Text2: Everything has gotten so confusing around here that even the gorilla doesn't know who the gorilla is ! ( There are Spoilers ) Wild and crazy gorilla on the loose movie that has the gorilla sending notes to his victims , by vine mail , telling them that they just got 24 hours to live . We never seem to know why the gorilla is targeting those who he eventually does in until the the very end of the movie which , the explanation , is so off-the-wall and confusing that when the movie is finally over your still not quite sure who the killer , or gorilla , is ! With two different people being exposed as being either the gorilla or the gorilla's partner in crime . The gorilla , Art Miles , himself is nothing but an innocent bystander who got caught up with all this monkey business that has to do with an Uncle Stevens , Lionel Atwill , who's been contacted by the Gorilla through his terrified maid Kitty , Patsy Kelly telling him that he'll be dead by midnight ! The gorilla also is heard speaking throughout the movie , without the slightest hint of a gorilla accent , on the radio giving instructions to those trapped , because of a violent thunderstorm , in Uncle Stevens ' mansion . With his niece Norma , Anita Louise , and her future husband Jack Marsden , Edward Norris , coming over for dinner Uncle Stevens has to cancel the engagement and call the Acme Detective Agency to send their best man , or in this case men , Garrity Harrian & Mulligan , the Ritz Brothers , to protect him form the rampaging gorilla . The gorilla seems to know his way around the house and is always a step ahead of the buffoonish as well as defective detectives , Garrity Harrigan & Mulligan , making them look and act more like monkeys then him . The three are then confronted by another gorilla , who has nothing to do with the gorilla's string of murders . This gorilla escaped from his keeper when he was bopped over the head by the other gorilla in order to have his , peaceful and law abiding , gorilla take the rap for the crimes that he committed . To make thing worse Uncle Stevens who hired Garrity Harrigan & Mulligan to protect him and keep the gorilla from getting to him ends up being kidnapped and possibly murdered by the gorilla . There's a whole lot of sub-plots in this movie that has to do with Uncle Stevens mismanaging his clients funds , which may well have been the reason for Stevens to get himself lost , as well as both this mysterious stranger , Joseph Celleia , popping up out of nowhere claiming to be an agent of the SEC , Security & Exchange Commission , who's investigating Uncle Stevens ' unethical financial practices as well . There's also this other weirdo A . P Conway , Paul Harvey , claiming to be one of Uncle Stevens clients whom he embezzled some $250 , 000 . 00 out of . And of course there's the great Bela Lugosi in what seemed like a cameo , even though he's on the screen almost as much as the star of the movie the gorilla , role as Uncle Stevens creepy butler Peter . The Ritz Brothers get to do their thing in making total jerks of themselves and making you wonder if Uncle Stevens , who was crazy enough to hire them , was in fact in on his own kidnapping in order to get away Scot-free with all the money he stole while everyone else , including the local police and SEC , was sent on a wild goose chase . The ending is just too much to even try to explain with the truth coming out about just who the gorilla is and what he was really up to . This all made you wonder if the theory of evolution actually works in reverse with the gorilla , the real not the fake one , being about brightest and the most intelligent person in the film .

Vanity project from writer-director-producer-star Charles Chaplin ( who also composed the music score and actually won a belated Oscar for this in 1972 , due to eligibility requirements ! ) . The film itself is sadly unsuccessful : hammy , sentiment-steeped , yet still unmoving , it uncomfortably catches Chaplin in a self-reverential mood ( he's constantly playing to the camera ) .

Waxwork II : Lost in Time starts with a brief recap of the climax to the original Waxwork ( 1988 ) paying particular attention to the escape of the severed zombie hand , Mark Loftmaore ( Zach Galligan returning from the original ) & Sarah Brightman ( now played by Monika Schnarre ) think they have ended David Lincoln's plan to flood the world with evil & catch a taxi home . Unfortunately the severed hand goes along for the ride too . Once home Sarah goes to bed & the severed hand attacks & kills her Stepfather ( George ' Buck ' Flower ) , Sarah is accused of his murder & is put on trial . Sensing an injustice & that she will be found guilty Mark & Sarah head over to Sir Wilfred's ( Patrick Macnee ) mansion who they discover has left a message for them , they find his hoard of ancient artifacts & something called Solomon's Lockett which turns out to be a key to open doors to alternate dimensions . With the idea that they can gain proof of Sarah's innocence by travelling through time & space they enter a time door & find themselves in Baron Von Frankensteins ( Martin Kemp ) castle facing an angry mob of local villagers who want Frankenstein & his monster ( Stefanos Miltsakakis ) dead & anyone associated with him . . . Written & directed by Anthony Hickox , who also has a small cameo in the film , Waxwork II : Lost in Time is a worthy but not quite as good sequel to the great original . The script is one long homage & send-up to various other horror films but this time there are no waxworks involved . From the likes of Frankenstein ( 1931 ) to Alien ( 1979 ) , Dawn of the Dead ( 1979 ) , Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde ( 1941 ) , an awful Godzilla ( 1954 ) bit complete with terrible dubbing to add authenticity , Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1956 ) , Jack the Ripper ( 1959 ) , Nosferatu ( 1922 ) shot in black and white complete with subtitles & a jerky movement , The Haunting ( 1963 ) , the severed hand attacking Sarah's Spetfather is taken straight from the sequence in Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) when Ash fights his own possessed severed hand & they also come across a blood stained hockey mask at one point . The film moves along like a rocket & each segment provides variety although some get more screen time than others . One aspect where I thought Waxwork II : Lost in Time didn't do so well with was it's uneven tone when it comes to the balance between comedy & horror , one moment it tries to be a proper horror film with scares like the Frankenstein segment is to start with but then it suddenly descends into camp comedy as Baron Frankenstein is strangled his eyes pop out of their sockets & his brain shoots out the top of his head complete with comedy sound effects . The most developed segment is the climax set in medieval times which strangely isn't based on any other film that I can think of , there is a scene in this part where a big fat executioner complete with black hood approaches a woman tied up but instead of whipping or hurting her he pulls a feather out & starts to tickle her ! Director Hickox films with some style & there are some nice moments , some of the scene transitions , some of the angles & it's a good looking film throughout . Forget about any real scares as the comedy stuff dilutes it too much for it to be wholly effective . There is some decent gore , lots of spraying blood , brains , eyes , severed hands , zombies getting their heads shot off , aliens emerging from someones mouth & a guy hanging up with his chest cut open exposing his ribcage . Technically the film is good , some of the sets are a bit limited , it tries to remake Alien using two sets for instance . The special effects range from impressive to poor especially the rubbery looking alien & the awful Godzilla . The acting is campy which suits the material . The likes of David Carradine , Bruce Campbell , Marina Sirtis , John Ireland , Alexander Gudunov & Drew Barrymore all turn up in roles . Waxwork II : Lost in Time is a fun , entertaining film that most horror fans will surely enjoy to some extent . I'm

Text2: "" The Butler's did it . "" Humorous Quincy episode . Quincy M . E . : The Last of Leadbottom starts as Qunicy ( Jack Klugman ) , Sam ( Robert Ito ) & Asten ( John S . Ragin ) are attending the grand opening of a Naval museum named after Quincy's commanding officer during the Korean war , Rear Admiral Burgess S . McKenzie ( Albert Paulsen ) . However shortly after breaking the traditional bottle of champagne to christen the opening McKenzie collapses & dies , Quincy insists on doing the autopsy himself & is perplexed to find a small computer chip in his stomach . As lots of official looking people come out of the woodwork in search of the mysterious chip Quincy's suspicion's are raised that maybe McKenzie was murdered because of it & when McKenzie is accused of selling Naval secrets to the Russians he becomes convinced of it . . . Episode 22 from season 7 this Quincy story was written & directed by Michael Braverman is a pretty fun episode . A lot of season 7 so far has been weighed down with heavy handed social & moral issues but as the season draws to a close the last few have been purely crime driven stories & The Last of Leadbottom is no exception , here Quincy has to solve a murder , becomes involved in Naval espionage & save himself as a lot of dangerous people want the computer chip . One reason I like this episode is that it has a fair amount of humour in it , there are some amusing one-liners here & the final closing joke about ' the Butler's did it ' is actually quite funny in a cheesy sort of way . We learn a little about Quincy's past & his time in the Navy & if your interested in such things he turns out in full uniform on a few occasions . At only an hour or so in length it moves along at a nice enough pace & the while the plot feels a bit rushed at the end with lots of double crossers & false identity's being revealed in a short space of time which felt a bit confusing it's another fine mystery for Quincy fans . There's not much to say about this episode except that if your wondering about the strange sounding title it refers to Admiral McKenzie's boat he used to captain . The recognisable Tom Atkins makes a guest appearance here & does alright . The Last of Leadbottom is a fun Quincy episode with a surprising amount of humour that is actually quite amusing but it also has a neat murder mystery as well , definitely well worth a watch if you want to pass an hour .

Text2: Is there anything that Charlie Chaplin can't do ? The Immigrant is one of Chaplin's early short films , with a very simple story but Chaplin makes it work . The thing that makes this early short film work so well is Chaplin's skill at slapstick comedy , it's so much fun to watch him try to deal with these endless predicaments that he gets into that you don't even pay attention to the simplicity of the story . The majority of Chaplin's early films , particularly the short films like The Immigrant , are little more than brief comedy skits . But the value here does not lie in the story of the film , it lies in seeing how well Chaplin fits the role and how entertaining it is , even by todays standards , to watch his face as he realizes that he has dropped his money , after watching a man get beaten up for being ten cents short . The Immigrant is a classic because it is a Charlie Chaplin film , and really for no other reason . Chaplin makes it work , and he does it extremely well .

Having made many trips to the ballpark in which the movie was filmed , and to the old-fashioned soda shoppe where Robert Redford and Glenn Close re-unite , this movie was special to all of us in Western New York .

He played Professor Bosco , who is the owner of a flea circus , and ( although dressed as an old tramp ) he has a large whip , which he flashes to keep his fleas in line . He has gone to a flop house to sleep , and we watch several incidents during the night from the other tramps and from a dog , and how they interrupt his fleas which are kept in a cardboard box . At the end of the surviving short he has rounded up his fleas and finds it is time to move on . It was supposed to be part of a longer short - but instead it was only ten minutes . There may have been more than that ten minutes but this is all that has been recovered in Chaplin's private film vaults . It is one of numerous cut sequences and hitherto unknown films shot by Chaplin that were shown in the three part series UNKNOWN CHAPLIN on Channel 13 ( which is available on video ) . Whether or not Professor Bosco would have been a successful series or not we'll never know ( Chaplin , apparently , decided it would not work ) . But this sequence did end up ( as pointed out in another review on this thread ) as the model for the later version that appeared in LIMELIGHT .


Text2: Has some potential . . . but little more If you like surrealistic films , like Cocteau's or Salvador Dali's , THE HEARTS OF AGE may appeal to you . It certainly throws symbols around , but it is the work of two teenagers at a prep school , not of a major French 20th Century poet and film maker and a major Spanish artist . When the latter two put in symbols , and repeated them , there was a rhythm and sense in their use - especially as their films were meant to shock or to attack the Church . Here two preppies , William Vance and George O . Welles , are trying to make a surreal movie . It has some nice touches . A hand reaches out of the crypt of a cemetery ( or seemingly so ) to grab a stone marker cross . But it's "" dollar book "" symbolism . In high school I was involved in making a film , and it involved a rare tablet that unlocked hideous power secrets . I suggested , in a scene supposedly shot at a religious altar , that the tablet be placed in a skeletal hand . Disembodied or fossilized hands scare people , and are useful in keeping an audience's attention . That was why I suggested it . From my above reduction of one of the two creators of this film , calling Orson Welles by his first name , I am sort of hinting at the problem at watching THE HEARTS OF AGE . If it's creators were a pair of non-entities we would not care to even consider the film . But it was co-directed by Welles , some three years before "" THE CRADLE WILL ROCK "" , some four years before "" THE WAR OF THE WORLD "" broadcast , and some seven years before CITIZEN KANE . Welles ' creative ascendancy was about to blossom , so we look at this early stunt as full of suggestions of greatness . That's stretching it . It shows potential . Mr . Vance , Virginia Nicholson , and Paul Edgarton do as well with their acting parts as the normal teenagers who are in a school production . It's when Welles shows up that we see more spice in the acting . This is not based on a blind Wellesian hero worship . He shows a subtlety in his playing the part of the mysterious male figure that is lacking in the other three performances . Ms Nicholson seems bad tempered and suspicious at times ( mostly at Mr . Welles ) but she fails to gain our interest or sympathy . Mr . Edgarton as a doomed bell ringer / slave ( he's in black face ) gets some sympathy as he is forced to constantly labor , and eventually he dies by hanging . But the lack of any rational or symbolic reason for this kills the effect of his demise ! Welles obviously was given the best part because he can act . He first appears as a jaunty figure , in top hat and tales . His thin body ( he could not have played this part forty years later ) seems to be springing down various ladders and walks as in a dance . With his pale , bald features he may represent death dancing ( and later playing the piano ) . But is he ? Or is he simply an old man , who is happy to survive his wife ( Ms Nicholson ? ) and buries her quickly when he finds her corpse ? When Pauline Kael did her hatchet job on Welles ' contribution to CITIZEN KANE , she pointed out that his make-up in THE HEARTS OF AGE mirrored the elderly Kane . There is a resemblance , but then keep in mind that in both films we are seeing the frame of Welles ' face covered by a bald wig . So there would be a resemblance anyway . Moreover , Kael was so determined to rob Welles ' Kane performance of any originality that she also found he looked like Peter Lorre as Dr . Gogol in MAD LOVE , a 1935 thriller where Lorre is an insane surgeon terrorizing a crippled pianist ( Colin Clive ) . When Welles was asked about this , he said he never even heard of Lorre's movie before . He probably hadn't . My guess is that any resemblance between Welles ' performance in THE HEARTS OF AGE and CITIZEN KANE are solely due to both characters he played having to age or be old .

The movie was fast paced once they got to the caves and did not let up until the finish . The story has a woman who the previous year lost both a husband and daughter to a very gruesome car accident . She was apparently an extreme sports junkie , but for the past year has been in mourning for the loss of her loved ones . Now , however , she reunites with some old friends and they are going caving , girls only . They are supposed to go to a rather simple cave to explore with no real danger or thrills , however one of the members of the group has decided instead to take them to a cave she discovered . . . and what the girls discover there is sheer terror . This movie was very effective , even before there are any kind of creatures introduced the movie was tense . There is a great scene involving being stuck in a tight place , a really dangers climbing the wall scene and a scene involving a broken leg . I mean the poor girls have virtually no shot at survival at this point then if all this is not bad enough there is something lurking in the caves and it likes to feast on flesh . So there ya go , finally a horror movie that does seemingly indeed put our cast in a virtually inescapable situation with no apparent way out . It is not all good though , I did not care for some of the character's behavior towards the end as I would hope one would rather lean on someone for support . Instead there is a rather shocking scene that to me seems petty . Wait and try to get out then settle differences . Still this horror movie was really good and tense .

Seen today it's a rambling , largely incoherent and unrealistic story of Six Nazis In Search Of A Neutral Country . The bizarre casting does little to help and it was clear that the actors with marquee value , Olivier , Massey , Howerd , were never On Call at the same time . Of these Olivier is by far the worst , an acting joke with an accent that would bring a blush to the cheek of Dick Van Dyke . Eric Portman as the Senior Nazi strikes his one note in frame # 1 and never deviates from or embellishes it throughout . It probably meant something to someone , somewhere back in 1941 but not to your jaded , cynical correspondent in 2008 .


Text2: Amazingly bad This cartoon is about the only animated cartoon series that MIGHT have been as bad as the animated Hercules cartoons of the 60s ( from Trans Lux TV ) . The show was astoundingly bad . So bad that Hanna and Barbera at their lowest point would have refused to put their names on it bad ! So bad that children suddenly remember they have some homework to do when it comes on bad ! The worst aspect of the show was the crappy animation . A slide show would have seemed less wooden and static ! And the stories themselves bore only a superficial resemblance to the cartoon strip . And the dialog , . . . I've read better dialog on ads for zit creams ! If you have Bright House cable , you may be able to see this monstrosity for yourself to see if I am right . It's been listed on their cartoon on demand channel , so if you do have the chance , watch it - - unless you aren't a masochist . Oh , and by the way . Despite what others may have said , the show was NOT faithful in any way to the cartoon strip . It wasn't even close !

81,"Text1: Badly Made Survivalist Shocker I haven't seen DEF-CON 4 for several years and if it's as bad as I remember it I hope to never see it again . The story is grim and lacks credibility . A space station witnesses the third world war and a trio of survivors wait for the radiation levels to drop so they can return to Earth , and when they return they find that the survivors are well armed barbarians where it's survival of the fittest This movie doesn't concern itself with the intellect of post apocalypse authors like John Wyndham or John Christopher , it's trying to be similar in genre to the likes of MAD MAX etc . The problem is that it doesn't have the budget to do so . We see no devastated cities and most of the action takes place in North American woodland which is an obvious budgetery descion on the part of the producers and not a creative one . There probably wasn't much of a movie to start with but if there was the exploitive scenes take it down to an even lower level . For example the hero walks through woodland ( Did I mention most of the action takes place in the sticks ? ) and comes across a bunch of survivors who are carving up a roast dinner - A human leg ! There's another scene with a severed arm and a couple of other gory scenes . I know that the likes of 28 DAYS LATER and THE OMEGA MAN suffer from gaps in logic but at least they're entertaining and enthralling unlike this contrived unsympathetic mess


Text2: I Doubt Very Few People Watching This In 2005 Will Understand It In 1960 Britain was the first European country to scrap conscription . This is not to be confused by the American style draft system because with very few exceptions all able bodied men who turned 18 had to serve two years in the forces regardless of social and educational background . The scrapping of conscription was a good thing because there's nothing more dangerously useless to an army than a soldier who doesn't want to be a soldier I'm pointing this out because that's the concept behind CARRY ON SERGEANT - A professional NCO who receives the worst possible raw recruits into his platoon and you find yourself questioning who you're supposed to feel sorry for the most , the recruits who don't want to be there or the sergeant who doesn't want them there but that wouldn't have been the case when this film was made , a 1958 audience would have related more to the recruits than to the sergeant . This sort of idea will go above the heads of a modern day audience and the film has dated very badly not least because it's the very first in CARRY ON franchise . Anyone expecting sexual innuendos will be very upset to see they're more or less conspicuous by their absence . In fact with the exception of a few cast members like Kenneth Connor , Charles Hawthrey and Terry Scott a lot of people would with hindsight have trouble believing that this was in fact part of the CARRY ON franchise I've got to be honest and say the lack of the CARRY ON trademarks is no bad thing because if double entredes is the selling point of a comedy then 1958 censorship rules would have meant the innuendo would have been curtailed and that would have meant no humour full stop . Instead this is a gentle but ultimately heart warming English comedy featuring a typecast but impressive enough William Hartnell training a platoon he thinks is destined for failure

82,"Text1: The Game Plan is a pretty good Disney family comedy for fans of The Rock When I first saw the preview of The Rock in this formula Disney movie meant to attract families , I sorta cringed . My friend , on the other hand , who loves wrestlers and Disney stuff was very excited to see this one . So it was that we both decided to see this one after playing for several weeks . While watching during many parts of the first hour , I did feel a little wincing during many of the cutesy scenes between the lead character and the little girl who reveals herself as his daughter and thought many of the slapstick scenes were so obvious . But as the story went on and many entertaining set pieces like The Rock and the girl doing ballet in front of nearly all of his teammates , his singing his idol Elvis ' "" Are You Lonesome Tonight ? "" to her , or his teammates with the little girl playing super soaker with him were coming on , I was thoroughly enjoying myself to the point that I was thinking , "" Hey , this is not so bad at all ! "" So on that note , for anyone with families or who just want a good clean comedy , I highly recommended The Game Plan ! With sportscaster Marv Albert and Kyra Sedgwick who's a little amusing as The Rock's agent .


Text2: The Blow Out was an interesting early Tex Avery cartoon featuring Porky Pig The Blow Out was an early Warner Bros . cartoon that was the second made by "" supervisor "" Fred "" Tex "" Avery as director . It also starred Porky Pig in his early incarnation with original voice Joe Dougherty ( who stuttered in real life ) . Other voices featured were Sara Berner who was later gossipy switchboard operator Mabel on "" The Jack Benny Program "" , and Lucille La Verne who later voiced the Queen on Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . She voices the bomber here . Porky is a kid here trying to buy an ice cream soda but finds he's five pennies short . So when he accidentally picks up a misplaced item from a passerby , he gets awarded one cent . After this gets repeated a few times , the pig finds the bomb-which he thinks is just an ordinary clock-and proceeds to give it back to the one who dropped it who of course keeps running away . Soon the cops follow . You may be able to guess what happens from here on but I'm not going to tell you . Needless to say , the ending is one you've probably expected from Tex Avery if you're familiar with his subsequent cartoons for both Warner Bros . and M-G-M . On that note , I definitely recommend The Blow Out .

In fact , this one is too light and frothy , and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat .

It's got religious undertones , making it seem heavy-handed and / or ridiculous to many viewers . Yes , there are an awful lot of very good reasons this movie should suck . . . but it doesn't .

The plot is pretty good , though at times , it's unnecessarily confusing . The pacing is pretty good , the film isn't too long for it's own good and you're fairly rarely bored . The effects are the definite high point in the film , looking exceptionally well . The action is somewhat seldom in the film , and it's mostly very quickly over with . . . but it looks damn good , and it's usually intense and involving .

It's this playing God that in the end jeopardizes the city of Los Angeles when the person in charge of this black ops operation Gen . James Roberts , Martain Sheen , is found out , in what he's really up to , by the two top man running the project Doctors Ron Young & Daniel Platt , Luke Perry & David Moses . It turns out that Gen . Roberts has been involved in weather manipulation since he was in Vietnam and now he's doing it here in the US . This has cost over the years hundreds of people to be killed in a number of man made hurricanes , like Andrews in August 1992 , that the General had created with this gadget of his , an in flight electro magnetic generator , in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . Working secretly with the major oil companies Gen . Roberts is now , without those under him knowing , planning to start up a major five category hurricane , or typhoon , on the west coast of Mexico . This mad plan on Gen . Roberts ' part is to devastate that country and force it to both come to he US for emergency aid as well as stop , which is the real reason of Roberts plan , from nationalizing it's oil wells ! An act that in effect would put the international oil companies , that Roberts is working for , out of business ! Not as far fetched as you would think since manipulating the weather is a fool proof method of causing havoc on a nations population and military establishment without , being that it's an Act of God , those doing it being blamed for it ! And thus rule out military retaliation by the targeted country . It's when both Dr . Young and Platt get wind , no pun intended , of Gen . Roberts insane plan of wiping out an entire Mexican town with it's thousands of inhabitants that they go into action in bringing his mad dream of both controlling the weather and thus the world to an end . Like a genie let out of a bottle once Gen . Roberts plan was set into motion it was almost impossible to stop it . Dr . Platt in refusing to both intensify and then guide , with the electro magnetic generator , the Pacific typhoon to make landfall is murdered , or orders of Gen , Roberts , by his co-pilot before he could guide the storm back to sea . SPOILERS It's now up to Dr . Young who at the time is under arrest , in him being set up by Roberts in a hit and run accident , to both finish the job that the ill fated Dr . Platt started ! With the now rampaging killer storm , with the out of control electro magnetic generator guiding it , heading straight for Los angles it's up to Dr . Young to keep it from making landfall and wiping the city off the map . It's also in Gen Roberts best interest to get Dr . Young freed to do the job or else he'll have to answer for the deaths of thousands of American citizens . What Roberts is also planning is to disappeared , or have murdered , Dr . Young after he completed his mission ! Better then you would expect since we've been hit by a number of 3 4 and 5 category hurricanes , like depicted in the movie , over the last few years since the film "" Storm Tracker "" was released . Like were told in the movie , by non other then the deranged Gen . Roberts , that the weather can be the most effective weapon of mass destruction in history . In that its both impersonal and deathly effective at the same time . It was the very ironic fact that Gen . Roberts grandiose plan of using the weather to achieve his , and those who employ him , aims had finally been made public , by Dr . Young , that had him offed by the very people that he was working for !

Melissa wants at least to have them identified , when found , so that she can put their friends and relatives to rest by not wondering if their alive or dead . At the island there's a ground-breaking ceremony for a low-rent housing project , Hope City , with the city's mayor and multi-billionaire real estate tycoon Rupert King , Malclom McDowell . The hosing development is being built to keep the riff-raft off the city streets and hide them away there from the public for strictly "" humanitariam "" purposes . The fact is that King has other purposes for bringing the city's unwanted there and it's for him getting rich by using them as experiments for the pharmaceutical companies that he owns . You have to have a real strong stomach to sit through this film with people getting attacked by these super flies who not only infect them with their eggs but who cause their victims to burst open and decompose within minutes . The grossed out scenes in the film have countless maggots crawling out of the infected peoples corpses . The mad and arrogant King had been planing to do this for years by using Hart Island as a laboratory and the use poor and unwanted as guinea pigs . Now with him in trouble financially , he had six major failures in a row , this project The Hope City Devlopment will put him back on top but the over one million bodies buried in Potters Field have other ideas for King and their not very pleasant . It's too bad that almost everyone on Hart Island gets eaten from the inside out by the fly hatching maggots with the person that they were really after Rupert King getting his at the very end . Even though the movie was anything but rational and coherent , especially after some thirty minutes into it , it did for a time hold your interests . The cast also did a much better job then the flimsy material that they were saddled with . There was also the very effective and eerie atmospherics of the spooky Hart Island and Potters field that at times made your flesh crawl . But the plot fell apart with the flies becoming more and more unbelievable as they just seemed to come and go , as if they were out to lunch . Making it possible for those on the island to predict just when it was safe to go outside and eventually escape by boat . One of the most ridicules scenes I've ever seen in a movie is when King is attacked by millions of killer flies and to keep them away from him he blasts away at them with his handgun .

91,"Text1: Updated Faust . You can't help wondering how many times this story has been told in print , on stage , and in film . Weren't there independent redintegrations of this Medieval plot by Marlowe and Goethe ? This version comes to us from Steven Vincent Benet and Archibald MacLeash , updated to the current time . It's entertaining still but all very familiar . Alec Baldwin is a luckless , penniless , sexless unpublished author who just can't catch a break like his college Dan Aykroyd , who has written a highly successful novel , "" A Feeling of Loss . "" All he has are a few fellow sufferers like Barry Miller , who is always willing to tell Baldwin the truth about his writing . An agent , Anthony Hopkins , tells him to write better but Baldwin is going berserk . Back in his shabby apartment he cries out that he'd sell his soul to succeed . Enter Jennifer Love Hewitt as a sexy devil . She gives him the success he pines for . Cabs stop magically to pick him up out of a crowd . An editor , Kim Cattrall , reads his manuscript and decides its worth a first printing of 100 , 000 . That's a lot . You're lucky to get 5 , 000 . But she insists on a few changes . Baldwin agrees , even though the alterations turn his work into the kind of trash that sells . It begins with the title , "" A Loss of Feeling . "" Of course it's a ripoff of Aykroyd's book , "" A Feeling of Loss , "" but that's the point . There follow a number of sequels . "" A Feeling of Greater Loss , "" or something , winding up with "" A Certain Numbness In the Extremities . "" That's pretty funny . Alas , there is a long courtroom scene at the end in which Hopkins defends Baldwin and Hewitt is the prosecutor . The trial is a fantasy . The jury consists of departed writers like Ernest Hemingway and Dorothy Parker . I don't know how this scene was originally written but here it comes across as maundering and uninventive . "" This is the world God gave us , "" Hewitt orates . Smooth violins in the background tell us that this is all very important , in case we didn't get it . I think it's mush . "" Death - - well , death gives us a chance to sum up our lives . "" Baldwin directed this and there's nothing wrong with his work , either as director or actor . Anthony Hopkins is a remarkable actor . He convinces us with such little effort , even when the lines he's forced to read are idiotic . Hewitt is a bit of an embarrassment among the pros . She looks and sounds like a pretty young girl in a high school production . It's hard to pin down just where she goes wrong , but , by contrast , we can check out Kim Cattrall in the part of the shallow and sexy editor . Hewitt looks cute , while Cattrall projects a sleek kind of professionalism . I kind of enjoyed the film except for the last twenty minutes when it bogged down into seriousness . It should have remained the up-tempo screwball comedy that it started out as . Frank Capra would have done wonders with it back in the 30s .


Text2: The Cruel Sea It's hard to dislike the Warner Brothers ' war movies of the 1940s despite any weaknesses they might have had . They are inexpensive , unpretentious , and exciting . And , like most Warner Brothers flicks , they're oriented towards a working-class audience . No fancy philosophizing , no pop psych profundities , no ontological Angst . "" If dis fog gets any thicker we'll have to cut our way through it . "" "" Yeah . A good day to be at home with a blond and a book . "" "" Oh , yeah ? When did you loin to read ? "" "" Who said I could read ? "" "" But you said - - "" ( Dissolve ) There are the usual familiar faces in this one : Bogart , Massey , Alan Hale , Dane Clark , Sam Levene ( great as always ) . Basically , the story is that the crew of an American freighter is torpedoed in mid-Atlantic and their lifeboat is rammed by the submarine . Picked up , they later gather and form the crew of a new Liberty ship , the Sea Witch , and assigned to a large convoy destined for Murmansk , USSR . The convoy is attacked by a Nazi wolfpack and scatters . One submarine follows the Sea Witch and radios its position to the Luftwaffe . Two Nazi planes are sent out to strafe and bomb the ship but both are shot down after causing considerable damage to the ship . The airplanes are curiously antiquated looking . I think the models are supposed to represent Heinkel HE 59s . Finally , the skulking submarine surface to shoot it out with the Sea Witch , fooled into thinking the Liberty ship is mortally wounded by a torpedo . ( Cf . , "" The Enemy Below . "" ) The Sea Witch rams the submarine and sinks her and the German crew dies screaming as water pours in . The men killed at sea are buried with proper ceremony , their names and ranks read off , one by one - - John Murphy , Joe Anderson , Frank Ribetti , Morris Goldberg - - and Bogart after reading the burial service throws in his own two cents worth about how "" it could be any one of us lying there . "" Those Liberty ships , manned by civilian merchant seamen , were really Doozies . The first series was slapped together by Kaiser . It took a few days to build each ship from keel to tiptoptagallant . They were small , unarmed , uncomfortable , and underpowered . They were built in three modules that were then joined , and they had a tendency to come apart at the seams in heavy weather . And the North Atlantic offers what is probably the lousiest weather in the northern hemisphere . The top speed of the ships was about 12 knots . Nicholas Monserrat , in his memoirs , describes being aboard an escort vessel in a convoy and watching the ships beating against a headwind that reduced their flank speed to that of a man walking . Anyway , there is a romance thrown in here so Bogart can be married , but it's short , unobtrusive , and unsentimental . And , as in practically unavoidable in films describing duels between ships and submarines , there is as much suspense as there is action . At times the sea is more of a threat than the enemy is . The action scenes , when they come , are fast , arousing , and a little confusing . As a footnote , the Merchant Marine was not well thought of by the Armed Services because , as civilians , their pay rate was far higher than that of enlisted men . Nevertheless , it was extremely dangerous duty and the percentage of men killed at sea was higher than in any branch of the service . A good example of Warners ' craftsmanship , a simple tale , skillfully done .

92,"Text1: The only movie that makes you laugh at the end of the world . This movie is absolutely brilliant ! It might not be THE best movie ever made but it certainly is one of the most entertaining and fun movies ever made . It isn't even Kubrick's best but it certainly is perhaps his most accessible and entertaining movie . The movie its story and humor are subtle and perfectly makes fun of the whole Cold War situation in the ' 60's . With some subtle dialog Kubrick perfectly makes fun of a very serious and relevant topic . I mean , the story of this movie isn't that unlikely and could had actually really happened . As a matter of fact , it could still happen today . It's frightening but thanks to Kubrick's directing the movie never really becomes serious and remains fun , hilarious and entertaining from beginning till end . It is the only movie that makes you laugh at the end of the world . The actors are also what makes this movie fun to watch . Peter Sellers is nothing short of brilliant in the three different roles that he plays ; Group Captain ( G / C ) Lionel Mandrake / President Merkin Muffley / Dr . Strangelove . But also George C . Scott is comically brilliant in this movie as Gen . ' Buck ' Turgidson and he perhaps plays his very best role . Other actors that stood out were ; Slim Pickens and Peter Bull . This movie also marks James Earl Jones his very first appearance in a movie . This is perhaps the most subtle and ' darkest ' comedies ever made . Everything about it is shear brilliance and even now 40 years later , it hasn't lost any of its power . The movie still looks like it could had been made a couple of months ago . A movie that will never feel outdated or too ' old fashioned ' to watch . In 50 years from now , this movie will be just as good and hilarious , as it is now . Mark my words . The movie is filled with some truly classic long sequences and has countless unforgettable moments and dialog in it . Especially the last sequence , involving Dr Strangelove , is absolutely priceless and unforgettable . Brilliant , brilliant , brilliant !


Text2: The first Hitchcock talkie is a memorable one for different reasons entirely . I have the feeling people call this movie a great one just because it's made by Hitchcock . But truth being told , the movie really isn't among the greatest in its genre . Even the master himself obviously still had some learning to do . No disgrace , since this is the first ' talkie ' from the master of suspense . Well , not exactly entirely a talkie in my book , since the movie is still mostly shot in silent movie style . Sound came available during the making of this movie , which was reason for Hitchcock to re-shoot certain parts of the movie with sound . It doesn't exactly give the movie a very consistent style and makes the editing look clumsy at parts . The movie is a bit of a drag at points , with also some overlong pointless dialog and long shots . The movie does luckily get better when the suspense kicks in and the movie turns into a real thriller . But soon again the movie starts to tend to be overlong at points . It also restrains the movie its story and keeps it rather simplistic . The movie gives you the feeling it had more potential in its story really . There are some great , almost artistic like looking shots within the movie , which still makes this a certainly better than average one and also more interesting to watch . it's a very creatively put together movie , with also some great camera-work , lighting and use of shadows . Of course the museum chase at the end of the movie is the highlight of the movie . It's a greatly directed sequence that is great looking and constructed . It showed Hitchcock's talent and was a premise of things to come . The actors certainly aren't among the greatest of their period . Their excuse could be that this was their first talkie as well though . It's not the most exciting Hitchcock you'll ever see . Even as an early thriller and for 1929 standards it isn't among the most exciting or best ones but it's a movie worth watching for its artistic creativity .

93,"Text1: A Fine Little Film That Is Particularly Important Today ! MY SON THE FANATIC is a small scale film made in 1998 about the problems of cross culture assimilation between Pakistanis and the British - or rather between Muslim and Christian - that packs a powerful punch in the understanding of current clashes similar to the film's story that are so keenly in focus today . Based on a short story by Hanif Kureishi ( who also adapted the story to a screenplay ) and directed by the highly respected Udayan Prasad , this film is blessed with a fine cast of actors who make some of the more improbable aspects quite warmly credible . Parvez ( the always fine Om Puri ) slept through his Muslim education in Pakistan and moved to England with his wife Minoo ( Gopi Desai ) where he has been a taxi cab driver for 25 years while his co-immigrants such as his best friend Fizzy ( Harish Patel ) have become rich entrepreneurs . Parvez and Minoo have a young son Farid ( Akbar Kurtha ) who is a bit unsettled as a Pakistani adjusting to life in capitalistic England and has found a girlfriend Madeline ( Sarah-Jane Potts ) who happens to be the daughter of the Chief Police Inspector Fingerhut ( Geoffrey Bateman ) . Despite the fact that Parvez and his wife would prefer Farid marry a Pakistani girl they consent to an engagement party , a turning point for the politically tenuous Farid . When Farid observes how the Fingerhut family snubs his Pakistani parents and background he explodes and instead joins a fundamentalist Muslim group , pledging his life to stamping out porn , drugs , evil , etc . Parvez attempts reconciliation with his wildly fanatical son but the only person with whom he can communicate is a hooker named Bettina / Sandra ( Rachel Griffiths ) who has a heart of gold and is only in the Profession to make enough money to become a teacher . Parvez is a driver for a pimp service and he is assigned to escort a wealthy smarmy German Schitz ( Stellan Skarsg√•rd ) through a series of encounters , encounters that involve Bettina among others . But along the way Bettina softens to Parvez , listens to his anguish about his son , and eventually becomes Parvez ' paramour . When Farid's fundamentalist group is attacking the brothel where Bettina works he discovers his father's situation and is enraged : Parvez , Farid and Minoo must come to an understanding - and it is this manner of coping that provides a very touching ending to the film . The story holds its own as a movie , but the underlying content is pungent , intelligent , perceptive , insightful and very cogent . Each member of the cast is excellent but Om Puri proves once again that he can carry a film with a questionable character strongly on his shoulders . Not only is this a fine little comedy drama to watch , it also provides some serious food for thought . Grady Harp


Text2: Where does Championship Lie - in the Body or in the Head ? SWIMMING UPSTREAM is a brilliantly acted , deeply involving and ultimately uplifting film from Australia that deserves major audience exposure . Based on a true story of one of Australia's many championship athletes , this story is not merely another biopic ( although it was autobiographically written by Anthony Fingleton , the subject of the film ) : this is a story about large families of poverty , about the tragedies that befall families husbanded by an alcoholic abusive father , and about the ultimate triumph of the individual soul rising out of such conditions . Harold Fingleton ( Geoffrey Rush ) is a drunk , a blue collar worker who has sired five children by a strong but enabling wife Dora ( Judy Davis ) , a man whose focus on sports finds a possible escape from his joblessness when he discovers that his two middle sons Tony ( Jesse Spencer ) and the younger John ( Tim Draxl ) are able swimmers . For reasons unclear Harold focuses on John and while he relentlessly coaches both of the boys at the town pool every day , he decides John is going to be the champion swimmer in Australia . Tony excels in the backstroke and eventually surpasses his beloved brother John's times and proceeds to win the honors Harold expected of John . Throughout this tale of competition in swimming we are privy to the competition within the home . Harold , Jr ( David Hoflin ) is initially the bully yet gradually succumbs to his father's alcoholic lifestyle . Dora is beaten and abused yet is always there for her children , eking out a living and soothing the flare-up tantrums during Harold's drunken states . Tony and John cycle through periods of mutual adulation and the alternative fierce competition into which they are thrown by their father : their evolving bond is unforgettably touching . When Tony at last reaches the peak of his swimming potential , winning medals and applause form his countrymen , he still tries to grasp the love of a father whose is so consumed by his own demons that he is unable to acknowledge Tony's success . Tony's eventual choice of leaving Australia for either the Olympics or for a scholarship to Harvard in the USA provides some of the most touching moments between the various members of this long-suffering family . The direction by Russell Mulcahy is keenly paced , making excellent use of flashbacks to the significant moments in the family's history , and electing to use the split screen technique to underline the tension of the swimming meets while focusing on the faces of the family . As Tony , Jesse Spencer is both wonderful to watch ( he does his own swimming and he is a perfect physical specimen ! ) and reveals acting gifts that are usually those of more seasoned performers . Indeed , Rush , Davis and Draxl also give spellbinding performances that are born of nuance and understatement . In a family where there could be polarization of response from the audience , each of the actors is so fine that we are able to find the complete personas of these disparate people and find warmth and understanding for all of them . One wonders why this film was not heralded in the theatrical release , as it is one of the finer movies to come out in years . Both Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis give outstanding , award deserving performances . The DVD includes all of the ' deleted scenes ' and it is highly recommended to view these important inexplicably cut moments as they truly enhance the film . Very Highly Recommended ! Grady Harp

94,"Text1: Again with the Meaning of Life Thing - - Enough Already "" The Seventh Seal "" would strike me as a better film today had Ingmar Bergman not gone on to remake virtually the same film countless times over the rest of his career . In "" Seal , "" Max von Sydow sits down to a game of chess with the Grim Reaper and seeks answers to the meaning of life , existence of God , and so on and so forth . If you've seen one Bergman film , you've seen them all . The poor man put a lot of effort into exploring life's BIG issues but never seemed to get any closer to an answer about any of them . As I've become a more sophisticated movie watcher , I find Bergman's style nearly intolerable . His films are airless and stifling , and hopelessly pretentious . It's been a long time since I've seen "" The Seventh Seal , "" and maybe I would have a better opinion of it on a second viewing , but frankly , I would rather watch "" Snakes on a Plane "" than watch this film again . One of the famous images in this film is the shot of the Reaper leading a dance of death across a stark hillside . Woody Allen aped it in his 1975 film "" Love and Death . ""


Text2: Pretty to watch but mundane Okay , since the film was made all the way back in 1895 ( when films were in their infancy ) , I'll cut the film some slack . After all , ALL the movies were dull and short pieces about the most mundane activities . And so , compared to contemporary pieces , it's not too bad . The subject matter - - waves crashing - - isn't too interesting , but the film has an artistic composition that make it rather like an Ansel Adams print come to life . Not great , certainly , but for 1895 not bad . If you LOVE this film , then be sure to watch THE ROUGH SEA ( 1900 ) . It must be once of the cinema's first sequels ! Yay ! ! !

DICK FORAN was an amiable Warner player during the ' 30s and ' 40s who spent most of his time as a singing cowboy or playing the romantic lead in a number of trifles as the studio's dependable B-budget star . His real life experience as a band vocalist is used to good effect as a prisoner who gains some respect with a pleasant singing voice , despite an adversarial relationship with chaplain JOHN LITEL ( another stock Warner player ) . Foran does a nice singing and acting job in this otherwise rather ordinary story about a man who has to prove his innocence after being wrongly convicted of murder , thanks to the underhanded work of DICK PURCELL .

Text2: "" My Lord , if it's possible to disregard treason , I offer my sincere regrets . "" I'm probably going about this in reverse direction , this is the first sword wielding epic of Errol Flynn I've been able to watch . As such , I can't make the comparison against the athleticism and youthful enthusiasm of his earlier films as others on this forum have competently done . For me , the adventure played out decently enough , as Flynn's character Jamie Durie needed a cat's nine lives worth of luck to make it through the picture . He always appeared to bounce back after being shot , stabbed , or sworded , and rebounded just as mightily from the travails of his lost loves in the picture . Would that his personal life had gone as smoothly . Roger Livesey's Colonel Burke was the surprise of the movie with his scene stealing manner and discourse . Without the accent he would have made a great sidekick in Flynn's Western films . Following an introduction that might have come to blows , Burke proves to be a loyal accomplice to Durie's schemes , whether escaping from the British or hijacking a pirate ship . Warner Brothers ' Technicolor format holds up quite well today and has that vivid look and feel of early color films , even though some of the renditions look a bit out of place . It reminded me of theater experiences back in the Fifties and early Sixties when most TV shows were still being done in black and white . On the strength of this film , I'm encouraged to seek out Errol Flynn's earlier swashbuckling efforts , most notably "" The Adventures of Robin Hood "" and "" Captain Blood "" . Approaching fifty years since the actor's death , Flynn's personal legacy remains one of the most mysterious and convoluted histories that Hollywood has to offer .

I am reminded of the time that Homer Simpson decides that he will stay home from church and indulge himself in some of life's simple pleasures : drinking beer , walking around in his underwear , smoking cigars and reading Playdude magazine . In this case our intrepid hero is Dan , who sits on the couch drinking beer and playing with his nipple while sniffing his armpit hair as he bemoans the fact that he is on the outs with his girlfriend Lisa .

Text2: A pretty good romantic comedy I have never really liked romantic comedies , I think there's too much crying and sentimental sap . I mostly think of romantic comedies as the kind of movie single women sit down and watch , and cry their eyes out , which is a concept I've never understood . But this movie is definitely one of the better of the genre . I saw it again after having seen it a lot of years ago , and I remembered it as having one single good scene . This is , of course , the famous restaurant scene . But seeing it again , I laughed almost at the very beginning , and kept laughing throughout the next twenty minutes . After that , the hilarity of the characters faded , and it settled by being interesting and capturing . I wanted to know what was going to happen to these characters . Unfortunately , it didn't last , and I lost interest for a few minutes , and then I saw a funny scene again , and regained interest . The same thing happened a few more times , I lost and regained interest with brief pauses . The movie is worth seeing if you like this sort of movie , or if you like debates about male / female friendship . I found the ongoing debate in the movie very interesting and thought-provoking , and most of the movie is pretty funny as well . Some of it is laugh-out-loud funny , and some of it is more like recognize-the-situation funny . If it had kept my interest a little better , I would have given it an 8 , but as it is , I give it .

Now , as for the story , well , it's been transplanted from Valentine Bluffs , Canada , to a town in West Virginia , and the story has been changed around considerably , but the 3D effects will kind of make you forget all that , if you happened to have grown up with the original . Of course , Harry Warden is still the "" boogeyman "" . In this version , Harry has been in the hospital in a coma for years , but he wakes up , takes out most of the hospital staff , and goes back to his home town to open a can of whoop-ass on a bunch of kids partying at a mine .

"" Killer Nun "" is a disappointing Italian nunsploitation film that offers only a little bit of sleaze and nudity . Another serious flaw in the film is the relationship between Sister Gertrude and Sister Mathieu which only hints at lesbianism .

Text2: The long awaited reviewing of a movie I've often trashed I'm only somewhat happy to say that it's nowhere near as bad as I remembered it ? I rated it a dismal after just one viewing . Since I first saw it , probably around a decade ago , I've educated myself in both Westerns and Jarmusch , and I can judge it better being more familiar with its referents . My judgment now : still not very good . To be fair , I can't say that I'm the biggest Jarmusch fan . I've seen most of his movies now , and the only one that works for me on any large level is his most recent , Broken Flowers . That film just blows me away . Other than that , I did like Mystery Train . All of the other films I've seen of his , which include Coffee and Cigarettes , Down by Law , Stranger Than Paradise and Dead Man itself , work for me up to a point . After that point , they just bug me . My specific complaint about Dead Man is that it seems to want to be profound , or at least people think it is ( the lead comment on IMDb right now begins : "" A profoundly spiritual film speaking to our true human nature in a world of illusion "" ) , but it also wants to be a goofy / weird comedy . That goofiness is fun at times , but definitely kills any apparent profundity . And , dammit , how can anyone take it the least bit seriously with that damn fat Indian ? I hate the character of Nobody , and hate Gary Farmer's performance . If it weren't for him , I think I'd like the film . I like a lot about it . First and foremost , the cinematography is outstanding . I also love the quirky costume design . And the supporting performances are fun . I personally don't think Jarmusch is trying to be profound at all . I think the goofiness was more of his intention . In that case , it would have been better if it had been trimmed a bit . This is his longest film , I think , and , even besides Nobody , it overstays its welcome . While I don't hate it anymore , this is certainly my least favorite of Jarmusch's films .

We also follow Nick , who is trapped in a hospital with a weird , intimidating staff , and nervous , frightened patients who are reluctant to answer his probing questions about the mysterious behavior of those in charge of their well being . I'm in the minority regarding this movie , because I thought it was an unsettling , rather creepy little demonic thriller , with terrific make-up effects from Robert Hall and his Almost Human team . I thought the demons were genuinely frightening , and provide a real sense of dread as Amy confronts opposing forces who want her soul . The Rosemary's Hospital is quite a spooky setting and it's back story heightens the terror , while also providing answers to what Amy is up against . . a battle , or test , facing a past decision regarding her father's death that has lingered over the years , and overcoming this by confronting it will be the only way of escaping those who desire for her to "" join them . "" The theme is really traditional "" good vs evil "" subject matter with Amy's soul hanging in the balance . Renowned camera operator Raymond Stella learned a lot from working with Dean Cundy , as cinematographer really creating a disquieting atmosphere within the hospital ( . . the way the lights flicker on and off ; how disconcerting , empty , and dark the halls are ) . Within the film , Amy does have help ( . . ambiguously presented by certain characters who somehow know her name , like the taxi driver ) in discovering the history of Rosemary's hospital in pursuit of saving Nick , while the evil forces always try to thwart her mission . Nick also finds himself pitted against the forces of darkness , trying to uncover the mystery behind the hospital he's stuck in , while also attempting to understand the aggressive and off-putting nature of the staff . Why do they take so much blood , and where are they when he needs them ? Director Michael Hurst creates a state of unease for Amy and from the moment she leaves the wreck , the film remains surreal and strange , a world in purgatory as she attempts to find Nick , a spiritual struggle to the very end . Flashy role for Ellie Cornell ( Halloween IV ) as a disgruntled , acid-tongued white trash mother of Melissa who doesn't appreciate Amy's attempts at "" headshrinking "" her daughter . Kane Hodder has a terrific cameo as a bum who attempts to attack Amy , and gets into a violent scuffle with Lucas . O'Connel , as Lucas , is able to create an air of mystery despite conveying a very comforting and supportive friend to Amy , who certainly needs one . The climax in the hospital is a doozy , particularly when Amy must face the spirits of burn victims and killer nurses after her as she searches for Nick . The computer effects aren't as effective as the make-up prosthetic work , but I felt they aren't a really heavy burden on the movie overall . Cool factoid","{""output"": ""NO""}"
104,"Text1: A lot better than I assumed it would be . . . . in fact , it's very , very good For years I avoided watching this film whenever it came on television . This was mostly due to my thinking that because it was the movie about a nun and marine trying to survive on a tropical island together during WWII so I assumed it would be filled with clich√©s and sappy dialog . I really expected it to be like the merging of THE SINGING NUN with FATHER GOOSE as well as a standard war film ! However , after watching the film , I am very happy to report that the film was very intelligently written - - and not at all what I had expected . It's one of the best films either of the leads ( Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr ) made . The film begins with Mitchum being washed up on shore on a tiny Pacific island in 1944 . The island is deserted except for a nun ( Kerr ) and although there is plenty to eat and drink on the island , they are worried that no one will ever find them , so they plan on taking a big risk and sailing 300-odd miles to civilization . However , there plans are changed when the island is bombed and then occupied by the Japanese . Much of the film was spent in hiding until a very exciting and nerve-racking conclusion . The film wasn't the least bit preachy or silly , but dealt with the relationship between Kerr and Mitchum as well as the delicate subject of burgeoning sexual attraction between them . The way this was handled should neither offend anyone's religious sensibilities nor bore them with heavy-handed platitudes - - a tough job for such a film but it managed to handle it very well . This made for a very interesting and realistic film - - one of the better war films because it was so different and because of the excellent performances .


Text2: Perfect , dumb entertainment ! No one really wanted , or asked for , a sequel to the seriously stupid 1997 creature feature Anaconda . But it was a hit ( somehow ) and you know how studios are when it comes to milking something for all it's worth - yes , Halloween 9 is currently in pre-production ! Surprisingly , Anacondas is actually quite good for what it is . Originally meant to be a direct-to-video production , Sony was so impressed with the dailies that they more than doubled the budget and elevated it to a theatrical release . The budget constraints still cramp its style , compared to A-list studio stuff , but it's the best film it possibly can be . With a touch more plot , involving a search for an ultra-mega-massively rare flower , called the Blood Orchid , that only blooms every seven years and can unlock the secret to everlasting life , there is a sophistication to the script , rather than plain old slither'n'slash . So we have a bunch of scientists on an expedition to the unknown depths of the Borneo jungle and it's not off to a good start . They can only afford a ramshackle boat ; it's the rainy season and the rivers are mighty treacherous . Also , their boat captain ( Johnny Messner ) is a gruff ex-Special Forces American , with the cutest pet monkey ever . Everyone seems to be okay about their perilous quest until they are attacked by big crocs , go over a waterfall and become shipwrecked . Then , when things can't get any worse , one of them is gobbled up by - you've guessed it - an anaconda . Instead of the traditional one-by-one deaths story , like the first film , there is more conflict and interaction . These characters may not be the best , or the most well written , but the actors do what they can with what they've been given . Messner is especially good , keeping a cool head as snakes prey upon them from every shadow . J-Low-IQ , the hammy John Voight and Ice Cube may be gone ( there is a quick reference to them ) , but fellow Boyz N The Hood alumni Morris Chestnut and E . R . star Salli Richardson are offered up as potential reptile food . And it just so happens that it's mating season . And the snakes are all up for a big orgy . And guess where the Blood Orchids are ? Right above their shagging pit . Oh bloody hell ! Luis Llosa made Anaconda in the most simplistic and static way possible . This time Dwight H . Little , the very man who gave us Halloween 4 , the epic Steven Seagal movie Marked For Death and err . . . Free Willy 2 , brings strong direction and integrity . It's a darker , more complex film that seriously promises to deliver the goods , but comes up a bit short . If it had been taken a few steps further , then it would have been great . As it is , it's more atmospheric and professional , but still , a bleaker ending , with more gobbled-up characters , would have suited me better . The snakes themselves look okay , nothing special . Little keeps them hidden for as long as possible , only offering brief glimpses here and there . A snake is an awkward looking villain , so keeping it hidden is probably wiser . There is also , thank heavens , no dodgy animatronics . Incredibly dumb and unnecessary it may be , but Anacondas is easy , inoffensive entertainment that will surely appeal to some part of everybody's taste .

Alone in the Dark features one of the better casts assembled for what is essentially a slasher movie .

Potter , his wife , and the police ) to the discovery that a child molester has been in the house and spent the afternoon with the Potter's daughter . The reaction ? no big deal . Go on with things as normal . - That 80's Feeling . I hate the term "" dated "" when describing a movie , but it's the best I can come up with to describe Dr . Potter's sister .

106,"Text1: classic entertainment The last time I saw this movie was probably the late ' 60s , when I watched it on television with a group of friends . I just saw it again on DVD , and it's as much fun as I remember it . In 108 minutes , I wouldn't be surprised if 90 minutes was music , and what music ! One Irving Berlin song after another , sung by either Alice Faye , Don Ameche , Ethel Merman , or Jack Haley . A young Merman , with a sexy figure , really pops in this film with her exciting belt voice . A thinnish plot surrounds the songs . It's the story of a classical musician ( Tyrone Power ) who forms a swing band and , because of the song "" Alexander's Ragtime Band "" takes the name Alexander for himself and the Ragtime Band for his group . The movie takes us loving , losing , and playing music through World War I and into the swing era , though there's not a gray hair to be found among our heroes . Ameche and Power were friends before either one of them was signed by 20th Century Fox , and with Faye , they made "" In Old Chicago "" together plus this film - and both Faye / Ameche and Faye / Power made other films together as well . The three work very well as an ensemble . Faye is especially lovely in this . She sings in a commanding contralto , wears some great fashions , and is appropriately feisty , low-class , or classy as the part demands . As lovely as she was , though , she's no competition for the most gorgeous one in the movie , Tyrone Power . He's pretty darn breathtaking in that tuxedo of his . He could have conducted me anywhere . Monumentally entertaining music and plenty of eye candy - highly recommended .

Since she resides in France and hasn't made many , if any , English-speaking films , we here in North America haven't really seen her since this film . Assante and Antonio Bandaras are the two leads , however , sharing the spotlight with the music . Both actors are excellent , maybe the best roles of their careers .

As the rain continues to fall , he gets the history of the place from "" crazy drunk "" , and seemingly the only normal person in the village , Ezequiel ( Francisco Rabal , who is great ) and discovers not only the incredible secrets of the locals , but the truth about himself . Stuart Gordon once again delivers decent B level horror taking its title from a very brief H . P . Lovecraft short story , but being based more closely on another tale titled "" The Shadow Over Innsmouth "" . The result is a nicely done tale with heavy atmosphere . Production design / art direction and cinematography are excellent ; this is definitely a film with good visuals . The music is quite suitably ominous and the film just builds in intensity as it goes along . It has quite a good feeling of mystery and a heavy accent on mythology and the ultimate revelations are interesting , to say the least . I haven't seen anything quite like "" Dagon "" , which is definitely a good thing . Godden makes for an enjoyable lead in the sense that he's not quite a conventional variety of hero . He's nerdy , jittery , and not really all that likable , but it's easy to share his befuddlement at his situation . Rabal is quite delightful as provider of some of the exposition ( this was one of his final roles , and the film is dedicated to him ) , and Macarena Gomez is lovely and bewitching as the character of Uxia . The effects are a decent combination of traditional makeup and CGI , and the film has a solidly grim and nasty tone that gives it an extra bit of kick . It's good and engaging outrageousness ; with the help of his old cohorts , producer Brian Yuzna and screenwriter Dennis Paoli , Gordon adds another fine H . P . Lovecraft adaptation to his filmography . Godden and Gordon , of course , would go on to work on another Lovecraft adaptation , the ' Masters of Horror ' entry ' Dreams in the Witch-House ' .


Text2: An enjoyable work of subtly sinister Gothic horror . At the turn of the century , Dr . Paul Eswai ( Giacomo Rossi-Stuart ) is called upon to conduct an autopsy on a girl who has died under suspicious circumstances . He arrives to find a bunch of cagey and frightened villagers who fear the curse that they have to live with . As part of my intent to broaden my horizons and explore more foreign horror , I watched this nice little horror film from Mario Bava , perhaps the greatest master of Italian horror of all time , based on recommendations here , and the film does not disappoint . A very rich film to look at , it evokes its era very well , with wonderful sets and photography . Bava infuses it with a healthy amount of atmosphere ; many outdoor scenes include a healthy amount of fog , and the indoor sets have portions completely covered in cobwebs . The sense of impending doom is strong ; the thought of what secrets might be revealed helps to keep the film engrossing . It's made all the more effective by a moody and ominous music score . Finally , the film does wonders to make the sound of a little girls ' giggle disturbing rather than appealing . Rossi-Stuart isn't bad in the lead , but it's the lovely ladies in the supporting roles that really command attention , particularly the incredibly alluring brunette Fabienne Dali as Ruth , the sorceress . I also liked Piero Lulli as the Inspector , and Luciano Catenacci ( a . k . a . Max Lawrence ) as the burgomeister . Any fan of period horror pieces would be advised to check out this entertaining entry ; it can easily rival anything made by Britain's Hammer studios . Short and economical ( even working with a low budget Bava really gets the job done ) , it gets right down to business and moves at a respectable pace . I definitely enjoyed it . Bavas ' son Lamberto ( later director of the 1980's gore favorite "" Demons "" ) was assistant director here .

High Spirits is set in Ireland where Peter Plunkett ( Peter O'Toole ) is told he has two weeks left to pay the mortgage on his ancestral Castle turned hotel , unfortunately the hotel isn't very popular & in an attempt to muster business Peter advertises it as an authentic haunted Castle complete with real ghosts . Peter's attempt's at fooling his guests into thinking the Castle is haunted fail miserably , however all is not lost as then the real ghosts take over . Much hilarity ensues , not . . . This English American co-production was written & directed by Neil Jordan & quite frankly I think High Spirits is a pretty bad film . The script is a muddled mess , there are sporadic moments of supposed comedy , there's an awful romance between American tourist Steve Guttenberg & ghost Daryl Hannah , there's stupid drama & it tries to chuck some horror into the mix as well . None of it works , it never comes together as one coherent piece & the fact that it's so unfunny , childish , predictable & rather boring doesn't help my love for it . The character's are clich√©d , the ghosts are underused & did I mention that it wasn't funny yet ? So here we have a film that tries to be a horror comedy but fails on both counts , High Spirits is not a film I look back on with any fondness . At all . Director Jordan has apparently gone on record as saying that he had no input over the editing process & what was released was substantially different to his original cut , to be honest that sounds like an excuse for making such a bad film as he still directed the scenes which ended up on screen , it was still his script this mess came from & quite frankly how much difference could there have been ? Was there hours of unused footage ? Would any of it been any funnier if there was ? I imagine the studio probably tweaked it a bit but maybe because Jordan's original cut was even worse , I just don't believe this ' it would have been brilliant if the studio had left it alone ' rubbish . , anyway I guess we'll never find out either way . . . I must admit the film looks quite nice with good sets although the special effects vary between impressive & poor . On a side note did anyone else notice the white horse Guttenberg lands in front of when he falls out of the tree hit by lightening ( don't ask ) ? I'm positive you can see the horse's penis dangling between it's legs , not that I specifically look out for these things you understand . . . Technically High Spirits is fine with decent production values . Looking at the cast list it's pretty impressive although no one covers themselves in glory , O'Toole is good but that's it . Gutteneberg tries to act all emotional , oh dear . . . High Spirits is a comedy that simply isn't funny & it's story is a mess that doesn't entertain , I don't know what else to say other than I didn't like it . Could have been better , much better . Watch Ghostbusters ( 1984 ) instead to see how a proper supernatural comedy should be done .

Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle ( Kristin Erickson ) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood . Her parents Ely ( Randy Colton ) & Blanche ( Leslie Fleming-Mitchell ) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter , recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's . Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel ( Del Zamora ) recognises Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it . Blanche calls priest Jacob ( Cameron Daddo ) who is her other daughter Claire's ( Madison Taylor ) ex husband to see Isabelle , he confirms Miguel's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle & an innocent girl free . . . Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over & over again , why do I do it . Why do I keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder ? Right lets honest about this , Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of The Exorcist ( 1973 ) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share . There's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things , the demon that uses past misdemeanour's against other's , the worried parents , the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's , the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things . I suppose where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different ( other than it's total crap ) is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring . The film starts with Isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either , the rest of the character's are poorly written & fleshed out . At times I wondered whether Blackwater Valley exorcism was a spoof , there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a ' little prick ' he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back ! There are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect . The film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama , or it did in my opinion at least . According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on ' Actual Events ' , yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called The Exorcist . . . This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest . There isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up , there's a scene of a cut arm , there's a dead dog , someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that's about it . There's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive . I would imagine the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast's are seen . One pair of naked female breast's is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it . There is zero scares , no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 000 , 000 I must say that I am wondering where all the money went , the film looks ugly & cheap throughout . There are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom .

Text2: REPO MAN ( Alex Cox , 1984 ) This is a cult sci-fi comedy that is highly regarded in some circles but one which I never had the opportunity to watch before now ; as usual with such ' modern classic ' fare for me , while I liked it well enough , its uneven tone and general bleakness cause it to fall short of its reputation . A punk kid is reluctantly roped in as a Repo Man , a renegade band of people who repossess unpaid-for cars ; their workforce includes world-weary Harry Dean Stanton , secretary Vonetta McGee and philosophical caretaker Tracey Walter . While there's an admittedly witty script replete with four-letter words , we also get some gratuitous grossness ? such as having Emilio Estevez vomiting ( for no good reason ) after a chase on foot ! Typical of writer-director Cox , the soundtrack is full of rock / punk songs ; appropriately , his next film ? SID AND NANCY ( 1986 ) ? would be a biopic of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his notorious girlfriend Nancy Spungen , which I might just acquire anyway now . The sci-fi elements involve an unseen ' alien ' locked inside the trunk of a car which is chased through the streets of L .

We watch as the Predalien spreads eggs into the human populace while the face-huggers , which escapes the crashed Predator ship , attach to human faces . The birthing process , unlike in previous Alien films , is much faster it seems and they soon grow into the monsters that go on a murderous rampage leaving bodies piled up . Soon the National Guard moves in only to be eliminated in quick fashion , leaving a motley group of surviving citizens to fend for their very lives as menacing baddies are at every turn . A Predator warrior , who finds his fallen comrades , silently vows vengeance , and any human in this path will die . Glossy dumb cartoon action-horror flick is a fun way to waste 100 minutes . Characters are given just enough exposition to establish them before they face the trials of being in between a war of a Predator warrior and slimy alien walkers . Yes , a lot of the film takes place at night and within darkened places ( such as a sewer during which alien face huggers attach themselves to derelicts ' faces and Predalien attacks a female hobo who finds her buddies under unfortunate conditions , while we also see the Predator warrior setting up hi-tech booby-traps and blasting them before exploding through the city street above ) so the action can be hard to place which is a shame . I didn't have a problem others , it seems , have with the CGI used in the film . CGI actually never occurred to me .

The Predalien is a funny hybrid which can actually lay eggs down the throats of victims ( . . as is the case when the things fills the body of a pregnant woman in a hospital ) . It has the face of a Predator , yet has the alien walker's whipping tail . As in any of the previous films that came before this , there are human casualties , in the wrong place at the wrong time , such as a father and his son hunting , nuclear power plant technicians who find themselves trapped at work while the Predator warrior does battle with an alien walker , a sensitive father whose killed right in front of his returned soldier wife and frightened daughter , etc . You have two brothers , with a troubled relationship , who must set aside their differences when terrors are threatening them . One's hottie girlfriend gets the goofy clich√©d lines that have become standard dialogs for these kind of films , such as "" We're not gonna make it , are we ? "" or "" Maybe , they're all gone . "" You have the typical governmental corruption , as humans expect an airlift to rescue them with a plane under different orders .

Oldman and Considine are great in their respective roles and they are the real reason why i wanted to see this film so bad , it looked god , looked like Oldman was going a bit retro again and so on . but the story is dull and the dialogue is flat throughout , and Ledoyen , who i found to be so effervescent in ' the beach ' looks as if she is on a downer in this , i mean there's relationship problems , but she really was dull in this . the film takes a sadistic turn after two of the locals decide to re-enact straw Dogs , and it all goes a bit messy toward the end . still , if you like the two leads , and love to hear Oldman swear with his great accent , then this is for you .

112,"Text1: The imaginary world of children Sir Laurence Olivier , Carol Lynley , Keir Dullea and Noel Coward star in "" Bunny Lake is Missing , "" a 1965 black and white British film directed by Otto Preminger . A young woman , Ann Lake ( Lynley ) and her brother Steven ( Dullea ) report the woman's little girl , nicknamed Bunny , missing when she can't be found at her school on her first day of class . The detective in charge , Supt . Newhouse ( Olivier ) soon finds out that Bunny's things are disappearing from the new apartment where she , her mother and uncle live , and Newhouse begins to wonder if Bunny ever existed at all . This is a dark , atmospheric film that takes the viewer into an adult world where a child's fantasy life is explored and often accepted - the cofounder of the school on its top floor listening to children's dreams on tape as she writes a book about children's fantasies ; the man who runs the doll hospital ; and Ann herself , who had an imaginary friend as a child called Bunny , named after a character in a book . Is Bunny Lake missing ? Was there ever a Bunny Lake ? Is Steven trying to cover for his sister ? "" Bunny Lake is Missing "" is very offbeat and will make you uneasy as you , along with Newhouse , try to figure out what's going on . The acting is very good - Olivier obviously did this role for money - there is nothing particularly interesting about it , though he does a good job . The pretty Lynley gives an ambiguous performance - she's either a grieving mother , a nut , or both , and Dullea is equally ambiguous - does he know more than he says he does ? Is he placating his sister ? Noel Coward has a showy if small role as the Lake's landlord , a rather strange bird into S & M who proudly shows one of the detectives the skull of the Marquis de Sade . Though not entirely satisfying , this is a great movie to see on a Sunday afternoon . It takes you right into the darkness of London and leaves you there as it travels through a child's strange world and comes out in illusion ? Reality ? Or madness ?


Text2: Beautiful film that shows the essence of a true hero Gary Cooper is Lou Gehrig in "" The Pride of the Yankees , "" a 1942 film also starring Teresa Wright , Babe Ruth , Walter Brennan and Dan Duryea . The film chronicles Gehrig's life growing up as a German-American . As a young boy , his mother wanted him to become an engineer . Instead , he becomes a world-famous ballplayer , marries , and lives a charmed life until he is struck down by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , ALS , which today is still called "" Lou Gehrig's disease . "" ALS leads to a progressive atrophy of the voluntary muscles until sufferers can no longer walk , speak , eat or even breathe . Its cause is as unknown today as it was in Gehrig's time . Yet in his farewell speech at Yankee Stadium , Lou Gehrig said he considered himself the luckiest man on earth . By all accounts , Lou Gehrig was a prince of a man , an honest , caring gentleman , and Gary Cooper portrays him that way . Cooper , who had a smile that could light up the world , is boyish , quiet , and shy as Gehrig , which makes what happened to him particularly devastating . That's the way it was in real life , too . Teresa Wright as Eleanor is excellent , as is Walter Brennan , Elsa Janssen and Ludwig Stossel . Janssen portrays Gehrig's mother , a tough woman who tries to steamroller over Eleanor - in real life , the two women never got along , though the film shows some sort of reconciliation . Babe Ruth as Babe Ruth is a standout , giving a very relaxed and energetic performance in his colleague's story . The film is criticized by Gehrig aficionados for taking dramatic license with the facts of Gehrig's life . Though this is hard to take if you know a subject well , it's always done in films . The main controversy is over Gehrig's famous speech , which was shortened and changed . The "" luckiest "" part was moved to the end of the speech , for one thing , probably to make a strong end to the film . One nice , accurate touch - the bracelet Lou gives to Eleanor is the actual bracelet that Mrs . Gehrig received from her husband , and she lent it to the film . Despite criticisms , the film gives us the essence of Lou Gehrig , in large part thanks to the script by Paul Gallico ( the Brennan character ) , the direction by Sam Wood , and the performance of Gary Cooper . Cooper was too old to play a college kid - but the essence is there . And what an incredible-looking man - I don't care what age he's playing . He was no good at playing baseball and had to be coached to get even the basics , but probably only an expert could tell that . You'll be good and choked up by the end . ALS continues to kill today and took the lives of such people as David Niven , Dennis Day , Mao Tse-Tung and others . The depiction of the onset of symptoms in "" Pride of the Yankees "" is accurate . For it to strike such a fine man and great athlete is heartbreaking .

When the ' all ' is a person you are on even more dangerous ground because you have implied full disclosure of private life and public career . In this case Michel Ciment either with or without guidance from director Luc Beraud makes no mention of such Mank films as No Way Out , The Late George Apley , Escape , The Honey Pot etc and most of those mentioned receive little more than the equivalent of station identification . For a moment I thought Ciment was even going to let Mank off the notorious rewriting Scott Fitzgerald episode on Three Comrades but even when he does bring it up he accepts at face value Mank's explanation that the novel and the screenplay require totally different disciplines followed by his assertion that Fitzgerald's screenplay was unfilmable with no evidence to back it up . This is at odds with Budd Schulberg's account - in his roman a clef The Disenchanted - of how Fitzgerald winged a very visual sequence involving a skier and an automobile at a story conference . It's true there are some tasty anecdotes - especially if you haven't heard them before - and for those who know of Mank but not too much about him it will fill in some gaps but more than that . . .

In some of the scenes Whitaker mouths the words as if he is being forced to . The person who made him up for this difficult part does deserve praise . A young Scottish man , just graduated from the University as a doctor , goes to Uganda and in a chance meeting , he comes across the new dictator Amin . The latter has just overthrown the unjust Obote , and in a general compassionate speech , he promises the citizens of Uganda the world . Everyone cheers but the ruthlessness of Amin soon begins to show . He takes his young doctor under his charge and at first the man is doing everything but doctoring . He even steps in for the Ugandan dictator at an important meeting . When our doctor sees what's going on , he tries to escape , but it's too late . He is severely brutalized and it is amazing that he survived . He is fixed up by a doctor who shall soon receive a bullet in his head for his efforts . Our young hero manages to get on a plane that has been reserved for the hostages take to Uganda by Amin's Palestinian friends . By the way , the film never showed the Israelis saving all but one of Israel's hostages . A lot of this film is almost reading like a soap opera .

Text2: Amusement A maniac practical joker , with an overexaggerated , distinctively crazed laugh , terrorizes three young female adults he knew from childhood . We witness how he sets them up before capturing each one of them , preparing a very grisly game holding them in his house of horrors , a maze of intricately designed traps in darkened rooms he elaborately created for them to fall prey to for his own amusement . The opening hour works as a loose anthology , with each female victim headlining a chapter in the movie , named after them . The first victim is Shelby ( Laura Breckenridge ) , who is riding home with her boyfriend , Robert ( Tad Hilgenbrink ) who likes to drive within a convoy ( . . partnered with two other vehicles on an interstate , working as a team ; this one has a suspicious trucker in a rig and a seemingly hospitable suburban father driving an SUV ) . Unfortunately , Robert chooses the wrong convoy , it containing the laughing psychopath whose goal is to kidnap Shelby . This one is woefully short in length and ends rather abruptly with the true psycho pulling a fast one on Robert . The second tale concerns Tabitha ( Katherine Winnick ) , babysitting her nephews while the parents are away . This one works off the fear of clowns and builds suspense ( . . a slow burner where Tabby's sleeping room is decorated in clown dolls with a particular big one in a chair giving her the willies ) eclipsing the first tale , which had ended as it was just getting good . Someone is in the house with Tabitha , the laughing psycho who dons an eerie disguise ( . . the clown mask is particularly effective ) chasing after her . . reminiscent of Halloween , Tabitha must get the boys out of the house as the maniac attempts to break into the bedroom . The third tale , a bit long-in-the-tooth , concerns Lisa ( Jessica Lucas ) who is worried about a roommate / pal who hasn't returned to their pad , very uncharacteristic for such a "" good girl "" . Persuading her beau , Dan ( Reid Scott ) to drive her to the residence where the friend claimed to be heading , Lisa makes an unfortunate discovery . . a certain someone is waiting just for her . This tale follows Lisa within the ominous confines of a decadent hotel which harbours an unpleasant truth regarding past visitors who became victims of a certain cackling madman . The remainder of the film follows Tabitha as she makes her way through a darkened hellhole , created by the weirdo , not as familiar with this foul unfriendly environment as he is , finding her friends Shelby and Lisa in a very difficult position . Kind of a Saw-lite , with traps and psychological warfare befalling the three female leads and those who happen to be around them , in the wrong place at the wrong time . I thought it was technically sound . . I was thoroughly impressed with the cinematography from Mark Garret and the art direction of Bence Erdelyi & Mih√°ly Moln√°r . While I wasn't that blown away by the content of the movie ( . . rather bland and predictable story-line , even as the filmmakers attempted a clever arrangement of chapters leading up to the "" great escape "" where the girls try to flee their captor whose hot on their trail ) , it looks great and is professionally made . Being that this is an independent horror film , it looks as if is has the production values of a big Hollywood budget . I attribute this to the presentation . . I just wish the material present had some originality and pizazz to it . The attractive leads I found credible enough , although I found Keir O'Donnell as the hissable villain really terrible in his over-the-top performance , never creepy enough and , without restraint , he just reeks of amateurishness . I think the overall film is uneven , certain chapters ( Shelby & Lisa ) suffering pacing issues . . . the first too short , the third too long . A problem plaguing me was how Tabitha found herself in the killer's lair towards the end . . and how the psychiatrist winds up there also left me scratching my head .

This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney would star in . Cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing . And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it . He plays the role with a lot of confidence . He apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time , so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career . He obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in . The movie is directed by Lloyd Bacon , who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre . His earliest ' 30's musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as "" 42nd Street "" . His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really . ' 30's musicals never were really about its singing , this was something that more featured in ' 40's and later made musicals , mainly from the MGM studios . As usual it has a light and simple story , set in the musical world , that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way . It nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch . So do the characters and actors that are portraying them . Sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie , when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines . The musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done , even though I'm not a too big fan of the genre itself .

Text2: A terrible mess . Dear oh dear . . . I liked the first 2 Blade movies very much and thought they were perfect horror / action entertainment , so I kind of expected the same thing from "" Blade : Trinity "" . The movie however turned out to be a terrible mess with an incredibly awfully told story and sidekicks that became more interesting and better than Blade himself . You know something is terribly wrong when you're care way more and are more interested in the sidekicks than in the main title character . Man to blame is director David S . Goyer . This guy is no director , let him stick to produce and writing movies . He tells the movie its story in such an incredibly messy and uninteresting way that I kept losing track , not because the story was that complicated but because it was told in such a completely messy way . The movie felt terribly incoherent like none of the scene's were really connected with each other . Also the fight scene's that were perhaps the best elements of the previous two Blade movies were disappointing in this third Blade entry . They were filmed with little flair and the terrible editing made it impossible to tell at times what was exactly happening on the screen . Yes , this movie features the worst editing I have seen in a while but that is what happens when you have three editors on the job . The new characters Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler ( really , did she had to be Whistler's daughter ? That served absolutely no purpose and was nothing more than just a lame , pointless story addition . ) are cool and interesting . At least more interesting than Blade ! They add a lot of humor and style to the movie and they are about the two only successful things about this movie . OK The cinematography by Gabriel Beristain might be a third successful thing about the movie but it ends right after there really . The villains are also a disappointing element of the movie . I mean √ºber-vampire Dracula is in this , you would expect something more from a character like that but he has got very little to do and its unclear what exactly his motivations are and what he is trying to achieve . I feel that "" Blade : Trinity "" still could had been a good movie , with a different , better and more experienced director at the helm . Couldn't they just had waited until director Guillermo Del Toro became available again ? This movie makes a terrible messy impression and feels like a lame excuse to quickly cash in some more money after the more successful and better previous two Blade movies . I didn't expected this to be so but this was the worst movie I have seen , in the last couple of months .

122,"Text1: Not Lewton's best film , but a good exhibition of eerie atmosphere The Ghost Ship was put together because RKO pictures wanted another film to be made using the existing sets from their earlier film , Pacific Liner . This shows somewhat , as the film has something of a rushed and unfinished feel to it ; but there's nobody better than Val Lewton for the task of putting together an eerie thriller , and considering the reasons why this was made ; he hasn't done a bad job at all . The film isn't up there with his best work - films such as Cat People , I Walked With a Zombie and The Body Snatcher - but I still rate this as a successful production credit for the man , and as an eerie sea bound thriller ; it definitely works . The plot is simple ( probably as a result of the reason that the film was made ) and it follows a ship whose third mate suspects that the captain may be the one murdering the crew , some members of which have been dying under mysterious circumstances . We then follow a familiar psychological drama formula , which is fleshed out by some set pieces typical of Lewton's films . The atmosphere , as usual with Lewton , is right on cue and makes up the backbone of the movie . The smoky setting compliments the isolation of being at sea nicely , and the film always seems interesting and foreboding for this reason . The story is weak and somewhat dull for the first half hour of the movie - and this is somewhat due to the lack in atmosphere . The first half does treat us to the film's best set-piece - a man being crushed by a huge chain ( no less ! ) - but you'll have to wait until the second half before the movie really picks up . As you would expect from Lewton , the film is never gratuitous , but during the second half the story starts to pick up , and as the tension mounts , director Mark Robson allows the film to reach it's climatic conclusion . Mark Robson isn't the best director that Lewton worked with - and all of his movies have been lesser entries in the great producer's list of film credits , but he knows what he's doing and this is another decent film from him . On the whole - you'll probably want to see the Jacques Tourneur collaborations , along with The Body Snatcher first - but after you've seen those , this is a good place to go next .


Text2: Entertaining Vincent Price ' haunted house ' movie This film is a lot better than you might expect . It follows the story of a wayward million dollars that is believed to be hidden within the walls of an old house . The inhabitants of the house are a female writer and her crew of servants . . . . oh , and a prowler known as ' the bat ' , who evidently wants the fortune for himself . The Bat is notable for a great macabre atmosphere that creates a sense of claustrophobia , as the house is in the middle of nowhere . It's also notable for an early performance from Vincent Price , who appears as the doctor , Malcolm Wells . Price was better known in 1959 for the William Castle classic "" House on Haunted Hill "" , but ' The Bat ' is still an able entry in his list of acting credits . Price evidently grew as an actor throughout the 60's and 70's , but his early performances always have that x-factor that would go on to instill the man in the hearts of horror fans forever , and his performance here has that also . The story itself has lots of room for tension and intrigue , and it makes best use of it as the film is constantly intriguing , and many scenes , particularly the ones involving the menacing bad guy , are filled with suspense . The film is at it's best when ' the bat ' is on the prowl , and features several lovely shots of the fiend poking his arm through various crevices in the house . The house itself is riddled with various traps and secret passages in true haunted house style , and it adds to the inventiveness and effectiveness of the movie . The film gives the twist away far too early , however , and it kind of spoils the ending as it turns out that , logically , there's only one person who the bat could possibly be . It doesn't really matter though , as the film is always a lot of fun and if you're a fan of Vincent Price ( and who isn't ? ! ) , or just classic horror movies in general , I highly recommend this movie .

It would be flippant to criticise something that was produced solely for MTV addicts so I won't mention that Rob Cohen's direction is just a feature length music video where the chicks are too fit to be true or that when someone walks around they do so in sexy slo mo , or that the soundtrack is intrusive , or that the cars are too fast to be realistic or that the multi ethnic problems of street culture are ignored . In fact that is a valid criticism as the bloods , crips , underclass and middle class students all get together and no one seems to have a culture issue . Vin Diesel is another valid criticism . Am I alone in thinking that he's the only leading man in film history who rivals Steven Segal as most unconvincing actor ever ? Oh and I have never ever seen so much product placement in my life . Aren't there any laws against this sort of thing ? By a very strange irony I have a FAST AND FURIOUS T-shirt . Ironic in the sense that I wore an item of clothing for a film whose existance only seems to involve advertising products

124,"Text1: A Last Ditch Effort Taking a look at the screen credits of Ruby Keeler and you'll find that Go Into Your Dance is not only the only film she did with her husband Al Jolson , but after five films , her first away from Dick Powell . She did two more subsequent to Go Into Your Dance with Powell , but after only one more film at Warner Brothers , she only made three more prior to retiring from the screen and settling down as wife and mother . Of course Keeler did make a comeback in the Sixties and I well remember seeing her and Patsy Kelly in that Broadway revival of No No Nanette . What Go Into Your Dance really was meant to do is try to save the Jolsons marriage which was in free fall by then . Al's egomania didn't make him the easiest person to live with and within a few years Keeler called it quits . For the rest of her life she would never answer one question about life with Jolson . Warner Brothers did assemble a good cast for them . Al plays an irresponsible , egomaniacal entertainer , no stretch in the casting department . He's walked out on too many a show as his sister Glenda Farrell tells him , no producer will hire him . Never mind says Jolie , he'll produce his own with a new dancer he's discovered , Ruby Keeler . Producing costs money and that means going to gangster Barton MacLane whose trampy wife wants to resume her show business career . Jolie gets the money and the wife played by Helen Morgan . But his problems are only beginning . Bobby Connolly did the dance direction and I have to say pinch hit admirably for Busby Berkeley . The big hit song of the film was Jolson singing and Keeler dancing to About a Quarter to Nine . It was nicely staged and worthy of Berkeley in every sense of the word as Berkeley gave Jolson that awful Going ' to Heaven on a Mule in Wonder Bar . In this film the chorus of male dancers and Jolson all turn to blackface for a minute . Jolson also does the finale title song in blackface as well . Unfortunately not only does Jolson do blackface , but in this film , not once , but twice he rubs the head of black actor Fred "" Snowflake "" Toone for good luck . That particular bit of tastelessness kept Go Into Your Dance off the television screens for decades . I remember seeing it on WOR TV's million dollar movie as a lad in the Fifties , but never again until recently . The real pity is that we were also deprived of seeing Helen Morgan sing as well . Her alcoholism had gotten pretty bad at this point , but she was one of Broadway brightest stars . She sings The Little Things You Used to Do in her typical poignant fashion . It would have really been great to see her co-star with Jolson in a film , but that was not to be . Go Into Your Dance is quite a museum piece of a film and if you're not into Jolson , I would urge you to see it for Helen Morgan .


Text2: Realistic Racetrack movie Personally , I enjoy two atmospheres in life . Ballparks and racetracks . Baseball movies are usually about individual efforts , I've never seen one that captures the atmosphere of the game itself . But Boots Malone better than any other film I've seen about racing until last year's Seabiscuit , captures the whole flavor of the track itself . You can literally smell the manure ( and I don't mean that as a comment on the film ) when you watch this thing . The characters in and around the track are Damon Runyon like , but not romanticized in the way he usually did . There just the everyday folk you find there , working hard at something they love . A lot of the movie depends on the chemistry of the four principal players . That this film has in abundance . Bill Holden as the cynical jockey's agent , Stanley Clements as the over the hill jockey who's now an exercise rider , Basil Ruysdael as the owner of a claiming horse with hidden promise and finally Johnny Stewart as the naive teenage kid who runs away from boarding school to hang around the track , all of them work very well in the scenes they have that's about half the film . Bill Holden had three years earlier established himself as an actor to be reckoned with in Sunset Boulevard . No more nice guy parts , he's a tough cynical character . His Boots Malone is like Joe Gillis , a cynical survivor , also like Sefton in Stalag 17 . Unlike those other two characters , we're shown the reason for Malone's cynicism and alienation , his wife and kid were killed several years earlier in a car crash . The kid , Tommy Gibson played by Johnny Stewart , get to Malone . Bit by bit as Holden shows him the ropes around the racetrack community they develop a strong bond . Some of the best scenes in the film are those with Holden teaching Stewart the fundamentals of the jockey trade . Johnny Stewart should have had a major film career . He had charisma and good acting skills in abundance . After this he made one more film and then left Hollywood to resume acting on the Broadway stage . I would love to know whatever happened to him . I love this film very much and if you love the racetrack this film is a must .

125,"Text1: maybe the most mixed-bag kind of film I've seen from Fellini yet ( and I'm a big fan ) I have to think that with a production like Satyricon , co-written and directed ( and practically ring-mastered ) by Federico Fellini , he had a couple of things he had to adhere to in what he could or couldn't show ( not sure what Italy's policies were on nudity or violence and such ) . But overall , this seems to me to be the kind of film where the director had such carte Blanche and freedom to do with whatever he wanted with the material , no one ever even tried to reel him in or ask ' does this make sense ? ' Maybe that's what makes Satyricon the flawed plum that it is , but it's sometimes a slog getting through it . It's a shame to say things as pat about Fellini Satyricon like ' it's meandering ' or ' it loses cohesion ' or ' I asked ' who is that character again ' too much ' , but they pretty much do apply , even if you are a really big fan of the movie . In a sense I am too , but not exactly at the same time . In the purely visual sense , it's what the word spectacular really comes closest to in terms of personal Roman epics . Surreal or bizarre or debauchery comes to mind as well , but really if this was a silent film ( and it comes to mind a couple of times that Fellini would have risen to the likes of Lang or even Eisenstein if he had been making films in the silent era ) , it would be in my top ten of all time . Through one of the great Italian master cinematographers , Giuseppe Rutono , Fellini glides and pirouettes and makes his Roman epic with the mad ideas and persistence to not back away from keeping the vision consistent . At the least , Fellini never makes it a drag to look at , and his production values - the designs and mix of real locations with expansive Cinecitta sets , usage of colors , costumes , props ( including severed limbs and heads ) , and adding to this Nino Rota & company's strange musical accompaniments - are just as superb , if not even more extravagant , than those for his previous color film Juliet of the Spirits . If the visuals and the look and style of the film help make this world of Rome where there's no real authority and sex and power is up for grabs , the actual substance then has to be taken into account . I understand too what Fellini was after , in terms of not just the period of Rome at the time ( I'm not sure totally when , but in the apparent absence of senators and the republic ) , but also in the sexual and political revolutions going on across the world . There's madness in every direction , just as , at least seemingly , in real life . But what Fellini is lacking is a portal for the viewer to really latch onto with this travelogue of Encolpio ( Martin Potter ) , who starts off with a slave , loses him , tries to find him , but ends up with a friend Ascylito . There's big fights while slaves themselves on a boat , decadent romps with ladies , more fights - to the point of them being gladiatorial - and only brief moments where Fellini lets the viewer take a rest from all the large pomp and circumstance . There's a lot of energy to many scenes , sexually charged in fact , and the first half of the film flows really well . Yet after a while , the narrative thread - or what may be left of it can't be made this loose for too long before not feeling as satisfactory as the images surrounding it . In a sense , I realize , this film could even make a comparison with Antonioni's Zabriskie Point as two films from Italian directors who take on the complete abandonment of morals and social order and relish ( and sometimes recoil ) in the thought of it actually taking place . If neither director is totally successful , it's no wonder why the term Carte-Blanche and wild auteur filmmaker only once in a while mix excellently .


Text2: Thoroughly enjoyable , memorable characters and scenes , an early classic in humanist / prison escape films I can't deny that Jean Renoir has a genuine eye for human connectedness and moves his camera with a practical naturalness . The performances by the principal actors as well ( Jean Gabin as the working-class Marechal , Pierre Fresnay as the eloquent Boieldieu , Marcel Dalio as the subtle and happy Rosenthal , and Erich von Stroheim as the un-mistakenly stiffest and suavest of movie prison wardens Captain von Rauffenstein ) are on the money every step of the way . Perhaps my one problem ( and it's not a big one ) with The Grand Illusion is that despite it being made at a time when cinema , in particular sound cinema , was just starting out , there could've been better targets hit by Renoir . He hits on a mark with these prisoners as well as with the guards - these are regular people , caught up and made to feel like they're in the schoolyard with ruthless heads and rebellious minions . As a satire , for some reason , it works a lot better for me than a drama - at least at first . For example , when Marechal is in solitary in the first prison , this is a masterpiece of a scene in and of itself , and for some reason I wanted more moments like this . While this could be attributable to the fact that Renoir didn't film everything he had intended with his script ( lack of budget one can assume ) , there are some expectations that weren't up to what could've been met . This may be variable from viewer to viewer , which is why this shouldn't deter those interested in seeing this - this is one of those POW films that's inspired others ( i . e . Great Escape ) , but has a sort of spirit that's all it's own . On the other hand in what comes out when one takes more of a look - which Renoir allows through how watchable ( in terms of just being able to not turn off the film once it starts ) the drama does become integrated with the critical view of the characters and changing situation . It's almost TOO complex , if that's possible . One of the fantastic joys of Grand Illusion is how much there is life and energy in his scenes depicting the prisons of world war one . Like in a Fellini drama ( which it may very well have inspired for the later Italian ) , there's a lot pf love for how cinema is made itself to get too depressed with the story & characters . And like in a neo-realist film , the dialog between the people is quite realistic and interesting . Some of the supporting characters / actions may seem odd to some new viewers , although one has to take into context the period . With an awesome cameraman ( Christian Matras ) , finite music score by Joseph Kosma , and an escape scene that's almost as thrilling as what Darabont cooked up in Shawshank , Grand Illusion is deservedly so the first film released by the Criterion collection ( DVDs ) , and is a suave , nice note in film history . AND , it definitely becomes better upon repeat viewings , as these characters become more familiar , as if we're in there in the prisons with these amicable , existential beings .

This is a run of the mill little film who ? s dreams out distance its reach . Normally I ? d stop there and say that its worth seeing if you run across it but you didn't have to search it out . This time however I'm going to do something different and say that if you want to see a really good performance and what is sure to be an early performance by someone who is sure to be a big actress see this film . Rebecca Neuenswander who plays Katherine Parker , the fighter , is amazing . She gives a performance that is assured and radiant ( even when she ? s getting punched in the face ) . She is haunting in away that few actresses are .

Text2: "" Let's take ' em to Mexico ! "" The opening Civil War battle scene in "" The Undefeated "" takes place three days after General Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House , the opposing Colonels receiving word of the news via a courier on the battlefield . Union Colonel John Henry Thomas ( John Wayne ) is only too glad to get on with civilian life . He takes the remains of his once seventy five member regiment , now reduced to ten , on a drive to deliver wild horses to Mexico's Emperor Maximillian . His opponent , Confederate Colonel James Langdon ( Rock Hudson ) , disaffected with the War , intends to lead his men and their families to a new life via Durango and on to Mexico City . Along the way , the two Colonels renew acquaintances , in a virtual bygones be bygones ritual cemented by trading barbs and slugs of whiskey . But it won't be long before trouble begins , as Mexican banditos lay in ambush for the Confederate wagon train , seeking horses , gold and women , not necessarily in that order . Colonel Thomas had the foresight to send his adopted Cherokee son Blue Boy ( L . A . Rams Quarterback Roman Gabriel ) away from the Confederate party , to round up his redskin brothers to help save the day . From there on , the story meanders it's way along with some side stories involving a talented supporting cast that includes Bruce Cabot , Jan-Michael Vincent , Ben Johnson , and another football notable , Merlin Olsen . However you can't convince me that the women on the Confederate wagon train exhibit any degree of authenticity , as Lee Meriwether , Melissa Newman and Marian McCargo are all just too darn pretty , not a hair out of place and dressed to the nines in every scene , even when they pick up rifles to fight the bandits . Having just watched John Wayne in the 1948 film "" Fort Apache "" , I was conscious of a possible reference to the Shirley Temple character in that film when Colonel Thomas and Colonel Langdon have a conversation . Thomas responds to his Southern counterpart "" Not like Philadelphia "" , which was the name of Temple's character . When Langdon seeks clarification , Thomas says never mind . Any insight into that exchange would be appreciated . Following the film's progress for two hours , the ending comes as a bit of a letdown , as one expects the alliance between the Union and Confederate Colonels to lead a final charge against the Juarista General Rojas ( Antonio Aguilar ) , who holds the members of Langdon's wagon train hostage in exchange for Colonel Thomas ' horses . Instead , Thomas agrees to the terms , presumably to insure a fight for another day and another movie .

Text2: "" Notah's brother talks like the white man he thinks he is , he's afraid to be Comanche . "" I had more than a little trepidation approaching this film , but you know what , it wasn't that bad . Casting William Shatner is a little like putting Lorne Greene in command of a space ship , but for the most part it worked , sort of . He pulled off the part of Johnny Moon decently enough , the brother who went off to grow up as a white man . However as Notah , the psychedelic Comanche warrior , Shatner whoops it up a bit embarrassingly , but then again his character regularly got high on peyote buttons and mystic visions . Funny , but it seemed to me that Notah looked about ten years younger than Johnny . Joseph Cotten is the only other major name here , portraying Sheriff Logan of Rio Hondo . He had a kind of watered down Gary Cooper look , but at least he stood for law and order and wasn't afraid to mix it up when the bad guys hit town . He didn't get very far preventing the gunfight between the General Garcia and Grimes gangs , even taking a bullet for his trouble . Ultimately though , his presence in the film didn't seem to add up to much . There are a couple of scenes you ought to keep your eyes on . When Johnny shoots Garcia's brother following an ambush , he begins rolling toward a cliff . As his body makes its ' way over , note how he uses his hand to ever so slightly push away from the rock . The other is an outright result of the director and his crew not paying attention . In the duel on horseback between Johnny and Notah , Johnny rides a black horse and Notah is on a brown horse . After it's over , the wounded Johnny rides into view and falls off a brown horse . Then when it's time to lead the Comanches back to the reservation he's back on a black horse again . At least as a white Comanche there was no guesswork . Though not on a par with Clint Eastwood's Italian Westerns , this flick is still entertaining enough , if nothing more than to see William Shatner go where he had not gone before . Except for appearances in a number of TV Westerns , I can't think of another cowboy movie he might have been in . The picture has taken a few hits from other posters on this site , but if you're inclined to dismiss it as one of the worst Westerns ever made , try making it through "" Cry Blood , Apache . ""

Text2: Lethal Weapon II rekindles the excitement and action packed success generated by the original film two years earlier . Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs team up again for another great action film . No time is wasted in the second installment in this now classic action series . Lethal Weapon II starts out immediately with a car chase , starting off what is to be a very entertaining film . Murtaugh and Riggs have the same personalities that they had before , and as is to be expected , they worked excellently on screen . Roger is the family man again , having major crises over the fact that his coming-of-age daughter has landed a spot in a condoms commercial ( which he is teased about for the remainder of the movie ) , and Riggs is still the hyperactive cop with a few screws loose . Riggs now reveals that he has a talent for popping his shoulder in and out of its socket , one of the elements of the film that worked well as far as helping the story along , but that is just ridiculous in reference to real life situations . If you were wondering if a person could pop a dislocated shoulder back into place , painfully or otherwise , by smacking it on a wall or on the side of a car , I can pretty much assure you that it just doesn't work that way . It was funny to watch though , wasn't it ? This is the installment where we are introduced to Leo Getz ( played hilariously by Joe Pesci ) , who is the anxious but mostly unwelcome addition to Riggs ' and Murtaugh's partnership . I think that they overloaded his mistreatment just a little too much for the film , Leo seemed to take entirely too much from Riggs and Murtaugh to keep cooperating with them . Nevertheless , this was still a great action film . In a memorable scene in Roger's bathroom involving a toilet bomb , he and Riggs are even able to successfully display an emotionally charged scene , even for this type of fast paced action film ( in which almost any type of emotional involvement is usually clumsily thrown in to attract a larger audience ( females ) in true Jerry Bruckheimer form ) . And they even manage to jerk a few tears near the end in regards to Riggs ' stunningly beautiful new girlfriend . As has become tradition in the Lethal Weapon series , there has to be at least one scene where just as the ? normal ' police arrive , Riggs is staggering away from the destruction of a flaming crime scene breathlessly saying that everything is under control . This is done and overdone in the entire series , and it never seems to get tiring . The gunfights are great , the chases are better , and the action overall is excellently done by Richard Donner for the second time , but there were some things that just should have been left out or changed completely . For example , the helicopter shootout scene at Riggs ' ' house ' was a little too excessive . It was too hard to believe that he and his girlfriend could have dodged THAT many bullets . It was cool to watch , but there's no way they could have avoided getting hit at least once . Also , I refuse to believe that ANY pick-up truck could have pulled the stilts out from under a house like it was done in the film . That was just too much . Even if some super-powerful pickup was ever able to do that , there's no way it could have gotten out of the way of the falling structure fast enough to avoid getting crushed by it . However , despite such disturbing weaknesses as these , Lethal Weapon II was a great movie . The things I mentioned above were badly unrealistic , and probably couldn't even be pulled off by a professional stunt team , but they worked really well with the story . The shootout scene with the helicopters created some good tension , regardless of how unrealistic it was . Also , with the kind of people who were in that house , you WANT to see the foundation pulled out from under them , and having Riggs do it not only fits perfectly with his personality , and it also almost makes you want to get up and cheer for him . This is a very good action film . It is virtually non-stop action from the opening scene , and it has a good ending , which is in my opinion","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The first part of the film leads up to that moment , and we already know what is going to be revealed . Think of it as watching a contest knowing who the winner is beforehand . Then there's how obvious and by-the-numbers the film is . Face it , it was really predictable . No great twists here . At one point , something out of the ordinary happened , and I hoped it was going to keep it up . . . a minute later , everything was back to normal . This wouldn't really be that much of a pain if it wasn't for how freakishly slow and dull the better part of the film is , and if this was the first of its kind . . . but it was , and it isn't .

133,"Text1: Grace Moore's Oscar-nominated role in very dated musical . . . Unlike MGM's favorite soprano , JEANETTE MacDONALD , other singers from the Met tried screen careers at various times in the ' 30s , but none emerged winning enough as screen personalities to rival Jeanette . Columbia tried hard with GRACE MOORE and this is undoubtedly one of her better efforts at attaining screen stardom . TULLIO CARMINATI is amusingly persistent as her demanding voice coach who discovers her singing "" Ciribiribin "" in a cellar cafe before offering to become her tutor . LYLE TALBOT is her boyfriend with marriage on his mind . But the silly script has Miss Moore acting like a spoiled prima donna , cavorting with boyfriend Talbot while supposedly training for her big moment as "" Carmen "" . A series of misunderstandings involving another woman , MONA BARRIE ( strongly resembling Kay Francis ) , makes up much of the backstage part of the story and only weakens the overall film . Moore is fine whenever she's singing but the lip synch is way off during the final "" Un Bel Di "" and it's hard to see where her performance earned her an Oscar nomination for the acting part of her role . Summing up : A disappointment for me , regardless of glowing tributes from the other commentators on this particular film .


Text2: Nice drama of early aviation pioneers . . . Sturdy , dependable GLENN FORD gives another one of his understated but sincere performances as a young inventor , John Montgomery , in the late 1800s who makes a number of semi-successful attempts at getting his flying machine off the ground and soaring into the atmosphere . JANET BLAIR is the love interest as the childhood sweetheart who stands by her man until the end of his life . While I always liked this actress , the jarring note is her make-up which is so modern that it seems like an anachronism . She has a distinctly 1940s look about her ( lip gloss and modern hairdos ) that works against the otherwise authentic look of the film . WILLARD ROBERTSON as Ford's pa is fine but SELENA ROYLE is completely wasted in a minor role as his loving mom . William Wellman directs with a thorough knowledge of his subject and as an aviation drama it maintains interest throughout . All of the aerial scenes are well staged and look glorious in crisp B & W photography . Summing up : A very unheralded film that is certainly watchable but could have used a stronger and less sentimental script .

134,"Text1: Pixar's most "" epic "" animated film since "" Toy Story . "" Although "" The Incredibles "" is not the best film Pixar has released ( via Disney ) since 1995's "" Toy Story , "" I felt it is the most epic . When I went to go see "" Toy Story "" in 1995 , the epic scale of the picture - - the non-stop frantic pace , the action sequences , etc . - - were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as , believe it or not , a blockbuster such as "" Terminator 2 "" : a crowd-pleasing , overwhelming picture . "" Monsters , Inc . "" wasn't quite as epic . It was a great movie , just as good as "" Toy Story , "" but it didn't have the same style per se . "" Finding Nemo "" was very good as well but still didn't capture the same epic scale as "" Toy Story . "" ( I'm not saying that's a bad thing , just different . ) "" The Incredibles "" seemed to . I saw it on DVD and from beginning to end the action is non-stop , the laughs aplenty , and the exotic locations and action-hero references continuous . For this reason , somehow , it reminded me very much of "" Toy Story . "" It seemed like older Pixar , rather than some of their newer stuff ( all of which is great as well ) . Pixar has yet to make a bad movie . Even their worst - - "" A Bug's Life "" - - was better than most animated films . "" The Incredibles "" also returns to the spoof roots of "" Monsters , Inc . "" and "" Toy Story "" ( something "" Finding Nemo "" did but not as often ) - - it parodies cultural references . ( Something hard to do in an underwater sea adventure . ) Although this is a family film , it is NOT a "" children's film . "" That is evident from the beginning when the fake news reel in "" The Incredibles "" features articles about a suicidal man suing superheroes because he "" didn't want to be saved . "" This is clearly a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the shameless legal standards of the day . ( Such as the woman who sued McDonald's because her coffee was too hot . A true story ! ) Another film might not be clever enough to integrate iconic cultural references into itself but "" The Incredibles "" does . Similarly , using superheroes , Pixar examines the at-home relationship of a family and spoofs our own rituals . ( Such as eating at the dinner table - - the mom tries to stop the squabbling kids just like we do , only because she has superpowers , it's a bit . . . different . ) All in all "" The Incredibles "" really is a great animated film . I enjoyed it more than "" Finding Nemo "" ( which I didn't expect to as I loved "" Nemo "" ) and just as much as "" Toy Story "" and "" Monsters , Inc . "" Pixar has solidified a new style of family film-making - - the cultural parody animated film - - and the evidence of this can be seen in such take-offs of the formula as "" Shrek "" and "" Shark Tale "" ( which featured many cultural references as well ) . All in all "" The Incredibles "" is incredibly fun . And funny .


Text2: "" . . . don't tune me out , hang on a while , this is a big story . . . "" What's interesting for me in watching "" Foreign Correspondent "" is trying to imagine how American audiences of the time might have felt while on the doorstep of World War II with Europe about to blow up . In this country for only a short time , director Hitchcock's set pieces recreate the cities of London and Amsterdam in a tale of spies and traitors operating under the guise of a Universal Peace Party . It's chairman Fisher ( Herbert Marshall ) orchestrates the kidnapping of Dutch partner Van Meer ( Albert Bassermann ) , who has committed the details of a secret peace agreement to memory . Clause 27 turns out to be a classic Hitchcock maguffin , a device planted in the story to rouse the interest of the viewer , though it's details are never revealed . In fact , it's not necessary to do so , because the film's sleight of hand diverts us to assassination attempts , a Dutch windmill hideout for the villains and a harrowing plane crash into the ocean before it's all over . The intrigue moves along nicely with Joel McCrae as Morning Globe reporter Johnny Jones , who finds himself in the thick of things in more ways than one . He gets lured into the espionage drama after he witnesses what looks like the assassination of ambassador Van Meer , though by this time he's also becoming romantically involved with Carol Fisher ( Laraine Day ) . She's the daughter of the mastermind behind the spy ring , but having grown up British , her loyalty is staunchly pro Brit and anti war . Hitch builds suspense in the film on any number of levels , and each time it works , even when he goes for an ' in your face ' moment like Rowley's ( Edmund Gwenn ) attempt to push Johnny from the top of the cathedral . You know instinctively that Jones / Haverstock can't be dead , yet you maintain ever the slightest doubt until you see him again in the very next scene . But for sheer terror , the scenes of the ocean plane crash survivors scrambling onto the wreckage is about the most surreal and insane piece of film making ever , made all the more terrifying if you think of yourself being there . Personally , I can't even imagine confronting a horror like that , much less hanging on long enough to survive . Though not remembered as one of Hitchcock's better known films , the movie was nominated for six Oscars in it's day , ironically pitted against Hitch's first American film "" Rebecca "" which won Best Picture in 1941 . Though it may seem somewhat dated today , one can still have a good time with the movie by glossing over the less believable elements and riding it out for the mystery and adventure .

Text2: The abyss Copycat killings of a psychopath on death row named Shin Hyun ( Seung-woo Cho , creepy in a chilling role ) emerge as bodies of slashed pregnant women are found with their embryos forcefully extracted . Detective Kim ( Jung-ah Yum ) takes a special interest in this case because her fianc√© committed suicide after accidentally letting Shin go before he murdered six women in a row . Interesting enough is Shin turned himself in . Wet-behind-the-ears Detective Kang ( Jin-hee Ji , very good ) becomes embroiled with the case desperately craving to catch those responsible for the murders , but his visits with Shin will alter his life forever . When interviewing Shin for answers as to whom might be responsible for copycatting his handiwork , he speaks in riddles never quite making himself clear . During the film , the detectives realize that Shin's therapist , Dr . Chu ( Sun-kyung Kim ) , may have important information regarding Shin and if he is actually masterminding the killings behind bars . If you are willing to accept certain unusual aspects that lead to killing innocent young women such as the possible angle dealing with hypnosis presented here , it might be much more compelling . The major tie in the film is the links to abortions carried out by several victims of Shin . Shin's past relationship with his mother is also a major source to the killings as well . Perhaps too slick for it's own good , this offering from Tartan Extreme is stylishly directed and quite well-acted . It could be seen as a bit contrived , but I found it fascinating from start to finish .

136,"Text1: There's a Darkman two now ? Only very recently I found out there's a second - and even a third - Darkman movie available on the rental market . Another member of the horror forum on this website reviewed all three of them a couple of months ago , and it was through his thread and directions I found my way to "" The Return of Durant "" ( part two ) and "" Die Darkman Die "" ( part three ) . Talk about anonymous releases ! It's not too surprising , since the original Sam Raimi film was fairly successful and definitely showed sequel potential , but it's still weird the producers opted for such a modest and inconspicuous release . Anyway , I wasn't in too much of a hurry to track them down , but I was remotely interested in the first sequel because Larry Drake reprises his glorious role of the mega-malevolent but ultra-cool villain Robert G . Durant . Partly because he was one of the main attractions in the original but mostly because I was curious to see how exactly they would bring his character back from the death , since he died pretty nastily in a helicopter crash at the end of the first "" Darkman "" . Here I was imagining possible scenarios where Durant would get cloned or perhaps even resurrected through using some of the advanced scientific research Peyton Westlake was researching , but nooooooooooooooo ! The almighty Robert G . Durant awakes from a three year coma from one moment onto the other ! How freaking unimaginative and in fact quite impossible if you remember the images of that helicopter crash . Darkman himself transformed from Liam Neeson into Arnold Vosloo ( a horrible actor with the most random face ) but you're not supposed to notice that and his whole romantic background with Frances McDormand suddenly vanished as well . Other than that , "" Darkman II "" carries on where Raimi's film finished , as Peyton Westlake still alters scientific research with prowling the crime-infested streets as an avenging angel . He finally found a partner who's able to help him with the fine-tuning of his synthetic skin development , but this doctor then gets killed by Durant and his accomplices because he's laboratory is the ideal factory to construct illegal weapons . More than reason enough for Darkman to go after Durant again and finish him off for good this time . "" Darkman II "" isn't as disastrous as it looks , I have to admit . It's a textbook and completely unsurprising B-movie , but that doesn't mean it can't be fun . There are several grotesquely absurd action scenes with big guns and nasty falls from great heights . This franchise has a thing with characters falling from heights , for sure ! The stunts and make-up effects are obviously less impressive here than in the original , but the budget was restricted and director Bradford May indisputably isn't playing in the same league as Sam Raimi . The film's main trump is Larry Drake and , of course , his sadistic one-liners and grim facial expressions . The entire movie revolves around him , and that's quite logical since Arnold Vosloo is a terrible actor . B-movie beauty queen Kim Delaney is a joy to behold as well , but her share in the script is sadly too small . Not bad if you have an hour and a half to waste , but forget everything you know about the violent and comic-book styled original masterwork .

Looking for a Bobby Burns who fit the description of the killer LA detective Jerry Beck checks out this biker place only to find Bobby Burns younger brother John who's not very helpful in the murder investigation . With Jerry trying to get John to talk about his brothers whereabouts out of nowhere this guy jumps out of the window , Jerry runs him down it what seemed like the length of the Boston Marathon . Jerry after running down tackling and cuffing the fugitive seems to uncontrollably , like it wasn't in the script but a sudden bodily function on his part , vomits not once but twice all over the poor mans shirt . It also turned out to Jerry's embarrassment that the person Jimmy Ellis wasn't the guy , Bobby Burns , that he was after . Jerry's on pins and needles with his marriage on the rocks and his estranged wife Karen not letting him see his two kids as well as him being told to have a psychiatric examination by an LAPD assigned shrink to see if he's fit for duty . Christmas night Jerry attends a policeman single's party and meets and spends the night at his pad with Linda who he later finds out to his surprise and shock was the wife , estranged but still married to , of Officer Gary Kimble who was shot just the day before ! how much can one man take without going off his rocker ! It seemed that the person involved with the shootings in LA went west to Cottonwood Arizona and , together with his friends , shot up a bar robbing and killing everyone in it . That incident has Jerry put back on the case and sent to Arizona to help , the Cottonwood police , in finding the killers . With the help of the local Cottonwood sheriff Jerry tracks down the killers to this farm and after a violent shootout the trio get away . Checking the farm house Jerry finds that the three fugitives left behind a map and letters about a big Neo-Nazi meeting to be held at a place called the Shelby Ranch in Colorado where the three are headed for . As you would expect nobody takes Jerry seriously since he's such a flake even though he has the evidence , the map and the letters , right in his hands . Even the local FBI man Arthur Kressler assigned to the murder case , since the murders crossed state lines , treats Jerry like he was a conspiracy nut , in him saying that the Neo-Nazis were planing to overthrow the US government , gone out of control . It takes a kidnapping , by Bobby Burns , and almost murder of Jerry Beck to finally convinces the FBI that Jerry may be on to something . Together with Boulder Sheriff Dixon's men Jerry and FBI agent Kressler storm the Shelby Ranch . Jerry & Co . not only find out the truth about what the persons there lead by the "" Right Reverend "" Ghbhardt , the Neo-Nazi religious Fuhuer , were planing for the future of America ! Even more important it's found out who was behind the LA and Cottonwood Arizona murders , in which Officer Kimble was a victim , and what were the real and sick reasons behind them . Interesting but a bit complicated police thriller that mixes Neo-Nazis street thugs and a lot of emotional and mental instability , on both sides of the law , together in making a fairly good story . It was interesting to see a young William Forsythe as the FBI man Arthur Kressler being so goody two shoes , like a combination boy scout and altar boy , who became so upset with LAPD's Jerry Beck for as much as using off-color language to the point of almost coming to blows with him !

138,"Text1: Mein Fuhrer . . . . . I Can Walk ! "" Dr . Strangelove "" had to have seemed strange indeed to 1964 audiences . This came out in the same year as colorful , old-fashioned Hollywood fare like "" My Fair Lady "" and "" Mary Poppins . "" Yet "" Strangelove "" is far from old-fashioned or even colorful . Kubrick's film is stark and cold with a documentary-like air to it . It's also riotously funny . Peter Sellers is a film treasure . This film is a an orgy for Sellers fans , since he plays no less than three different characters , stretching his chameleon-like acting abilities to the limit . The funniest of his three characters is the dead-pan president of the United States , and the film's funniest scene involves him trying to gently break to the Russian premiere that we are about to launch a nuclear attack on his country . His portrayal of the title character is also inspired , and the image of Sellers in that wheelchair wrestling his black-gloved hand into submission with that crazy shock of hair and crazier glint in his eyes is unforgettable . The film also sports a great supporting cast , most notably George C . Scott as Buck Turgison , who discreetly takes calls from his bikini-clad girlfriend during war room briefings , Sterling Hayden as General Jack D . Ripper , who wields his cigar like a dangerous weapon , and Slim Pickens , as the pilot of the plane that is about to end civilization as we know it . My only complaint with the film is its somewhat sluggish editing , especially in the scenes showing the fleet of bombers on its way to their Russian targets . At times , the movie actually drags slightly , even though it's only 90 minutes long . But this is a minor quibble about a film that has rightly earned a spot in the cultural conscience of America . It will never be irrelevant as long as the ability to wage nuclear war exists , and it doesn't look like that problem will be going away any time soon .


Text2: When Hitchcock Comes to Middle America It's been reported that the primary appeal of doing "" Shadow of a Doubt "" for Alfred Hitchcock was the idea of bringing a sense of menace to a small , every day American town . In that , this movie brilliantly succeeds . It doesn't join "" Rear Window "" or "" Psycho "" as one of my favorite Hitchcock films , but it has much to recommend it . Joseph Cotten didn't get many chances to play a sinister villain , but he's very good at it . His natural ease and charm work to his advantage in creating a smarmy character who you're never completely sure about . He has a lot of chemistry with Teresa Wright , who plays his niece and supposedly has a closer than normal connection with him . In fact , in typical Hitchcock fashion , their relationship in the early scenes of this film takes on a sort of creepy romantic quality that's never overtly addressed but is always there as subtext . As Wright begins to suspect that her Uncle Charlie might not be such a great guy after all - - and may in fact be much worse than simply not a great guy - - the balance of power shifts and she begins to play against him . One of the things I liked most about this movie was how strong a character Wright's Charlie is allowed to be . She's not a ninny , like a character in her situation would be in any number of other films . She doesn't swoon , cry and squeal helplessly . After Uncle Charlie tries to kill her by locking her in a garage with a running car , and she comes to looking directly into his face , she doesn't bite her knuckles as you might expect , but rather says with a cold hard determination , "" Go away . "" It's very effective , and the whole movie is like that . It has a great supporting cast , both well cast and acted . There's not a throwaway character among the bunch , and everyone makes much of varying sized roles . Patricia Collinge is a stand out as Uncle Charlie's sister , whose radar is going off even as she doesn't want to believe anything sinister can be happening . Henry Travers is the father of the family . . . his attitudes toward Charlie change after he comes to the bank where he works and makes inappropriate jokes . It wasn't until the end credits that I even realized who Hume Cronyn was playing ; I've never seen him so young . "" Shadow of a Doubt "" isn't as obviously distinguished visually as other Hitchcock films , but it bears his unmistakable mark nonetheless . There aren't as many shots you come away from the film remembering as there are in , say , "" Rear Window . "" But the whole thing has the feeling of being completely controlled from beginning to end . I really liked the way small-town America was portrayed in this film . It's not full of a bunch of rubes who say things like "" aw shucks "" and do silly things for us to laugh at . Hitchcock is skillful at showing the contrast between the small-town life of young Charlie's family and Uncle Charlie's jaded big-city life of crime . But he doesn't condescend or patronize . If you want to see higher-tier Hitchcock , you could do much worse than this film . It's got an engaging story , wonderful acting and complex characters , and a few scenes that qualify as genuine nail biters . Very good !

Maybe it was from his heavy drug use , that altered his sense of reality , that Lind didn't see the inevitable coming . Just three days earlier on June 29 , 1981 Lind together with his two drug dealing and sniffing friends Ron Lanius & Billy Deverel , Josh Lucas & Tim Blake Nelson , raided Eddie Nash's , Eric Bogosian , pad and ended up not only taking over one million dollars of drugs jewelry cash and even antique guns from him they also brutalized and humiliated Nash ! This is something that Nash won't forget and make sure that those who did it will end up paying for it .

Setting up Nash to get hit by the Lanius gang Holmes never thought that Nash will retaliated against him since he kept himself out of the loop staying home with Dawn while Lanius and his boys did all the dirty work . Not having to be a Sherlock Holmes to figure out that Holmes , who was dealing with both Lanius and Nash , had set him up Nash them had Holmes kidnapped beaten and forced to reveal who was behind the June 29 , 1981 raid on his pad . It was then that Holmes agreed to set up the Lanius gang the same way he set up Nash , by leaving the door open to their place , and Nash's hoods did the rest . But unlike with Nash who survived together with his 300 pound bodyguard Greg Diles , Falzon Love , and sable of hookers the Lanius gang with the exception of Lanius ' wife Susan , Christina Applegate , ended up being brutally beaten to death . John Holmes managed to keep himself from being rubbed out by Nash and imprisoned for both drug and murder charges by the California , as well as Federal , Justice Department by giving out just enough information about the Wonderland murders to have him given some kind of witness protection . Later when the LAPD and Feds got tired of playing games with him and put Holmes on trial he did in fact beat the rap by being found innocent of the killings in a court of law !

Text2: Detailed documentary about the great studio "" MGM : When the Lion Roars "" is a 1992 documentary hosted by Patrick Stewart . Shown in three parts on Turner Classic Movies , it tells the story of the monolithic studio from its beginnings , taking us through the influence of the great Irving Thalberg , after his death , during World War II , after the war , the growth of television , and MGM's eventual demise . All of the studios had a particular look to their films and a strong point of view . MGM was known for its huge array of stars , its opulence , its classy musicals , and its family entertainment , especially under the aegis of Louis B . Mayer . Even its "" B "" movies , such as Dr . Kildare , had "" A "" movie quality . The studio's main problem was its lack of foresight and lack of awareness that the audience changed over time . The belief was that television was a fad , for instance - major error . And all the studios suffered when the courts broke up studio ownership of the movie theaters . The documentary is highly entertaining , filled with interviews , scenes , and musical numbers . Stewart voices the incorrect information that Jean Harlow died because her mother's religion didn't allow her to have treatment . Jean Harlow died of kidney disease , for which there was no cure , no transplant , no dialysis . She had plenty of medical attention , but there was nothing anyone could do once she developed the disease . Very enjoyable and well worth seeing .

143,"Text1: A Duck Tale With Mountain Lion A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . The Little Ranger enjoys his job as guide at the Grand Canyon , until tourist Donald and a ferocious Mountain Lion give him a really bad day . . . This enjoyable little comedy doubtless got its name as it was one of Disney's first releases in Cinemascope . It also marked the final appearance in a Disney cartoon of the Mountain Lion , who retired to a cave in California's Hollywood Hills . Clarence "" Ducky "" Nash provided the voice for Donald ; Bill Thompson did the honors for Ranger J . Audubon Woodlore . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .


Text2: Wrong Messages from Both Sides Another of those ' written , directed , starring ' movies that should have been filtered through a careful producing team , SAY UNCLE will probably get an audience because of Peter Paige's fans from QUEER AS FOLK ( it looks like the entire cast and team put up the money for the production ! ) . The theme of the story is an important one - single gay men who love children are targets for homophobic people to label as sexual predators - but the film fails to engage us on both sides of the fence . Paul Johnson ( Peter Paige ) is bonded to his godson and in every way seems the perfect godfather - if a bit too much on the infantile side of maturity . His world collapses when his friends move with his godson to Japan and Paul realizes he has nothing . He loses his job , grazes on donuts , and finally begins to seek employment in kids ' stores , baby-sitting , and other kid related projects ( even trying to adopt a child while jobless ) , all the while playing with kids in the park . The mothers in the park all love the fact that he appears to be a stay-at-home dad who entertains their own children , until one mother ( Kathy Najimy ) becomes suspect that he is a pedophile and organizes the city against him . The ending is predictable and phony and doesn't say much that is good about either Paul's manner of adapting to his life needs nor the mothers ' taking responsibility for their misjudging : it just ends . Paige is a talented guy but he needs a good director to give him some insights on how to step out of clich√©s and stereotypes and become at least a facsimile of a real human being . Oddly enough we are left with a feeling that his ' Paul ' is a man who behaves like a child and will probably never cross the line into adulthood . The supporting cast is satisfactory but the production values are weak . The redeeming factor is the sense that everyone had a good idea to explore : the journey just doesn't compel us .

144,"Text1: Only the Names are Retained . It's kind of like "" Sex and the Single Girl "" or "" What You've Always Wanted to Know About Sex . "" The titles are familiar or engaging enough to justify building a complete story from scratch . ( See also , "" The Best of Sex and Violence , "" which is the greatest title ever dreamed up , far superior to , say , "" Henry IV , Part Two . "" ) The novel opens and closes with slam bang action scenes and there isn't much in between to draw us to the characters . One-armed guys can be good heroes or villains , but not heroes who lose . The story is that Howard Hawks and Hemingway were having drinks and that Hawks claimed he could take even Hemingway's lousiest novel and make a successful movie out of it . They agreed that "" To Have And Have Not "" was about the lousiest and the bet was made . Evidently Furthman threw the contents of the novel out of the window except for the general Caribbean setting , Harry Morgan's occupation as skipper , and the names of some of the characters . It's doubtful that Hawks truly enjoyed himself during the shooting . He had a habit of hiring delicious young women for his movies and then , well , then bonding with them . In this case , he had his eye on Bacall , who was 18 years old , but she bonded with Bogart instead . Hawks also had a habit of avoiding actors who stole his women and punishing the women too , so it was Bogart's next-to-last film with Hawks . It wasn't the first time . In Kirk Douglas's movie with Hawks , the actor stole Elizabeth Threatt , a major masochist , who came like water and like the wind she went . And it was good-bye to both John Ireland and Joanne Dru after "" Red River . "" Poor Hawks . The writers , which evidently included Jules Furthman and William Faulkner , built up a story that sizzled with sexuality at the time of its release but seems like of loose-limbed , gangly , and amusing today . ( The oft-parodied scene in which Bacall tells Bogart how to whistle - - "" You just put your lips together - - and blow . "" ) Hawks had an affinity for boy's adventure book values . You know , a man rediscovers his pride or sobriety and overcomes his demons and whatnot . It's pretty lowbrow stuff unless you want to get into conjectural homoerotic themes . But Hawks had a solid sense of humor too . He had a tendency to rework scenes so that they had gag lines in them or amusing bits of business . This one has its funny moments too , as well as a bit of action . None of it is either gripping or believable but it's fun to watch . Bogart and Bacall really hit it off on screen . Her movements are so languorous . She hunches over a bit when she walks , like some tall women do . And her voice - - it's down there in the subwoofer range . At the end , when she and Bogie and Walter Brennan walk out of the bar , Hoagy Carmichael plays a lively little tune and Bacall does a sort of shimmy that must have sent shivers up the male spines of 1944 . While I think of it , I'll give an example of what I meant by "" amusing bits of business . "" The scene - - a French patriot must have a bullet extracted from his shoulder by Bogart . Several people stand around watching tensely . As Bogart probes the bullet hole , another beautiful woman , who Bacall is jealous of , faints to the floor . Bacall is administering ether from a spray can and Bogart tells her to fan the fumes away from the bed or they'll all be out . When Bacall notices that no one is watching her , she hastily fans the gas down towards the body of her unconscious rival . It isn't much , just a second or two , but it adds to our understanding of what's going on and is meanly funny . Not Hawks ' best but enjoyable viewing .


Text2: Yes . VERY bad . First of all , I am a HUGE fan of Billy Bob Thornton . He is without a doubt one of my favorite actors working today , but with Bad Santa he illustrates , unfortunately , that even he is capable of providing a wonderful performance in an awful , awful movie . The abysmal script for Bad Santa calls for a relentlessly unlikable , distasteful person , and Billy Bob does more than necessary to fill that requirement . He is a remarkably versatile actor , I can't help being reminded of the diversity of such roles as the government official in Armageddon , the greasy mechanic in U-Turn , the intense racist in Monster's Ball , the rather slow brother in the shocking film A Simple Plan , and the peculiar character that he played in Sling Blade . Unfortunately , the fact that Billy Bob is among the most powerful actors acting today is not enough to add something to the empty script of Bad Santa , which scarcely has any more reason for existence than do the ridiculous Scary Movies , which are abysmally awful films which I am notorious for repeatedly badmouthing - and for good reason - in dozens of my other reviews . ( spoilers ) Billy Bob Thornton plays the part of a dedicated drunk named Willie ( who deserves no last name and so is given none ) who plays the part of the shopping mall Santa Claus once a year , with his sidekick Marcus ( Tony Cox who cleverly gets upset at being called "" you people , "" something which he hasn't done since Me , Myself , and Irene . These writers are so creative ! ! ! ) . Marcus and Willie do not do the job because they enjoy it or because they are interested in earning a little extra cash for the holidays , they do it because being employees at the mall gains them access to the mall after closing . Marcus hides somewhere , then jumps out of hiding as the last security guard arms the alarm and walks out of the mall . Marcus jumps out and disarms the alarm before it can arm completely ( thus eliminating the annoying need for a code or password ) , and he then lets Willie in from where he has been waiting somewhere outside . The two proceed to rob the mall blind . Thus enters the premise which allows room for the comedic content , if you can call it that , of the film . Willie's an alcoholic who apparently survives the rest of the year on the money that he steals from one mall after another on his nationwide bad Santa sprees . Since he makes all of his money from stealing from the malls , it's not hard to see that he's not going to really enjoy being surrounded by slobbering kids all day since he is not interested in the hourly wage in the first place . Thus follows lots of groan-inducing streams of profanity sprayed at unsuspecting kids and their equally unsuspecting parents . Now , the profanity is one thing . It got real old real quick , but it's still , as they say , just one thing . Then you have the fact that Willie is constantly falling over drunk , smashing empty booze bottles against fancy SUVs in the parking lot on his way into the mall , and a whole array of other hideous infractions of basic decency . When I think about the character of Willie from this movie , I'm reminded of Melvin Udall from As Good As It Gets whose communication with the world , as Roger Ebert noted , was ' limited to insults intended to harm . ' But Jack Nicholson provided a charm to the character that I believe Billy Bob could also have provided Willie , had this ridiculous script called for it even in the most distant way . I'm also reminded of Billy from Buffalo ' 66 , another hideously unattractive and straight-forwardly mean person who displayed the social skills I expect must have been common sometime around the Cretaceous Period , but Billy was an ugly person in a movie that was also deliberately ugly . It was a compilation of cinematic skill that made Buffalo ' 66 ( and Billy ) look and act the way it / he did . Bad Santa is ugly and mean because the humor is simply bad . If I were to summarize , I would just say that if you are entertained by seeing an aging drunk screaming streams of profanity at a preteen boy for a HUNDRED AND","{""output"": ""NO""}"
145,"Text1: Notable for Making Me Hate Kiefer Sutherland Wow , I'm actually quite amazed at the high rating this film has at IMDb - - in the top 250 ? Really ? Based on a novella by Stephen King titled "" The Body "" ( hmmm , can't imagine why they changed the title for the movie ) , "" Stand by Me "" is one of those coming-of-age movies drenched in nostalgia for a more innocent time , set to period rock ' n roll tunes that makes for a better soundtrack than it does a movie . It's ably acted by a cast of young actors ( the late River Phoenix among them ) , and it's a solid effort overall , but it's not a movie that really spoke to me in any way or which I even really remember much all these years later . This movie did , however , trigger my repulsion for Kiefer Sutherland , which I nurture to this day .


Text2: Who Cares Who Killed Nolan ? Tom Nolan ( Sam Kydd ) , a small-time private detective , has been hired by Mrs . Arnoldson ( Ursula Howells ) to spy on her husband ( Griffith Jones ) , whom she suspects of having an affair . She is absolutely correct on that score . He is seeing the lovely Angela ( Nike Arrighi ) and plans on running off with her to the Bahamas . Nolan becomes suspicious of Mrs . Arnoldson ; something about her face strikes him as familiar . While taking photos of her at her country home , he is spotted by the Arnoldsons ' chauffeur ( Duncan Lamont ) , who gives chase and tries to shoot him . Fortunately for Nolan , a jogger happens to be passing , and he is able to make it back to his car . Terrified , Nolan calls on McGill for help . He refuses to disclose why he is running , he just wants Mac to help him flee the country . Mac returns from the bank ( where he had just cashed one of Nolan's cheques ) only to find the chauffeur in wait for him . Nolan is murdered , a crime for which McGill is framed . . . This is , to my mind , one of the worst episodes of the series . Donald Jonson ( who also wrote ' The Girl Who Never Was ' ) has come up with a plot that has more holes than a colander . Why does the chauffeur allow Nolan to escape so easily ? He could have shot the jogger in cold blood too . Nolan's terror is hard to fathom . You would think that he has just uncovered a ' Watergate ' style conspiracy , but no , its just a couple of old robbers hiding out . In the original series ' outline , Mac's first name was given as ' John ' - it was never used . In most episodes this was not a problem but here it is . The police issuing radio warnings about a ' murderer ' whose full name they do not know sounds comical . The Arnoldsons have pulled off an airport robbery and faked their own deaths . Mr . Arnoldson had sensibly undergone plastic surgery but his wife refused it ( which is how Nolan was able to recognise her ) . Presumably she liked the way she looked ? Her hiring of Nolan is daft behaviour coming from one supposed to be officially deceased . Sam Kydd and Ursula Howells are credited as guest stars , even though the former is only on screen for the first ten minutes , and the latter gets bumped off twenty minutes after that . Kydd was , of course , a familiar figure in British films and television series . When this was made , he was starring as ' Orlando ' in the I . T . V . children's ' series of the name . Howells went on to co-star with Patrick Cargill in the sitcom ' Father Dear Father ' . Also on view is a very young Trevor Peacock ( ' Jim ' from ' The Vicar Of Dibley ' ) as a ' lodger ' . Denise Buckley and Nike Arrighi both appeared in episodes of ' The Prisoner ' . If the taxi driver looks familiar , that's because he is played by Harold Goodwin , who was ' Foley ' in ' The Girl Who Never Was ' . It is impossible to imagine a middle-aged couple like the Arnoldsons committing a daring robbery . They look as if they would be more at home in the lounge of a Royal British Legion . So yes , this is absolute tosh , but watchable . Charles Crichton pulls off an impressive climax in the Arnoldsons ' house , with Mac creeping around in the dark , gun in hand . Very Hitchcockian scene , but spoilt slightly by Albert Elms ' intrusive incidental music .

146,"Text1: Perfect , dumb entertainment ! No one really wanted , or asked for , a sequel to the seriously stupid 1997 creature feature Anaconda . But it was a hit ( somehow ) and you know how studios are when it comes to milking something for all it's worth - yes , Halloween 9 is currently in pre-production ! Surprisingly , Anacondas is actually quite good for what it is . Originally meant to be a direct-to-video production , Sony was so impressed with the dailies that they more than doubled the budget and elevated it to a theatrical release . The budget constraints still cramp its style , compared to A-list studio stuff , but it's the best film it possibly can be . With a touch more plot , involving a search for an ultra-mega-massively rare flower , called the Blood Orchid , that only blooms every seven years and can unlock the secret to everlasting life , there is a sophistication to the script , rather than plain old slither'n'slash . So we have a bunch of scientists on an expedition to the unknown depths of the Borneo jungle and it's not off to a good start . They can only afford a ramshackle boat ; it's the rainy season and the rivers are mighty treacherous . Also , their boat captain ( Johnny Messner ) is a gruff ex-Special Forces American , with the cutest pet monkey ever . Everyone seems to be okay about their perilous quest until they are attacked by big crocs , go over a waterfall and become shipwrecked . Then , when things can't get any worse , one of them is gobbled up by - you've guessed it - an anaconda . Instead of the traditional one-by-one deaths story , like the first film , there is more conflict and interaction . These characters may not be the best , or the most well written , but the actors do what they can with what they've been given . Messner is especially good , keeping a cool head as snakes prey upon them from every shadow . J-Low-IQ , the hammy John Voight and Ice Cube may be gone ( there is a quick reference to them ) , but fellow Boyz N The Hood alumni Morris Chestnut and E . R . star Salli Richardson are offered up as potential reptile food . And it just so happens that it's mating season . And the snakes are all up for a big orgy . And guess where the Blood Orchids are ? Right above their shagging pit . Oh bloody hell ! Luis Llosa made Anaconda in the most simplistic and static way possible . This time Dwight H . Little , the very man who gave us Halloween 4 , the epic Steven Seagal movie Marked For Death and err . . . Free Willy 2 , brings strong direction and integrity . It's a darker , more complex film that seriously promises to deliver the goods , but comes up a bit short . If it had been taken a few steps further , then it would have been great . As it is , it's more atmospheric and professional , but still , a bleaker ending , with more gobbled-up characters , would have suited me better . The snakes themselves look okay , nothing special . Little keeps them hidden for as long as possible , only offering brief glimpses here and there . A snake is an awkward looking villain , so keeping it hidden is probably wiser . There is also , thank heavens , no dodgy animatronics . Incredibly dumb and unnecessary it may be , but Anacondas is easy , inoffensive entertainment that will surely appeal to some part of everybody's taste .


Text2: Muriel's Wedding was a fine early showcase of Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths Just saw this Australian dramady , about a heavyset woman dreaming of a wedding in order to improve her self-esteem , for the second time with my parents . My mom , a big ABBA fan , loved the music but wasn't too crazy about the movie which possibly had a little too much sex talk for her tastes . Dad was amused by many of those scenes and half-quoted some of those lines . Besides the wonderful songs from the international Swedish quartet , there's the very compelling performances of Toni Collette in the title role and Rachel Griffiths as her best friend Rhonda . Their seriously flawed characters ( Muriel steals things and lies constantly , Rhonda frequently smokes even after being diagnosed with cancer ) nevertheless compel empathy because of their mix of stubbornness , honesty-when chips are down , and loyalty to each other . Many of the supporting characters , mainly Muriel's siblings and other "" friends "" , seem one-sided but others , like Muriel's no longer happy parents and the South African athlete she marries for convenience , have some depth to them . P . J . Hogan , later to helm the Julia Roberts hit My Best Friends Wedding , wrote and directed a pretty humorous and unsentimental depiction of being single and trying to grow up despite your surroundings . So on that note , I highly recommend Muriel's Wedding .

"" I'm pretty sure that "" Lenny "" was a financial bomb , and I'm not surprised . It's a relentlessly depressing and ugly film , despite the stylish polish Fosse gives it . Anyone who has seen Fosse's last film , "" Star 80 , "" knows just how nihilistic this director could be , and "" Lenny "" shows evidence of that . It is a fascinating film though , in its own way . Fosse uses a documentary-like approach , complete with black and white photography and a narrative device in which we see Bruce's long-suffering love ( played heartbreakingly by Valerie Perrine , Lex Luthor's bikini-clad girlfriend in "" Superman "" [ 1978 ] ) telling Bruce's story to a filmmaker while the actual events themselves are played out as flashbacks . Fosse was fond of this confessional type of storytelling and would use it again in "" All That Jazz "" ( 1979 ) . Dustin Hoffman is simply sensational as Bruce ; he utterly disappears into this caustic character until no trace of Hoffman the actor is left . Technically , everything about the film is highly accomplished , but it's so desolately grim as to be off putting .


Text2: Fun , If Missing the Mel Brooks Touch I thought the stage musical adapted from Mel Brooks ' classic 1968 film was terrific and if anything even more outrageous than the movie . So it's strange that this movie based on the musical should feel so tame by comparison . It doesn't have that bawdy , let's offend everyone sense of fun that Brooks projects usually have , and it all feels a little lacklustre . Still , if you like the stage version , you'll probably have fun with this movie , as it's a virtual recreation , and the music sounds great . What I appreciate most about this movie is its willingness to be an old-fashioned movie musical . Unlike "" Chicago , "" which felt the need to justify all of its musical numbers as fantasy sequences taking place in the mind of a principal character , "" The Producers "" has people just breaking spontaneously into song , no apologies . If you're going to watch it , you have to accept that people are going to sing and dance and get on with it . And since most of the people in the film performed in the original Broadway cast , the songs are sung and danced well . Will Ferrell is new to the material , but he equips himself nicely as neo-Nazi Franz Liebkind and brings a lot of energy to his scenes . I would love to report that Uma Thurman stops the show as Ulla , the Swedish bombshell , but she doesn't . Uma , God love her , doesn't have the chops or the dancing skills to put over Ulla's big number , though the film makers do use her height to humorous advantage . I love the original film , but I don't worship it like some others , so I'm not as averse to playing with the material , and I didn't feel the need to compare Nathan Lane's and Matthew Broderick's performances to those of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder . They don't really reinterpret the material as much as recreate it , but that's o . k . We're not talking about doing a Eugene O'Neill revival here , and Brooks's material has only so much depth to mine . This movie is a fun way to pass a couple of hours . It's never boring , and it was wringing plenty of laughs from the audience I saw it with .

For "" Dragnet "" s initial attempt at doing a holiday episode , however , they focused on a tragedy . First done on radio taking place on the date that was also the name of the broadcast day-December 22 which was the airdate in 1949 - "" The Big . 22 Rifle for Christmas "" was later filmed for the second television season before airing on December 18 , 1952 . In both , Joe Friday ( Jack Webb ) and his partner ( Barton Yarborough as Ben Romero on radio , Herb Ellis as Frank Smith on TV ) investigate a missing child with blood residue and a bullet being the clues in his backyard . Another child who he played with is also later missing . I'll stop there and say besides Webb the other performer who appeared in both the radio and TV version here was William Johnstone as one of the boys ' father . ( Interesting note : His surname was Morheim on radio and Martin on TV . ) Both versions were compellingly presented but there were some noticeable differences . Like on radio , the partner talked to one of the boys while here it's Friday meaning Ellis doesn't do much here . There's also one visual addition : as Johnstone slams his door , a Christmas ornament from a wreath falls and breaks . Most chilling in both versions is the last line from Joe : "" Don't get a kid a gun for Christmas . "" I'm sure even the N . R . A can't disagree on that ! With that said , "" The Big . 22 Rifle for Christmas "" episode of Dragnet explores just how traumatic childhood tragedy can really be though at least here some forgiveness is visited to the parties involved . . .

Text2: The Long Night is a nearly excellent , if obscure , movie I recently discovered When I went to my local library to check some DVDs , I stumbled onto this obscure flick that starred Henry Fonda , Barbara Bel Geddes ( in her film debut ) , Vincent Price , and Ann Dvorak . With that cast ( I just remembered that Elisa Cook , Jr . has a memorable role as a blind man here ) , with Anatole Litvak as director , and Dimitri Tiomkin conducting his score ( as well as some Beethoven pieces spread among it ) , I expected an excellent suspenseful movie and I got it ! Well , maybe nearly so since the speech Ms . Bel Geddes says to Fonda at the end is obviously contrived to address the audience as well as the leading character about the faith of people . Otherwise , the dialogue was mostly spot-on especially the heated exchanges between Fonda and Price who , as usual , is absolutely charming even in his creepiness . And Ms . Dvorak marks a nice contrast with her cynicism as compared with Ms . Bel Geddes ' optimism . Fonda himself goes the full range of emotions whether during the flashbacks or his present condition of being holed up in his apartment while the police are waiting outside . So for all that , I highly recommend The Long Night .

Even the book was a slow read ; but some major elements of the novel and lead characters were totally reworked for the movie and King's intent is by the wayside . A UFO crash lands in the forest guarding Haven , Maine and the impact burrows the craft into the ground . Eminent vibrations from the alien craft has citizens creating mechanical gadgets for no good reason , while some of the inhabitants just disappear or gravitate to the dig site trying to unearth the alien ship . Jimmy Smits seems out of place playing the alcoholic writer and eventual hero . His awkward performance still out shines the rest of the cast except for Marg Helgenberger . She is very easy on the eye and plays her character flawlessly . Former porn star Traci Lords still needs a lot of work to move into mainstream movies . Her part was played over the top and becomes quite irritating . Not as abrasive as Allyce Beasley and Robert Carradine . Cliff De Young plays the cheating husband effortlessly . Joanna Cassidy and E . G . Marshall round out the diverse cast . The special effects , namely the aliens buried in the craft are pretty top notch for a made-for-TV project . Stephen King is my favorite writer and I do have to agree with those that think Tommyknockers is no where near his better work .

The arrangement of marriage could lead to quite a fortune if the false Percival can get Laurie to sign a document turning over her assets to his name . Marion , Laurie's confidant and adviser , however , will always be a thorn in the false Percival's side . Also , weighing on the false Percival's mind is the mother of the real Percival's child , a woman bound in a private asylum , ran by the slimy director Dr . Isidor Fosco ( Hay Petrie ; playing him as a sly scoundrel , almost as devious a character as the false Percival ) . He'll have to be rid of the mother , Mrs . Catherick ( Elsie Wagstaff ) and somehow get rid of a nagging nuisance that develops . . the real Percival's daughter , the "" woman in white "" Anne Catherick ( also played by Sylvia Marriott ) escapes from the asylum in an unfortunate mishap and begins raising havoc informing Paul that the false Percival only wishes to marry Laurie for her money . And , he has ANOTHER problem he'll have to deal with , a lovely servant girl he soon makes a chambermaid . . she's pregnant with the false Percival's child and wants to marry him herself . He contends with all this drama while being blackmailed by Fosco who will keep his lips sealed if the false Percival feeds his pockets with a large sum . Together , the false Percival and Fosco etch out a plan . . because Laurie and Anne look almost identical , they could let Anne die of the pneumonia she contacts being out in the open too long and switch her body with Laurie's . They'd lock Laurie away in the asylum with everyone believing her dead using the corpse of Anne as the disguise . Through and through , however , Paul and Marion will not easily sit on their hands when they know deep down inside that the false Percival is indeed not who he he says he is . And , it's only a matter of time before the relationship between two scoundrels , Foscoe and the false Percival will deteriorate . Marvelously twisted black comedy is played with such relish and glee , the flick is intoxicatingly entertaining . . if the material suits your tastes . The false Percival , played with such demented joy by a great Tod Slaughter , who cackles with widened eyes as he strangles innocents unfortunate enough to meet him late at night at an isolated boat house . The film is also startlingly adult presenting some pretty disturbing material played to the hilt . I mean , in the opening scene , Slaughter kills the real Percival with hammered stake to the temple of his skull ! Despite watching a bad quality print ( this terrific film deserves a pristine copy if ever a film deserves one ) , the film's still atmospherically rich with a very noirish , Gothic , decadent beauty . A must-see for fans of macabre comedies . Not for all tastes .

151,"Text1: A Nutshell Review : Once Were Warriors When the opening credits screamed huge titles in your face , I thought that this was going to be one of those Grindhouse styled pictures with cheesy hilarious dialogues with over the top acting and swear words flying all over . In fact , the first few minutes established all that coupled with a very edgy score , but Grindhouse this is not , instead , it has all the trappings of a solid drama , and deals with very mature adult themes and of family . This is a very different New Zealand that someone from the outside will take to . Gone are the picturesque postcard scenes , and in are the gritty , grimy neighbourhoods where families at the poverty line struggle to make a living . The story , based upon a novel by Alan Duff , centers on the Heke family , who are of Maori descent . And things are rosy at home as Mom Beth ( Rena Owen ) has 5 kids to take care of , in which Boogie ( Taungaroa Emile ) is going to be sentenced in juvenile court , and eldest Nig ( Julian Arahanga ) seeking a home away from home with gangs . The only and possibly sensible one is with Grace ( Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell ) , who assists her mom in shepherding her youngest siblings from the explosive behavior of father Jake ( Temuera Morrison ) who has a penchant for violence when he has too much to drink . Sounds like a typical family melodrama all set up , and it is , except that this was delivered with such realism that you'll cringe at the sight of unflinching violence . It's hard to sit through it , leaving you seething with rage as the victims find it difficult to leave and make changes to their lives . Once Were Warriors chronicles this struggle , and your emotions go on a roller coaster as you root for various characters to break out of their zone of discomfort , and to challenge the norms in order to stand up for themselves . The first time Jake rages in the movie undoubtedly sets the tone for the rest of the story , because slivers of hope get evaporated by the time you see how the make up artists work on Beth to bring to you the sheer madness . The character of Jake is peculiarly intriguing , as for someone who got laid off and without a job , he's satisfied to just be on welfare , and what more , to spend those money on drink and gambling , though drawing the line on women . After hours late night parties at his home with his "" pals "" also seem the norm to sooth his ego as being the all round nice guy . And when things don't go his way , the only way he knows how to deal with it , is by his fists , where he takes pride in dispatching trouble makers in bars , unknowing that he too is trouble for his own family . Quite a tragic character really , for his clueless behaviour in not knowing how to take care of his family properly , being constantly disengaged from his wife and children , which naturally awaited for some tragedy to happen . On the other hand , one can only imagine the amount of abuse that wife Beth can put up with , if not only for the sake of the children . It's interesting to see where the leads have gone off to after this 1994 movie . Temuera Morrison looked familiar , and a quick check on IMDb showed that he had portrayed Jango Fett and Commander Cody in the fairly recent Star Wars prequels . In fact , co-lead Rena Owen too had starred in the prequels as well . Director Lee Tamahori doesn't lag behind too , having helmed the James Bond installment Die Another Day , and xXx2 . Once Were Warriors had a sequel as well called What Becomes of The Broken Hearted ? which was also made into a movie , though was less well received . Personally , this is rated by me as a highly recommended movie , and watching a Haka being performed here , definitely deserved its brownie points .


Text2: Uneventful Trash I only saw this film because my girlfriend wanted to and I did try hard to enjoy it but it sucked big time . There are so many plot holes and hard to swallow plot elements . For example are we really supposed to believe that Kim Basinger is the sister of someone who is about 24 years younger than her ? What on earth was that evil nanny supposed to be ? What was the point in taking Cody to the dentist ? And why did this film build up to such an unsatisfying climax ? For a film that tried to draw its power from supernatural hokum the ending was spectacularly ordinary . The acting was exceptionally poor throughout and I am very surprised that Chuck Russell churned out such a piece of manufactured garbage . If you take equal parts of Rosemary's Baby , Devil's Advocate , End of Days and that awful Winona Ryder film Lost Souls , mix it up with a large dose of badly recorded ADR ( 99 % of the film's dialogue ) and you have this film . It might have been better if Christina Ricci had been in it more . I swear , she must have been in it for about 5 minutes absolute max .

153,"Text1: James Stewart and His Giant Bunny Are Absolutely Charming James Stewart plays gentle soul Elwood P . Dowd in this charming , benevolent comedy spiced with hints of fantasy . Elwood is an eccentric man who consorts with an invisible 6 foot tall ( or 6 ' 3 "" tall , to be exact ) rabbit named Harvey , much to the dismay of his sister and niece . They spend much of the film trying to have him committed to an institution so that he'll stop being an embarrassment to them , but their plans don't work , mostly because everyone with whom Elwood comes in contact is utterly beguiled by him . Elwood isn't "" normal "" like all of the other characters in the movie , meaning he's not uptight , cruel and worried about what others think of him . The movie asks its audience : would you rather be like Elwood or would you rather be "" normal "" ? Give me a giant invisible rabbit any day over the fussy characters with whom Elwood has to contend . It would be easy to dismiss Stewart's performance as too easy for him , as many critics did at the time of the film's release . But not just anyone could have played this character and made it work . Whether or not Stewart is acting the part well or is just being Jimmy Stewart in a well-matched role doesn't really matter , as the result is the same . He has a tremendous screen presence and carries the film , even though he's off-screen for much of it . "" Harvey "" is a sweet movie with a distinct strain of melancholia running through it . It's more about the way one wishes the world could be rather than the way it actually is .


Text2: The Film May Be Gloomy , But It's Not Depressing Movies about literary people too often sound like books rather than movies . The way characters talk doesn't jive with the way people actually sound in real life . Dialogue sounds scripted , phrases and speeches are too well put together . This is a trap "" Starting Out in the Evening "" doesn't avoid , but it's easy to overlook that minor flaw , as the rest of the film is intelligent and thoughtful . The main reason to watch is Frank Langella , playing Leonard Schiller , an aging novelist who the world has forgotten and who is tempted to hope that his name might be revived by an idolatrous grad student who wants to do her thesis on his work . The grad student ( Lauren Ambrose ) is pushy and rather unlikable , but it makes sense that Leonard would take to her , as only someone as pushy as she could break through his reclusive facade . The relationship these two embark upon is complicated to say the least , and both actors navigate the tricky terrain well . A subplot involves Leonard's daughter ( played by Lili Taylor , who it was a pleasure to see again ) and her rekindled relationship with a man of whom Leonard does not approve ( Adrian Lester ) . "" Starting Out in the Evening "" is one of those ultra-sombre movies that takes place in the dead of winter , when everything is cold and dead , and in which the predominant color scheme is brown and gray . But the cast brings enough vitality to the film , and the screenplay is unpredictable enough , that the end product is engaging rather than depressing .

155,"Text1: This is the best boxing film that's not really a boxing film since Rocky . There is no role that Denzel Washington fits more perfectly in than the kind he played in racially charged atmosphere in The Hurricane . When he and that poor kid John Artis were pulled over and the officer said that they were looking for two negroes in a white car , no actor could have been better than Denzel when he said , "" Any two will do ? "" What a perfect piece of casting , and Denzel Washington was startlingly convincing as the legendary Rubin Carter throughout the entire film . Every actor performed amazingly , even Liev Schrieber , who makes a smart turn after all of his obnoxious performances in the Scream trilogy . However , I have to say that I did get a little bit tired of watching Vicellous Reon Shannon mumble through his lines as the determined Lesra Martin , but besides his slightly botched dialogue he also contributed an important element of innocence and wonder to the film . The Hurricane is a nearly flawlessly photographed film . Every scene has such perfect cinematography that you forget that you're watching a movie , you're actually THERE . This was especially important in the many prison scenes , particularly when Carter was in "" the hole "" for refusing to wear prison clothes , where his fall into temporary insanity was creatively and amazingly portrayed . I've seen people go insane in a huge number of movies ( Hilary and Jackie ( 1998 ) , Shine ( 1996 ) , Little Voice ( 1999 ) , and even Little Man Tate ( 1991 ) ) , but I've never seen the editing used to make a character seem that he was actually having a conversation with himself . Excellent piece of filmmaking right there . The time periods were portrayed perfectly , the costumes were designed to fit not only the time period but also each specific actor , and the dialogue was absolutely engrossing in every scene . This was an absolutely incredible film . It moves the audience just as much as even the most emotionally intense films , and it is a great film to enjoy and learn from at the same time . Unfortunately , there were a few fairly important things that were left out that just should not have been . ( spoilers ) For example , we never find out what happened to Carter's wife . Sure , it's easy to assume that she divorced him , but after the scene when she visits him and he tells her that he's going to die in prison , we never see or hear from her or about her again . Also , nothing really came of the strong threats that Terry ( John Hannah ) , Lisa ( Deborah Unger ) , Sam ( Liev Schrieber ) , and Lesra ( Vicellous Shannon ) received from Detective Vincent Pesca ( Dan Hedaya ) on the street corner that day except for one time when their brakes were evidently disabled . Sure , that's a pretty vicious thing to do , but when he approached the four of them he seemed pretty determined to stop their investigation at all costs . The last thing that I think should be noted ( as well as the most important ) , is that at the end of the film , nothing ever came of the heinous crimes that were committed against Rubin Carter . None of the people who falsely imprisoned him ( especially Det . Pesca , who had falsely imprisoned Carter for most of his life ) were ever reprimanded for their negligence to uphold the law . At the same time , however , this can be seen as a very respectable element of the film , because it suggests that the movie is about the tremendous strength of the human spirit in the face of hopeless circumstances , and that it is NOT about revenge . This is the kind of thing that you get from films that are somehow able to avoid the poisonous influences of Hollywood , and they are often not easily accepted because people don't look at the actual meaning of things like this , they just want a perfectly happy ending . The Hurricane is an example of a film in which you have to look at what the ending MEANS , not just the basic way that it happened . This same is true for other great films like Boys Don't Cry ( 1999 ) and Life Is Beautiful ( 1997 ) . The emphasis is not on happy endings , but instead on being

Text2: Lee's best performance as Dracula ? In the past , I've accused Jess Franco of losing focus about 10 minutes into his films . It's not unusual to see him stray from his subject for a few unnecessary close-ups of any random object or to include several minutes of what appears to be vacation footage he shot out of the window of a car . That's certainly not the case with Franco's Count Dracula . By Franco's standards , it's a very straight forward story . There are a number of other things to like about the movie . Excusing the Spain for England locations , the sets are wonderfully Spartan and very atmospheric . Bruno Nicolai's score is about as good as you'll find in any of Franco's efforts . But the highlight is the acting . Franco assembled one of the most acclaimed casts he ever worked with . Klaus Kinski , Herbert Lom , and Christopher Lee give the film immediate credibility . Lee's performance is the real standout . Of the numerous times he played Dracula , his work in Count Dracula just might be the best of his career . The supporting players , featuring the usual group of Franco regulars , give some of their best performances . But it's this straight forward approach used by Franco that contributes to the films downfall . Franco was attempting to film a fairly faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel ( it was the only way he could get Lee to agree to play Dracula ) . And while he may have actually been more successful along that line than some of the other , better known Dracula films , unfortunately the end result is incredibly dull and lifeless . While the film gets off to a good start with Jonathan Harker's visit to Dracula's castle , things grind to a halt once Dracula reaches England . So even though Count Dracula may represent one of Franco's most competently directed films , the boredom factor is too high to rate the movie anything better than average .

Kevin Smith hasn't evolved at all as a filmmaker in the past 12 years , but who really cares ? No one's going to ever nominate him for an Oscar or anything , and , Jersey Girl aside , his films are entertaining . Sometimes they're downright hilarious . I forgot just how fun the guy can be . Clerks II is probably my second favorite of his films after the original . It goes back to his old characters , Dante and Randall , who , after the Quick Stop burned down , started working at a fast food restaurant . Dante finally found the perfect woman , or at least one who will bring him opportunities and relative happiness . His dream girl is his manager ( Rosario Dawson ) , but he doesn't believe they could ever have a future together . The mushy stuff works okay , especially the friendship between Dante and Randall . This movie is played almost wholly for laughs . And there are a lot of big ones . I love their co-worker , Elias ( Trevor Fehrman ) , a 19 year-old born again Christian who lives most of his life talking about either The Transformers or Lord of the Rings . I laughed pretty much constantly at him . The only big disappointment is the climactic Tijuana donkey show , which is built up and then turns out really lame . And it's not because Smith was too Puritan about it , either . It's pretty dirty and I'm actually wondering how the MPAA let it go with an R rating ( I'm wondering if it was originally way worse , and then with a bit of editing seemed relatively tame ) . It's just not that funny . One thing is for sure : it's almost impossible to watch this movie without falling in love with Rosario Dawson . I've seen her elsewhere , but she's never made an impression . She's just out-and-out sexy here , even in a fast food uniform . It wouldn't surprised me if Smith's wife left him just for how lovingly he films her . The film is juvenile , but definitely one of my favorite movies so far in 2006 . Highly recommended to anyone who liked or loved the original .

He's especially good in the early segment as the uneducated kid who comes under the tutoring of BRIAN KEITH as Jonas Cord . The swamp scenes , where McQueen gets himself sent to prison so he can locate Arthur Kennedy , almost seem like segments from another movie he made with Dustin Hoffman - - PAPILLON .

157,"Text1: In desperate need of restoration . We should start a charity fund . It has grown mythic in my mind since several Europeans that I talkto on the internet began to tell me many months ago that Chimesat Midnight was an Orson Welles film that they preferred even toCitizen Kane . Yet it was unavailable in the US , and I thought that Iwould never see it . But finally I found a copy at a local alternativevideo store . I must say , to suggest that it beats Kane is giving it more creditthan it deserves . That film is today generally considered the verybest ever made ( on my own list , the latest version , it lands at # 12 ) , though that status was hard fought over those who overrate thecastrated version of The Magnificent Ambersons , though that filmis indeed , too , a masterpiece in its own right . But Chimes atMidnight is itself also a small masterpiece . Considering howcheaply it seems to have been made , the results are jaw - dropping . It is among Welles best , though saying that is asredundant as saying a play is ranked highly in Shakespeare'scanon . I have to confess to not knowing much about which Shakespeareplays Welles was using ; I don't have the necessary research toolsas I write this . I believe that he used a mixture of several plays , butnothing in the film seemed familiar to me , who have read only aquarter of them . Whatever Welles did , though , the results areamazing . His direction and editing give the film an enormouskinetic energy . The famous battle scene , the centerpiece of thefilm , ranks among the best ever created on film ( I would saycaptured , but Welles , presumably on account of the low cost ofproduction , creates the tension and fury of it by editing mostly , notcinematography or complex direction ) . Welles the actor is at thepeak of his form , though that is redundant , too . Did Welles evergive a bad performance ? I haven't seen too many outside of hisown directorial efforts , but the few I have seen I must concedewere beyond excellent . One other mention of acting : what the hellhappened to Jeanne Moreau ? Was Orson Welles stealing hermeals ? For Christ's sake , she looks like she's dying . I've seen six of the , what , ten or eleven films that Welles directed . Five of those I've given a , including Falstaff . Only Macbeth , which I felt paid too much attention to the technical aspects andnot enough to the actual play ( although it was only the secondWelles film I saw and that was a while back ) , I have given lessthan that , a . Falstaff I rank fifth out of the remaining five ( inorder : Citizen Kane , Touch of Evil , The Trial , The MagnificentAmbersons ) . Perhaps I would rank it as highly as my Europeanfriends do , but there is one issue that may be destroying itsbrilliance : the tape that I rented was in the most awful condition . Generally , my credo is that I won't watch a direct cinematicadaptation of a Shakespeare play unless I have read the original , but lately I have noticed that I can understand his dialogue quitesufficiently . However , as Shakespeare is difficult to comprehend byear alone , imagine hearing Shakespearean dialogue spoken byCharlie Brown's teacher ! As the print I saw was terrible , voices aresometimes impossible to understand . I think I only caught around of the dialogue , which made the plot somewhat difficult tofollow . The picture's contrast was quite bad , too , but notunbearable . The sound was definitely the biggest wound the filmhas received . But as films are being restored every day , andWelles's importance has never been denied , we must pray thatthis one is on someone's agenda . I pray for a Criterion edition witha great commentary track on the side that can decipher everythingI'll miss .

The plot centers on Holly Martin ( Joseph Cotten ) learning of his friend's ( Orson Welles ) death in Vienna , meeting various and sundry strange people , and getting a big surprise at the end . Probably the movie's strongest aspect is the zither music . You can feel it moving the film along , almost as much as the mysterious setting does . But when they set up the trick at the end , it's especially neat how they set it up ! Even if you know what's going to happen , you still have to admire what they did .

For starters , Sylvestor Stallone as Lt . Marion "" Cobra "" Cobretti has to be one of the single most slimy and hateful would-be "" heroes "" to ever ooze his scummy way across the screen : With his three day stubble , tight jeans , long black overcoat , mirror shades , leather gloves and penchant for chewing on unlit matchsticks , Cobra exudes all the appeal and charisma of a damp sewer rat . He's also crass , vicious and morally reprehensible , the kind of vile he-man who strictly adheres to a crude "" might makes right "" mentality and uses excessive brute force as often as possible . Reni Santoni grumbles and mumbles his way into our hearts as Cobra's endearingly grubby junk food junkie partner Gonzales . Brian Thompson snarls , sneers and spits for all it's worth as the deranged head villain ( Thompson's delirious climactic speech towards the end is uproarious ; he keeps using the word "" pig "" until it becomes some sort of maniacal mantra ) . The cult of crazed lunatics terrorizing the city are a total campy hoot : For some inexplicable reason they engage in this bizarre ritual in which they clink axes over their heads . Some of them wear filthy t-shirts and dirty jeans ; others are dressed in suits . The cult appears to be made up of a diverse cross section of insane folks who are brought together by their mutual love for unhinged psychotic violence . In addition , they want to blithely butcher all us nice law-abiding average weaklings in order to make way for some new world order of gleefully nihilistic murderous barbarians . Ahh , ain't that sweet ? The gorgeously statuesque Brigitte Nielson at least looks properly stunning as a lovely aspiring model the wackos target for annihilation . Considering that Brigitte is six feet tall and built like a Buick , the scenes of her running away in stark fear from the nuts are absolutely gut-busting . She could have easily taken out at least a dozen of these freaks by delivering roundhouse kicks to their groins with her incredibly long legs , but I guess I'm digressing here . Val Avery as a huffy police chief , Art La Fleur as an irate captain , and especially Andrew Robinson as a sniveling by-the-book geeky wimp mostly just stand around and voice their disapproval of Cobra's wildly unorthodox methods . Director George P . Cosmatos tackles the ridiculous premise with a slick punchy'n'polished hopped-up style as if he was making high art ; there's a few alarmingly atrocious music montage sequences set to horrible head-banging hair band rock songs .

The amazing opening grocery store massacre set piece proudly has product placements for such items as Pepsi and Coors beer .

In September 1971 , thieves tunneled into the vault of a bank in London's Baker Street and looted safe deposit boxes of cash and jewellry worth over three million pounds . None of it was recovered .

By forgetting her identity , she forgets that she's married to Vint and Thelma's daughter-in-law . Naomi spends time with Thelma and Iola who mold her more into their image instead of who she was before the accident . It's a typical amnesia episode in which a character forgets who they are for the episode . Naomi has to find her way back to reality from her memory loss and the episode is predictable if not typical in sitcoms at all . Naomi's personality changes from her bubbly self to somebody more fitting for Iola and Thelma than her own husband who she doesn't know and won't fool around with him like they usually do . One of the charms of this show is the general affection between Vint and Naomi .


Text2: One of Hollywood's legends ! To be honest , I never really cared much about James Dean . I never saw any of his films but I saw this one about his life . I became fascinated by it . In his short life , he became the rebel with a cause . Watching this film , I became very interested in him . It's too bad that we lost him so young and too soon . much like Marilyn Monroe , Elvis Presley . He became a bigger legend after his death . In reality , he led a very sad lonely life . I'm so glad that Michael Moriarty is back to acting . We do get to know James Dean as the person behind the persona much like Marilyn MOnroe and Elvis Presley . It's hard to imagine that James Dean only acted in a handful of films and has maintained a legendary status since his tragic premature death at a young age . You wished he lived to be an old man because we were robbed of him as the person before our eyes .

In this film based on the novel , he re-teams with Emma Thompson who plays the housekeeper and the woman who he loves but can't bear to mention . Emma gives a brilliant performance as the housekeeper who seeks marriage and family life . Their characters reunite many years later only to break my heart and cause me tears . The film is nothing less than spectacular . Christopher Reeve is in one of his last major film roles as the younger owner of the estate . Sadly , Reeve will become paralyzed in real life .

Dame Julie Andrews is brilliant as the postulate aspiring nun , Sister Maria , who is sent to help a local military man , Captain Von Trap , played by the brilliant Christopher Plummer to raise his seven children . At first , the children are resistant to Maria's unconventional ways . She makes an attempt to become the friend despite the oldest daughter who doesn't need a mother but does after all . Maria eases her way with the Von Trap children by teaching them how to sing and be children again . She gives them the play clothes made out of curtains or drapes from her bedroom quarters . They sing , play , and have picnics in the beautiful Salzburg mountains . Of course , Maria causes discourse in the Von Trapp family household but she manages to stay on and wins over the Captain Von Trap who was seeing a very beautiful Fraulein Schraeder from Vienna who is not crazy about children . Of course , this story takes place before the rise of Hitler and World War II . When Maria and the Captain come back from their honeymoon , they must face separation with Captain being ordered to serve the Third Reich despite his obvious disdain . The scenes at the Convent are also memorable especially with the late and wonderful Anna Lee MBE as one of the nuns . Again , the scenery , the art direction , the costumes , the music , the writing , and acting are all first rate .

Text2: Creepshow III Anthology horror with no direct link to the first two . It contains five tales all tied together in one way or another . You'll notice that Professor Dayton ( Emmett McGuire ) and his toys often play a heavy role in the outcome of certain characters in the film . The first has a father's new remote control creating a living nightmare for daughter Alice ( Stephanie Pettee ) . It seems that when her father presses the button , Alice is sent to an alternate parallel reality where her family is either black or Hispanic . . not to mention the fact that Alice is suffering through these severe skin mutations which increase every time her alternate father pushes a button on the remote . The second has lonely , alcoholic security officer Jerry ( AJ Bowen ) receiving a strange transmission from a radio he bought off a hobo street peddler nearby where he lives . . a sexy female voice , who sees his every move and begins controlling his life ! This voice will guide him into some hairy situations particularly murder ! The third regards Rachael ( Camille Lacey ) , the "" Call-Girl Killer "" , notorious for her series of knife murders to supposed male clients . Rachael believes she's about to collect another frat boy victim for her growing resume , but little does she know that Victor ( Ryan Carty ) isn't quite who he appears to be . . Jovial Professor Dayton ( you remember Dayton turning someone into a rabbit early on ) , a quantum engineer who often retreats reclusively to his lab working on "" THE experiment "" , is getting married and invites two former students he often played practical jokes on to meet his new fianc√© . They believe she is his new experiment , a robotic bride and partake in "" dismantling "" her . But , she might not be what they were expecting . . Rude Dr . Farwell ( Kris Allen ) , a foul , crude , pill-popping jerk serving off a sentence by doing free clinical work , is haunted by the spirit of a bum he gave a poisoned hot dog to ( . . which was actually meant for him ) ! He delivers bad news to patients with as little care as possible . Example , he informs a father that his daughter has a cancerous inoperable tumor ( with her hearing it for the first time in horror ) and tells him he might ought to take her to the senior prom one year early ! Now , this anthology isn't noteworthy or that well produced , but isn't , in my honest opinion , nearly as awful as many have said . Is it that great ? No , not really . But , I've seen much , much worse . And , at least some of the tales have amusing bits . I honestly believed the directors did what they could with limited means in order to provide Creepshow fans some cheesy enjoyment . I chuckled quite a bit , especially at how many of the characters made mistakes they lived to regret . Some stories I really found amusing , like the one with the two students and their Professor's wife or the one where humans receive orders from a radio . At least , these are somewhat original instead of plagiarized ideas blatantly ripped from others .

He portrays a dramatic art teacher - which he was in real life - and when he gives a piece of advice to his "" students "" - who are , ironically , already professionals : Odette Joyeux , Bernard Blier-the film always rings true , it's quite realistic . There are many sequences where the students perform scenes from classic playwrights - my favorite is the excerpt from "" taming of the shrew "" - and Jouvet's comments and critics are always insightful , as if it were cinema verite . But the scene in the laundry where Jouvet convinces Isabelle's aunt and uncle that their niece was born to play on stage is pure Jeanson : it's the famous moment when Jouvet explains to them that if he wears his Legion d'Honneur , it is to impress the morons . Opinions are divided over the "" true "" love affairs . Cecilia ( Odette Joyeux ) is a spoiled child who tries to take revenge on her ex-lover who has left her for Isabelle . The writers tried to connect the fictitious heroes to reality but it would take Marcel Carn√© and Jacques Pr√©vert to fully succeed in that task ( "" Les Enfants du Paradis "" ) . Just sit back and watch the great artist Jouvet at work . He makes all the scenes he's not in almost mediocre by comparison .

165,"Text1: A Nutshell Review : Snakes on a Plane For the record , I hate snakes , and have this phobia of snakes . I can even freeze in my tracks at a bloody picture . And it goes without saying that the Snake House is never a place I'll visit in any zoo . What's my fear about ? I don't know , just that I attach this sense of evilness and danger to these slimy ( yes I know they're not ) slithery creatures that should be condemned to the depths of hell . Anyway I digress . What compelled me to watch this picture , besides the fact that I'm a sucker for punishment , is Samuel L Jackson . He's THE man ! With Sam , you'll always know he'll lift that scene or two , oozing street charisma and attitude like none other . This is a cheesy movie done in a cheesy way but with A list production values , tons of special effects , animal trainers , and yes , plenty of snakes of all shapes and sizes . From pythons to the cobras to the rattlers , I tell you these creatures will chill you at your seats . Thank goodness this ain't on no IMAX or 3D effect , otherwise I suspect many will be reeling their heads backwards , and backwards some more . The plot's none too cerebral to begin with , so don't bother but accept , go on board , and enjoy the fright , I mean flight . It isn't going all out to scare you , though watching characterless caricatures suffer and die under the most sickening conditions involving all conceivable snake-accessible orifices and sexual appendages , provides some sort of sick pleasure . The usual clich√©s of thrillers / horrors are milked here as well , like the well used one that those who have sex are usually the first to go . And there are plenty of victims from where that came from , given the movie's set on a red eye flight in a Boeing jet , offering a variety of passengers like the rap star and his posse , kids travelling alone for the first time , dumb blondes , the Asian Kung Fu master , and even the cabin crew , who are put in a better light as compared to another set-on-a-plane movie Flightplan . If there should be a gripe , then it's the length of the action sequences , most of which are just too short , or unexplained , especially those involving Jackson . I mean , the audience should see how he goes around killing those SOBs , but as mentioned , we don't get to see much . I suspect some scenes will probably end up in an extended DVD version , deleted scenes , or perhaps make their way into video games , fighting his way through with makeshift weapons . That aside , and if you're OK with the censored bit in this NC-16 movie where a couple joins the mile high club ( too bad it's forcibly shortened ) , Snakes on a Plane is a movie to catch on the big screen for the fun factor , and no , you'll definitely not get to watch this on any inflight entertainment system anytime soon . The Cobra Starship music video for the movie plays through the end credits . Not too bad a song , think it's becoming a ear worm for me .


Text2: A Nutshell Review : Lars and the Real Girl I'd bet almost everyone during their childhood years would have interacted with their toys somehow , be it outwardly verbal , or playing it all in the mind . Conversations with dolls , teddy bears , or even with G . I . Joe himself beating up Cobra Commander , these are stuff of what a rich imagination would be made of , breathing a form of consciousness onto inanimate objects . Some kids don't grow up of course , retaining their childlike mannerisms within a grown up body . Ryan Gosling's Lars is a gentle , soft-spoken man , extremely shy but ever ready with a warm smile that can melt the sternest of hearts , and when nervous or anxious , blinks hard . Living in the garage ( by choice ) of a house occupied by brother Gus ( Paul Schneider ) and his wife Karin ( Emily Mortimer ) , we learn that Lars has a condition of being delusional , and his extreme introversion causes him to absolutely abhor signs of affection . It's been a while since I remembered a movie having a central character spending much time interacting with an object , the most memorable of course would be Tom Hanks ' Chuck Noland being castaway on an island and finding companionship with Wilson the volleyball . Here , Lars finds a new security blanket in his mail order sex doll he christians Bianca , which is highly customizable , anatomically correct , and quite attractive to boot . Furthermore , it's not just one character that gets all emotional with it , in fact , the entire small midwestern town does , where everybody indulges Lars and his new friend , at first to curious stares , but slowly warming up to even Bianca as well , as their tender reactions now turn into immense efforts bringing Lars out of the shell . And would you believe that the director for Mr . Woodcock helmed this movie ? I suppose one would have imagined that with a plot device like a sex doll , it will be extremely easy to traverse down the path of comedy . However , Lars and the Real Girl avoided that with a ten foot pole , being contemplative , and for the most parts , surprisingly quiet . It's a sublimely warmhearted movie about community , love , and relationships forged under trying circumstances . It's unconventional in its approach to conventional themes , and therein lies its wonderful charm with a pinch of quirkiness . Those who have enjoyed Ryan Gosling's performance in Half Nelson will find that he's again in fine form , and personally I felt he did much better here . He brings out the innocence of Lars succinctly , and his performance will without a doubt touch many with his earnestness in being a Boo Radley without ill-intentions to people around him , and wanting to be left alone doing his own thing . It might seem like a one man show again , but the supporting casts are given ample opportunity to shine and complement Gosling , with Emily Mortimer being the ever supportive pillar of strength in the household , juggling all the weirdness with her pregnancy , and Paul Schneider the opposite , a skeptic who feels responsible and remorseful for Lars ' condition . Patricia Clarkson and Kelli Garner play the other women in Lars ' life , the former the psychologist treating his condition , and the latter a co-worker who's equally shy in expressing her true feelings for this man-child . The power of the mind and imagination , to say that it's powerful would be a gross understatement , and to witness how honest emotions get to conquer mental conditions , is indeed a joy to behold . Lars and the Real Girl succeeds in being mature about the treatment , and having a great cast deliver the goods superbly , is already a major plus . Should you not want to sit through another teenage sex-romp comedy like Superbad , then let not the notion of having a sex-doll on screen turn you away , as you'll be pleasantly surprised by the end results . Recommended ! P . S . Like Knocked Up which featured a real site in Mr Skin , those smitten with Bianca will be happy to know the site featured in the movie is real too , though a standard real doll will set you back by about US$7K no less . As I know I have readers in their teens , I will not be adding actual links to the websites mentioned here .

The first , ' A Second Chance ' stars Ed Begley Jr . as a young man who finds that his newly purchased antique car can travel in time . It's an interesting little tale reminiscent of The Twilight Zone , but it doesn't really have any place in a supposed horror film ( even one that was made for TV . The middle tale , ' no such thing as a vampire ' , stars Patrick Macnee as Dr . Gheria , a wealthy British man whose wife believe that she's been the victim of a vampire . Gheria naturally doesn't believe this preposterous notion at first , then Micheal comes to help . . . . This tale was better than the first one , but even though it is enjoyable enough and boosts a nice twist , it's still nothing that special . Which brings as to the third , last & hands down best story in this movie , "" Bobby "" , in which a long deceased boy is brought back to life via the dark magiks that his distressed , grief-stricken mother partakes in . She's jubilant to find him at her door , but things soon turn sour as he's different now & playing sadistic games with mommy dearest . For all the horror and tension that the first two stories lacked , this one makes up for it . . . . in spades .

Text2: I shutter to think ! D . W . Griffith remains well-known for a handful of feature-length silent films he directed . It's less well-known that he churned out a large number of much shorter films as well , ranging in tone and quality from crude comedies to sophisticated mini-dramas . I found ' The House with Closed Shutters ' hugely interesting for the performances of the actors . This film may well be the best surviving record of 19th-century stage-acting techniques . Griffith's background was in the theatre ; when this movie was made , many Victorian actors were still performing . In this film , the actors largely seem to be using theatrical stage techniques , rather than a more natural film technique or the elaborately overwrought histrionics which modern audiences now regard as ' silent-film acting ' . SPOILERS AHEAD . This is one more Civil War drama which depicts the South as the good guys , or at least shows them sentimentally . ( The only black character in evidence - - a servant - - is played by a white actor in burnt-cork makeup . ) The Civil War has been declared : handsome young Charles joins up and puts on a Confederate lieutenant's uniform while his sister proudly displays the Confederate flag she's made . Then he eagerly marches off with his friends and fellow lieutenants , Wheeler and Carter , as they report to General Lee's campground . Although I can forgive these film-makers for failing to find an actor who resembles the actual Robert E Lee , the actor whom they do use here as Lee ( Edwin August ) is tricked out in a crepe beard that only just barely resembles the actual Lee's face foliage . Surely they could have got the beard right . Lee asks for a volunteer to take a sealed despatch to the front . Charles volunteers and is given the message . At this point , his nerve fails . He goes home to his brandy flask and his mother ; the latter immediately unseals the message ( thanks , mum ) , reads it , and realises it's got to get to the front . She sends her cowardly drunken son to bed , while Charles's sister puts on his uniform , tucks her beautiful long hair down the back of his lieutenant's tunic , and rides off to deliver the message . At this point , I noticed two oddities : the actress playing Charles's sister is significantly smaller and shorter than he is , yet his uniform fits her perfectly . . . and , when she mounts his horse and rides off , her technique indicates that she's had plenty of experience riding astride , rather than sidesaddle . When did this delicate Southern belle of 1861 ( when ladies rode sidesaddle , if they ever rode at all ) ever get the experience ? In the brief but well-staged battle scene , Charles's sister is killed in battle while wearing his uniform . . . and it's Charles who is reported dead . ( No autopsy , I guess . ) When this news reaches their mother , she decides that the family will be disgraced forever if Charles is ever seen alive , since his heroic death would then be known for a lie . When I'd got this far in reading the title cards , I figured there was only one possible solution : Charles would have to put on crinolines and hoop skirts , and spend the rest of his life impersonating his sister . ( Charley's Antebellum ? ) All joking aside : this melodrama takes place in the pre-tech era when a man could change his identity simply by taking a new name and relocating to someplace where nobody knew him before . It makes no sense for Charles to become a lifelong shut-in , rather than simply going away . Nor do Charles and his mother devise any plan to explain the permanent disappearance of Charles's sister . Worse luck , Charles's mother orders Old Black Joe to shutter the windows forever . Years pass . Charles and his mother acquire some ridiculous old-age makeup , and the white powder in the actress's hair seems to have spread to her clothes . Charles's friends Wheeler and Carter - - thinking him long dead and now themselves likewise in bad old-age makeup - - show up to put flowers on his grave . These two actors start emoting in unison , as if they were Thomson and Thompson in a live-action Tintin movie .

171,"Text1: Pretty enjoyable . After a spacecraft that had landed on Mars returns to Earth , a crew member is brought back with a rather hideous infection . In order to know what they're dealing with , doctors insist that the other survivor tell their doomed story , which makes up the balance of this picture . "" The Angry Red Planet "" has a slow and talky first half made up for by the interesting and innovative approach to the action on the Martian planet . The intense visual treatment referred to here as "" Cinemagic "" makes the movie quite impressive to look at ; everything is in shades of red and while many of the landscapes are obviously matte paintings , they're more provocative than cheesy . We also get treated to some rather amusing special effects - a three-eyed Martian ( played by actor Billy Curtis ) , an enormous man-eating amoeba , and especially the spider with the bat head . For me , any problems with the script or pacing were successfully counter-acted to a degree by all of this gimmickry . It's also an amusing artifact of the politically incorrect age of movie-making to have a macho hero ( Gerald Mohr ) who's a smug sexist , although his insistence on addressing his female colleague ( Nora Hayden ) as "" Irish "" instead of "" Iris "" gets old fast . The acting in this movie , for the most part , is not so hot , although it's nice to see two actors from "" The War of the Worlds "" - Les Tremayne and Jack Kruschen - perform here as well . The kind of thing that one might see playing late at night or early in the morning on cable channels , this is decent enough viewing for people like me who have a place in their heart for the sci-fi / horror favorites of the ' 50's and ' 60's .


Text2: You haven't got the guts Norman ! Another sequence of events in the post-sanitarium life of Norman Bates , in which he makes the acquaintance of troubled former nun Maureen ( Diana Scarwid ) and sleazy young drifter Duane ( Jeff Fahey ) and is also actively investigated by nosy reporter Tracy ( Roberta Maxwell ) . The most routine "" Psycho "" movie yet , an average and tolerable horror thriller but nothing more . It gets most of its mileage from the savvy performance of Anthony Perkins , who must have truly understood his tormented character more than ever by this point . Some interesting touches and a not totally unsuccessful attempt at creating suspense ( for the finale ) don't hurt . Of course , there is the obligatory dose of nudity and gory death ( not a lot of it , but some ) to please the 1980's horror audience , making this movie less of a Hitchcock homage than the first sequel and more of a typical modern scare movie . Supporting cast was okay ( a few cast members from "" Psycho II "" do a reprise of their characters ; I like Hugh Gillin best as Sheriff Hunt ) . "" Psycho III "" , marking Perkins ' directorial debut , is mainly , I think , for "" Psycho "" completists .

172,"Text1: Shouldn't This Be A Comedy ? ! ! ! ! ! POSSIBLE SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! You'd think a story involving Archie Grey Owl - An Englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . In fact I'd say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama . Worse , he's made an extremely dire film too . Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony ( Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he's a native American . The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman - That's why I wrote "" Possible spoiler "" it's not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English , but it's obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there's absolutely no surprise involved . Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn't actually a new concept . Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN ( And possibly THE TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn't actually been a great ecological film . In fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes GREY OWL , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor


Text2: Rita's Comeback Picture When one talks about Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford as a screen team , one is primarily talking about Gilda . There first film , The Lady in Question had them as featured players , second was the classic Gilda , third was The Loves of Carmen with a horribly miscast Glenn Ford . It was after that one , that Rita Hayworth married Aly Khan and was off the screen for four years . When she came back , Harry Cohn decided not to be too adventurous . Her last big success was Gilda with Glenn Ford , she got Glenn Ford . She was a singer stranded in the southern hemisphere in Gilda , she was again a singer stranded in Affair in Trinidad . Stepping into the George MacReady's shoes as villainous mastermind is suave and continental Alexander Scourby . Rita's husband is murdered and the Trinidad police inspector Torin Thatcher knows full well Alexander Scourby is behind it . Scourby is your international man of mystery in the Sydney Greenstreet , Orson Welles tradition . Thatcher wants Rita to spy on Scourby and she agrees to find out exactly what he's up to . In comes Glenn Ford into the picture as her late husband's brother . He wants some answers and nearly succeeds in wrecking the whole project . Good thing Rita's a quick thinking girl , a better thing is that Ford's a man of action , helps them both out in a pinch . Come to think of it , though Alexander Scourby is a fine player , Orson Welles would have owned this part and even better if he had directed Affair in Trinidad . This is just the kind of story that someone like him could have made into a classic . What a film to remember with Rita with her most well known co-star and another ex-husband as well . Harry Cohn probably would have shot anyone who brought him that idea , still it's interesting to speculate . Though Affair in Trinidad got panned by critics it cleaned up at the box office with all of Rita's loyal fans wanting to see her again . It's still a treat for fans of the screen's greatest sex symbol .

174,"Text1: A Triumph on Every Level ! LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fine stage play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen . This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors , fine music , brilliant editing , superb direction by George C . Wolfe , and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory ! Yes , it is just that good . The story is based on the author's life as the child ' Junior ' ( Marcus Carl Franklin ) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel "" Nanny "" Crosby ( S . Epatha Merkerson ) , a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the South , from mental hospitals , and from the streets to Lackawanna , New York . The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny . The myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business : Terrence Howard , Rosie Perez , Mos Def , the beautiful Carmen Ejogo , Louis Gossett Jr . , Jeffrey Wright , Ernie Hudson , Charlayne Woodward , Jimmy Smits , Patricia Wettig , Macy Gray , Liev Schreiber , Kathleen Chalfant , Lou Myers , Hill Harper - the list goes on and on . In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism , the history of desegregation , the dynamics of drug abuse and violence , the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture , and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact . S . Epatha Merkerson is wholly submerged in this role , a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos . She offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years , and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an HBO movie , she without a doubt would add the Oscar to place along side her Golden Globe award . The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master : like riffs in a jazz piece , he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues , jazz , dancing , and joy . The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story . Highly Recommended , almost Compulsory Viewing ! Grady Harp


Text2: Be Everything You Are Some films make a difference : viewing them can give us a story that is memorable and leave the viewer with powerful food for thought that continues to influence thinking long after the film is over . Such is the case for PEACEFUL WARRIOR . Based on a book by Inspirational Guru Dan Millman and beautifully adapted for the screen by Kevin Bernhardt , the story combines the best in sport stories with the infusion of spiritual discovery that despite the abundance of ' Hallmark-like ' imitations , stands nobly as a tool for introducing young people to a journey toward self discovery well worth taking . Director Victor Salva had the good sense not to push the story over the top , but instead to let his actors and situations grow logically into a practical demonstration of spiritual growth . Dan Millman ( Scott Mechlowicz ) is a gymnast bent on perfecting his skills to enter the Olympic trials . He is a fine athlete but has an ego that consumes everything around him and prevents his finding a focus to be the perfect athlete he feels he can become . After a chance encounter with a mysterious Service Station attendant whom Dan calls Socrates ( Nick Nolte ) , Dan's inner struggles begin to surface as he sees and experiences troubling ' other-worldly ' responses form Socrates . He is ultimately forced to confront that he is living for pride , for accomplishment , for competition , for recognition - yet his quiet moments remain discontent . Socrates works with Dan , helping him to find his inner self and to live in the moment . Dan suffers a life-threatening motorcycle accident that appears to doom his dreams of being the finest gymnast , but Socrates helps him discover that living in the moment , giving in to the power of focus on the present , can result in overcoming the seemingly impossible obstacles . Rather than ' preach ' these concepts , the story is illustrated by physical feats of gymnastics and by meaningful encounters between Dan and Socrates , and it is this technique that brings the film above the usual ' inspirational flicks ' to become a truly compelling movie . Nick Nolte has never been better as the subdued , understated , but immensely impressive Socrates . Scott Mechlowicz thankfully underplays the character of Dan : the use of a body double to perform the incredible gymnastic turns is seamlessly achieved . The remainder of the cast includes such fine actors as Amy Smart , Agnes Bruckner , and Ashton Holmes . This is a well-made film that deserves our attention , especially now . Grady Harp

175,"Text1: near classic prison noir / melodrama with excellent performances Brute Force is hard-hitting and ultimately quite tragic because the director , Jules Dassin , and his screenwriter Richard Brooks don't go for a simple , self-righteous "" bad guys always lose "" policy that movies had at the time thanks to the Legion of Decency and the Hayes Code . By the end of Brute Force , without giving a whole lot away , our ' heroes ' in the prison cell R-17 don't get away scott-free , but there's a greater indictment called upon that makes the film ultimately a lot richer than it would be in other hands . The film examines a penitentiary that has a warden but is basically run by cold-blooded , tyrannical Munsey ( Hume Cronyn , perfect for this weasel who is a true-blue torturer ) , and the convicts in cell R-17 , including Burt Lancaster in an early role as Joe Collins , among a handful of men who have committed crimes but are portrayed in flashback as not being particularly ruthless or horrible in their acts or deeds . If anything , Dassin and Brooks set up a particular sympathy for the criminals that might have just skirted by the strict side of the Hayes Code ( I wonder if the last words of the film , however crushing in existential tone , were forced on the filmmakers by the Hayes people ) by making the situation not really black and white at all . On the contrary , Brute Force is an alive and harsh piece of film-noir with some searing scenes of melodrama because there's some gray territory ( i . e . if it was black and white the Warden , too , would be ruthless and corrupt , but he just wants to run an orderly prison that his inmates will respect , unlike Munsey ) . Many scenes have that edge of a thriller , those surprise scenes that keep you talking after the picture ends like the guy getting crushed under the gears of the machine , or the torturing of the ' reporter ' , or even those somewhat predictable but heart-rending flashbacks that the prisoners have to their sweethearts on the other side ( some , sadly , divorcing , others sick and need care ) . All the while the performances are top-notch , especially from Cronyn , Lancaster , Bickford and Levine as Louie Miller . Sometimes it's hard to pull off a really surprising prison-break-out flick , but Jules Dassin treats it with the same entertainment value , as well as general tragic pathos , that made films like Rififi so memorable . It's a tough "" guy "" flick that has a heart .

177,"Text1: Mexican melodrama ' We the Poor ' is a somewhat overwrought drama by Ismael Rodr√≠guez , a Mexican director whose films often deal with social injustice and economic hardship . The hero of this story is Jos√© , nicknamed ' Pepe the Bull ' , although he looks more like Keenan Wynn than any sort of livestock . Pepe is a Mexican working stiff : the sole support of his family , including his young daughter Chachita and his paralysed mother , who can't speak or move but who can roll her eyes . Ay caramba , can this woman roll her eyes ! Pepe works hard , but the family are just barely getting by . ( They live in what appears to be a slum neighbourhood , although it's extremely clean . ) One day the caretaker walks in and helps himself to the rent money , which Pepe has stashed in a hole in the wall behind a photograph . The only witness to the theft is Pepe's mother . Being paralytic , she can't cry out during the robbery , and afterwards she can't tell Pepe who stole the money . But she sure can roll her eyes , while the camera zooms in for a close-up . ( It utterly beggars belief that Pepe and Chachita haven't worked out some means of communication with his mother , such as teaching her to blink in Morse code . Even the Bowery Boys were able to figure out that one . ) Now Pepe can't pay the rent , and pretty soon along comes a Mexican rent-collector ( Sancho the Bailiff ? ) to evict his family . There's a truly ludicrous scene in which the removal men take away every ornament and stick of furniture from Pepe's house . Then they come back and dump his mother on the floor , so they can take her wheelchair . They put the wheelchair in the lorry , then they come back again and take Chachita's doll . Buenos hombres ! Meanwhile , Pepe is in el juzgado ( ' the hoosegow ' ) because he's been framed for someone else's crime . Despite the soap-opera plot line and some very obtrusive background music , there's much in this film that impressed me . There's an excellent montage sequence , in which the caretaker is plagued by guilt for his theft . ( But not enough to give back the money . ) He keeps seeing pairs of circular objects ( two brass hoops in a bedframe , two saucepans on the wall ) and imagining them as Pepe's mother's eyes , staring at him remorselessly . One montage shot in this sequence seems to have been inspired by a similar shot in Fritz Lang's ' Metropolis ' . ( Always steal from the best . ) Some of the frame compositions in the prison sequences are extremely impressive . I started to laugh at the striped uniforms on the prison inmates , which reminded me of pyjamas , or the striped clothes worn by convicts in old Three Stooges movies . But apparently prison inmates in Mexico in the 1940s did indeed wear such uniforms . I had some trouble following the dialogue : many of the characters in this movie use slang expressions that were very up-to-date for urban Mexicans in 1948 , but which are inaccessible to Spanish speakers from non-Mexican cultures . A Mexicana friend who watched this film with me ( and who was born well after it was made ) told me that she couldn't understand most of the slang . There are some truly ludicrous soap-opera plot contrivances in this movie . Eventually we learn that Pepe's relationship with his daughter Chachita is not what it seems . Some of the twists in this movie are quite implausible . But it's extremely well-made , and the visuals are impressive throughout the film . I doubt that ' Nosotros los Pobres ' is an accurate depiction of life in Mexico in 1948 , but plenty of Hollywood movies are equally inaccurate in their depiction of life north of the border . This movie is highly entertaining , and I'll rate it .


Text2: Subtle ? No . Funny ? Yes ! ' The Woman with Four Faces ' is utterly implausible , but it's enjoyable hokum . Betty Compson stars in a role that gives her plenty of chances to pull the stops out while wearing outrageous disguises . The opening scene finds Liz West ( Compson ) on a ledge , wearing a mask . She's a cat burglar : she bursts into a posh upstairs parlour , holds a society matron at gunpoint , and makes off with her necklace . A few moments later , with a change of clothes , Compson has tossed the sparklies to her henchman and now she's posing as another victim of the same robber ! In subsequent scenes , we see Compson pulling off more robberies with multiple disguises . Richard Dix ( who gave excellent comedy performances elsewhere ) is stolid and humourless here as Richard Templar , the tough D . A . who is determined to put Liz away . . . if only he can get the goods on her . He manages to get Liz arrested and brought to trial . The results are extremely contrived , but still funny . On trial before Judge Westcott , Liz uses her good looks to vamp the male jurors . ( Sorry , but Betty Compson wasn't that good-looking ! ) Summoned to the judge's chambers , Liz lights up a cigarette ( this isn't just stupid ; it's illegal ) and then she offers the judge a stick of chewing gum ! Despite all this , she walks out of the courthouse smiling , due to lack of evidence . Templar decides to let Liz go if she'll use her criminal talents to help the law . Templar is trying to put away five narcotics pedlars who have conveniently signed a document outlining their business strategy . ( Yes , drugs dealers always put everything in writing . ) This document is , of course , just a McGuffin ( to use Hitchcock's term ) . Templar will arrange a full pardon for Marnie ( I mean Liz ) if she'll break into Judson Osgood's safe and steal this McGuffin . But Liz is merely the second best safecracker in the world . The only person who can open the safe is Jim Hartigan , who happens to be in prison at the moment . Hartigan is a crackerjack cracksman , but apparently he isn't a good enough yeggman to break out of prison . No , I take that back : as seen here , this prison is a nice comfy place where handsome young prisoners spend all their time in the exercise yard playing baseball . . . so ? apart from the total absence of totty ? Hartigan has no reason to escape . This is the cue for Betty Compson to put on an old-lady disguise and show up in the warden's office , posing as Hartigan's grey-haired old mother and begging the warden to release her ' son ' . Amazingly , this brilliant stratagem fails to work . Next thing we know , Liz uses an aeroplane to jailbreak Hartigan from the hoosegow ballgame during the seventh-inning stretch . Question : instead of all this umphery-bumphery , why doesn't District Attorney Templar use his office's influence to get Hartigan released into Templar's temporary custody ? SPOILERS COMING . Hartigan steals the McGuffin document with help from Liz , who passes it to D . A . Templar . Liz is expecting a full pardon , but the D . A . tells her ( in a title card ) that she's going to get ' a life sentence ' . . . as his wife ! Hoo boy . ' The Woman with Four Faces ' is extremely funny without being remotely believable . There are some impressive and elaborate sets ( notably the prison , and a mansion in the opening sequence ) , and there's some splendid stunt-flying during Hartigan's escape from prison . James Wong Howe's camera-work here is well up to his usual superb standard . Betty Compson was never a subtle actress , but her role here allows her to ham shamelessly in several guises . I'll rate this comedy .

178,"Text1: The Career Of A Chambermaid ( Dino Risi , 1976 ) This homage to Italy‚Äôs "" White Telephone "" films ( sophisticated comedy-dramas revolving around working-class girls ) of the 1930s gives Agostina Belli her best role ‚Äì going from chambermaid to prostitute to singer to film-star to mistress of ‚ÄòIl Duce‚Äô ! ‚Äì for which she received a special David Di Donatello award , the Italian equivalent of the Oscar . Incidentally , the English title evokes memories of Octave Mirbeau‚Äôs ‚Äòscandalous‚Äô novel "" Diary Of A Chambermaid "" ‚Äì thrice brought to the screen ( in Hollywood in 1946 by Frenchman Jean Renoir , in France in 1964 by Spaniard Luis Bunuel and in 1974 , typically as a sexploitationer , by prolific "" Euro-Cult "" exponent Jess Franco : the latter being the only one I haven‚Äôt watched and don‚Äôt own in any form ) . At other points in the narrative , the film also reminded me of A STAR IS BORN ( itself filmed several times ) and BELLE DE JOUR ( 1967 ) , Bunuel‚Äôs celebrated classy treatment of prostitution . . . The rest of the cast here is interesting : Cochi Ponzoni is Belli‚Äôs unlucky boyfriend , sent to various war-fronts but always turning up to curse and / or embarrass the heroine ; Vittorio Gassman as an ageing matin√©e idol of the silver screen whose speech impediment forces him to be dubbed ( a character inspired perhaps by John Gilbert ) ; Renato Pozzetto is a Fascist who lands Belli into a bordello run by is own mother ! ; Lino Toffolo is a musician she meets at the whorehouse with a peculiar idiosyncrasy which sees him dressed in a baby outfit and asking Belli to bottle-feed him ! ; Alvaro Vitali ( future protagonist of the low-brow "" Pierino "" sex-comedy series ) is also taken to the joint ‚Äì by his own father , who‚Äôs blissfully unaware of the boy‚Äôs homosexual tendencies ; and Ugo Tognazzi as a hunchbacked scavenger whose specialty is turning over Jews to the Fascists ! Its meticulous recreation ( especially the Venice locations , which include the Palazzo del Cinema , as well as the Excelsior Hotel my brother and I visited a number of times ‚Äì clandestinely , I hasten to add ‚Äì in September 2004 ! ) makes for a good-looking movie further blessed with a typically nice Armando Trovajoli score . However , despite its generally comic tone , the film is also effective as an expose ' of Fascism : at its most outrageous when Gassman plays a prank on his industrialist guests by faking a news flash in which it‚Äôs stated that the Government will be taking over all private enterprises ‚Äì only to have one of them asking to be excused and proceeds to shoot himself in the next room ! ; Gassman‚Äôs own fortunes are dissipated with a spell in a private clinic ( due to substance abuse ) , and he turns up to Belli‚Äôs chagrin during a party inaugurating the coalition of German and Italian Fascists ; his own demise is poignant as , while playing a Fascist in a comeback role , he is mistaken for the genuine article by a band of partisans ‚Äì they play at executing him via firing squad , but he actually expires out of sheer fright ! Finally , I should point out that the picture features a remarkably profane script which renders it particularly hilarious to those fluent in the language ( and are of the Catholic faith to boot ) !


Text2: A weak Martino is still a good movie - Torso may not be the best giallo that Sergio Martino ever made , but I'll argue that it has some of the most intense moments found in any of his films . The last 30 minutes or so are as edge-of-your-seat , tension filled as you'll see . The movie kicks into high gear when Jane ( Suzy Kendall ) wakes-up only to find all of her friends slaughtered . But the nightmare doesn't end there . The killer is still in the house , taking his own sweet time to dismember the bodies . Jane hides just inches away from the killer . This is incredible stuff . - It's too bad the rest of the movie isn't as good as the finale . Sure , there are some nice scenes - the girl being stalked though the swamp - but these moments can't compare with Jane's plight at the end .

179,"Text1: "" Volcano . "" About a volcano . The modern wave of movies about collective disasters began , I think , in 1954 with "" The High and the Mighty . "" I've been trying to figure out how and why they managed to evolve ( or devolve ) into gargantuan productions involving masses of humanity and such monuments to civilization as the world's tallest skyscraper ( "" The Towering Inferno "" ) and the city of Los Angeles ( "" Earthquake "" ) . I think it has to do with the natural development of simple things into more complex things . Something that succeeds begets things that are bigger than the original . I think Herbert Spencer made this observation with regard not just to organic systems like plants and animals but to human artifacts like governments and tax codes . Mies van der Rohe , the architect , described the reaction to this trend simply as "" less is more . "" But you can't fight city hall . In the end , MORE IS MORE . Take the original "" airplane in jeopardy movie "" , "" The High and the Mighty . "" The problem with an airplane that has partially failed is that the passengers and crew become the sinews that hold the story together - - their little dramas , their foibles . And either nobody dies or everybody dies . Well , unless you want to follow it up with a mid-air collision ( "" The Crowded Sky "" ) . In that case it's easier to stick to the strict moral formula and kill off the bad people instead of having to guide them through some epiphany in which they realize how wrong they've been . You can do so much more with BIGGER disasters , as depicted in "" Volcano . "" Not only do you get the same little human dramas , but you get multiple sub-disasters . In the kind of earthquake that generates a volcano in downtown Los Angeles , or what there IS of a downtown in Los Angeles , not only do buildings fall or almost collapse , but cars swerve and crash on the undulating roadway , fire mains burst , fires break out , dams fail and flood the villages in the valley , and ( if you want to push it ) airplanes can be forced by lack of fuel to land on runways that are being cracked apart by tectonic forces . The whole earth - - that thing under our feet that we always take for granted - - shrugs and heaves and makes us think about God . Yes . If we think about it , I suspect we can all agree that an earthquake is the best of disasters , especially ones that generate a flood of lava in a huge city . Great opportunities for computer-generated special effects . Loved ones can go missing - - and they may have been killed or saved , unlike that tiny airplane way up there in the sky in which it's all or nothing at all . Most of these sub-disasters happen in "" Volcano "" - - PLUS those plaster animals in the La Brea Tar Pits get swallowed up in their entirety . Tommy Lee Jones is separated from his daughter . Anne Heche is pretty and blond as the requisite scientist . The movie is frantic and doesn't give the audience much chance to breathe . No acting is called for and none is on display .

Jack in a convoluted effort to get the goods on Warren & Co . plans to use his own brother Dion , who in fact got him elected , to testify not only against Warren but himself with the help of his girlfriend Faye . Who as a chorus girl worked for both men who run nightclubs in the Patch . This illogical plan on Jack's part falls flat on it's face when he's tricked , by being mayor of the city , by Dion to marry him and Faye without knowing that a wife can't testify against her husband . Throwing Jacks entire plan of getting the corrupt political kingpin Gil Warren , through his brother Dion , right in the garbage can ! Outraged at being tricked by Dion into making a complete fool of himself jack slugs it out with his brother only to later have his and Dion's mom Mrs . O'Leary , Alice Brady , leave her prized cow Daisey , whom she was milking , alone by herself in the barn . It's then that Daisey kicks over a lantern that in effect , according to legend , started the Great Chicago Fire of October 8-10 , 1871 that destroyed almost a quarter of the city . Only worth watching for the amazing state-of-the-art Hollywood special effects , for the late 1930's , in showing the devastating Chicago Fire . With the Warren Mob , thinking that it was started by the mayor himself , rustling up a lynch mob to string Mayor Jack O'Leary up . With the fire quickly getting out of control the Warren hoodlums , lead by the future Creeper & Brute Man Rondo Hatton , are caught flat footed as the whole Patch District is blown to pieces . On orders of Gen . Sheridan , Sidney Blackmar , with hundreds of sticks of dynamite in order to put the fire out . Warren who instead of trying to put out the fire tried to start a new one by inciting a riot and is later trampled to death by hundreds of steers who escaped from the burning Chicago stockyards . The grand final has thousands of people from in and around the Patch district scurrying out of their homes in order to save their lives by escaping into the only avenue opened to them left by the great fire the shore and waters of Lake Michigan . The one barrier , natural or man-made , that the flames couldn't penetrate . Despite the great cast with an strikingly handsome Tyrone Powers who looked even better , if thats possible , after he got his brains beat in . There's also the gorgeous Alice Faye as well as the wonderful acting of Alice Brady . Who won an Academy Award for her role as Mrs . Molly O'Leary . Still the actors and actresses had to take second place to the special effects of Great Chicago Fire thats as heart-wrenching and exciting now as it was back then 70 years ago .

They aren't the most memorable of the Bond franchise . Joe Don Baker plays a weapons dealer who also dabbles in drugs . There is a guy who looks and acts sort of like Robert Shaw's character in "" From Russia With Love "" and another guy who plays the Brits against the Russians so he can get Bond to assasinate a guy . Other than the lack of a memorable villian though this Bond movie is really good . A great opening sequence , a cool car chase where Bond actually puts the gadgets on his car to good use , a great scene on an airplane , and many more delightful action scenes . This one also features the more simple formula as it involves weapons and drug dealings .


Text2: Mad Max with zombies . . . Yes , this movie to me was very good and action packed . However , I am not a movie critic just an average guy that likes to see loads of head shot action . If I were a movie critic I would probably say it was not very good . I was impressed that they picked up from the last one , as they did not seem to forget plot points I thought they might have from part two . The only thing missing were the little girl survivor from the last movie along with the Jill Valentine character ( which made me a bit sad ) . Still , one could just figure they died along the way so their absence by no means hindered the plot . So what is the plot , the world is overrun by the undead , infected by Umbrella's t-virus . Umbrella still exists , still experimenting for the good of themselves . Survivor's roam the lands , some by themselves . . . Alice for example , some as tightly knit roving communities on wheels that include a couple of familiar faces from part two , and then there are rednecks , who are idiots that deserve what Alice does to em . Alice meets up with her old friend and the caravan and plot a course towards possible salvation , meanwhile an Umbrella scientist once again locks in on her and needs a blood sample . Yes , this movie has loads of zombies and other nasty creatures and it has lots and lots of action . From an undead crow attack , to a Las Vegas zombie attack to a final showdown in one of Umbrella's hive facilities . This movie was very good and if this is the last one it ends on a good note in my opinion .

Text2: Jim Carrey , the Farrelly brothers & a disaster of a film We all ( well , most of us , at least ) know Jim Carrey . . . the master of physical comedy and facial comedy . We also know the Farrelly brothers , who've done a lot of R-rated crude comedies lately , and who directed Carrey earlier in Dumb & Dumber . Now , imagine that these meet , in a movie that's typical for the Farrelly's , with Jim acting the way he always does ( which is usually funny , even in bad movies ) . Sounds great , right ? Wrong . Wrong , wrong , wrong . The film has virtually no laughs at all , as it's taken to the extremes and beyond . . . constantly . The humor tries far too hard to be funny and shocking , and winds up being disgusting and embarrassing . The only laughs come from the three black teens in the film , one of whom being the nearly always funny Anthony Anderson , probably better known from Scary Movie 3 . Their characters talk like black rappers or kids from the ghetto ( swear words , yelling ) but are very intelligent , at the same time . This has a bit of a comedic effect , even though it's just a gimmick and it does wind up getting old , about half-way through the film . Carrey himself has some funny bits , but too much of it is just not him ; he's supposed to make funny faces , say funny noises and jump around . That's him at his best . The first Ace Ventura film is a good example of this , as is Liar Liar . However , in this film he doesn't get to use his talent for physical comedy all that much . Half of the physical comedy is just him being beaten up . . . it was good to see him fight himself , but there was too little of it . And why does half of the humor center around Carrey being humiliated ? The director of Ace Ventura 2 ( Steve Oedekerk ) made the same mistake , and look how ( un ) popular that film was . In conclusion , the only right director for Carrey is Tom Shadyac ( Ace Ventura , Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty ) , at least in my opinion . The plot is daft and poorly paced . The acting is nothing special . The characters are cardboard cutouts and stereotypes . The dialog holds very few memorable quotes , though there are a few . All in all , the film is just bad , by Carrey's and the Farrelly's standards ( and all other standards , for that matter ) . I recommend it only to the biggest fans of Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers .

182,"Text1: Not too bad , saved by the gorgeous Aimee Brooks & a good twist ending . Monster Man starts with friends Adam ( Eric Jungmann ) & Harley ( Justin Urich ) travelling across the desert highway to attend a friends wedding . While in a roadside bar Harley insults some of the locals & a short time later while back on the road the two friends are menaced by a large monster truck that tries to ram them off the road . Later that night at a roadside motel Adam wakes up to find some roadkill in his bed & along with Harley jumps in his car & speeds off only to discover stowaway hitchhiker Sarah ( Aimee Brooks ) in the back seat . They agree to give her a lift & carry on but the monster trucker won't go away & a trail of death & murder follows the three travellers across the lonely desert highway as they are pursed by a deformed psycho killer . . . Written & directed by Michael Davis this comic horror film firmly has it's tongue placed in it's cheek & is a bit of a mix of genres & other films that have come before it , while Monster Man isn't a great film I did quite like it & the gorgeous Aimee Brooks helps as does a neat twist or two at the end which I genuinely didn't expect . Monster Man is best summed up as a light hearted comic cross between horror themed road films like The Hitcher ( 1986 ) & Jeepers Creepers ( 2001 ) & maybe there's a little of the backwoods horror of the likes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) & Wrong Turn ( 2003 ) thrown in there as well . The Harley character is a bit annoying at times & can get on your nerves although some of the comic dialogue is fairly amusing with some reasonable one-liners although there's very little horror in the opening hour or so & it actually felt more like the comedy film Road Trip ( 2000 ) before the outrageous horror , gore & silly twists kick in during the last third of the film which is where the majority of the entertainment value came as far as I was concerned . I was surprised that I was surprised that the twist surprised me ! At the end of the day & at the end of the ninety minutes Monster Man is a fun modern horror film with an attractive cast , some over-the-top gore & violence & a fairly relaxed light hearted tone which makes it easy to watch & like . Monster Man doesn't have a point , it doesn't try to say anything deep or meaningful & it won't change your views on life or the world but for what it is you could do a lot worse . Visually the best part of Monster Man is Aimee Brooks . Period . She is very sexy in this & looks great in her skimpy black outfit . I recently saw her in The Mangler Reborn ( 2005 ) as well & she's hot in that too . As far as the blood & gore goes there's some good stuff here & none of it's CGI , there's a mangled corpse with it's eyeball hanging out , a guy has his legs run over & squashed & then his head is run over , someone is cut in half , there's a guy with his stomach removed , there's a slashed throat , someone's head is crushed in a vice , eyes are poked out & someone runs into a knife & gets it impaled through his throat . There's one sex scene but strangely there's no nudity . According to the IMDb the monster truck used in Monster Man was built for a paltry $2 , 500 & it was actually made out of wood rather than metal which was spray painted . Apparently it only had a top speed of 30 MPH & the film was sped up & treated to try & give the impression of speed which it plainly didn't have in reality . Apparently this had a budget of about $1 , 000 , 000 in Santo Clarita in California & the production values are slick enough , it's well made although the CGI monster truck scenes look poor . The gory prosthetic special effects are impressive . The acting is pretty good although Justin Urich as Harley can get really overbearing & annoying at times . Monster Man is an entertaining & pretty gory comedy horror film that does tend to move around genres too much but there's some good twists & Aimee Brooks

Text2: Vladimir , Answer the Phone Just think that if Doris Day had not for some reason named her dog , Vladimir there might have been no plot at all for this Frank Tashlin comedy . That might have been bad because this was the best of Doris Day's films in the late sixties as she was beginning a downward drop in her box office appeal . The Glass Bottom Boat was the second film she did with Rod Taylor as co-star and the first of two she did with Frank Tashlin as director . And this one was the best product in both associations . Doris works in public relations at a space lab in California where scientist Rod Taylor is developing new stuff for the Defense Department and NASA . She also doubles and helps her dad Arthur Godfrey on his glass bottom boat tourist vehicle . One of the things I like best about The Glass Bottom Boat is Doris sings again on screen , once in a nice duet with Arthur Godfrey on his ever present ukulele . She also sings her most famous song , Que Sera Sera once again for a new generations of film fans . One thing about Doris's later films , she always had excellent supporting casts and this one is loaded with some very funny people like , Edward Andrews , John McGiver , Paul Lynde , Dom DeLuise , Dick Martin , George Tobias , and Alice Pearce . They all fill roles that you would expect from them . The Glass Bottom Boat has Rod Taylor concerned with plant security in regard to his top secret work . An overzealous security guard played by Paul Lynde overhears Doris call her dog on the phone . What she does is that in order to give the pooch some exercise during the day she calls her own number , counts the rings and then says something to the unanswered phone . It's for the dog to get exercise because he runs around like a maniac when the phone rings . From that we deduce that Doris is a Soviet spy and the real CIA in the person of Eric Fleming is called in . This was Fleming's last big screen appearance before he was drowned on location in Peru . A very sad end to a career that might have been the equal of his Rawhide co-star , Clint Eastwood . Seeing Paul Lynde in drag , questioning an inept spy played by Dom DeLuise is worth seeing this film alone .

On the surface WAITRESS is a simple , honest , unpretentious , funny , tender , and sensitive film about simple people in a small Southern town : it is the core of the film , the examination of individual's choices , consequences , rights , and fraternity that makes the little Indie so special . And another feature that adds a dimension of significance to the movie is that actress / writer / director Adrienne Shelly did not live to see the magic she created : Shelly was murdered in November 2006 , a loss of a superb budding talent . Using a very small cast of characters WAITRESS takes place in a Pie Diner , owned by the crusty and demanding Old Joe ( Andy Griffith ) , managed by the grumpy Cal ( Lew Temple ) , and run by three waitresses - frumpy little Dawn ( Adrienne Shelly ) looking for love , been-there-done-that Becky ( Cheryl Hines ) whose married to a drooling waste , and Jenna ( Keri Russell ) , an unhappily married ( to Earl - Jeremy Sisto ) pie maker expert who longs to leave her marriage but has just discovered she is pregnant . She comes under the care of the OB-GYN Dr . Pomatter ( Nathan Fillion - also married ) and in the course of her care the two fall in love . How Jenna manages to cope with the disruptive pregnancy and the other waitresses deal with their simple lives is the crux of the story . And while this simple plot lone doesn't appear to offer much , the manner in which it is written and acted makes is a little jewel . Many are touting the emergence of Keri Russell as a serious actress as the reason for seeing this film , but the real genius behind the honest simplicity of the story is the sadly deceased Adrienne Shelly . She will be missed . In a series of fitting homages the featurettes add to the DVD version of this film . Grady Harp


Text2: A Dark Story in a Dark Place Without the Benefit of a Director's Enlightenment A LITTLE TRIP TO HEAVEN is a strange little Indie film by Icelandic director Baltasar Korm√°kur , a young director with some very fine ideas but with a script ( written both by the director and Edward Martin Weinman ) ' that is so spongy that the impact of the film relies on the considerable qualities of the cinematic images . Filmed primarily in Iceland with some scenes in Hastings , Minnesota , the mood is dank and dark and cold - and so is the story . We first meet insurance investigator ( ' adjustor ' ) Abe Holt as he listens to his boss Frank ( Peter Coyote ) explain to a new widow why she will not receive full death benefits because the insurance company took photos of her husband smoking , the apparent cause of his death . Abe just sits in the background but we know he is in tune with the fraudulent activity of the insurance company . Almost immediately he is assigned to a new case : an ex-con with a million dollar life insurance policy has apparently been found dead in a car crash burned beyond recognition . Abe drives to the tiny snowy desolate village where his questions of the townsfolk reveal that the victim was Kelvin Anderson , the brother of Isold ( Julia Stiles ) who is married to a low life type named Fred ( Jeremy Renner ) , a man who we have seen in flashbacks as the one responsible for arranging the car crash and setting the car on fire . Abe sneaks around the town , spies on Isold , and becomes involved in the investigation in more ways than the honest one . It is the interplay of the three - Abe , Fred , and Isold - that provide the intrigue and mystery of the apparent framed insurance scam . The screenplay is so full of holes that it is difficult to follow the case's development . The actors are superb artists : Forest Whitaker made this film almost simultaneously with his Oscar winning ' The Last King of Scotland ' yet here his character is plagued by an affected accent and by the lack of substance that might make us care about his plight ; Julia Stiles does her best with the little she is given to do and Jeremy Renner is convincingly menacing without any factors that make us find him worth caring about . The supporting actors ( Joanna Scanlan as a sleazy bartender , Iddo Goldberg and Philip Jackson as the police , Alfred Harmsworth as the ' son ' of Isold , and Vladas Bagdonas as the coroner ) actually fare better than the leads as far as material available . The strong aspect of the film is the visual imagery , due to the decisions of picture composition by Korm√°kur and cinematographer √ìttar Gu√∞nason and Mugison's musical is apropos for the mood . But the film remains grounded and a bit on the confusing side because of the director's lack of unity . One wonders why Whitaker , Stiles , and Renner signed on to this little film . Grady Harp

In the nothing-new-under-the-sun department the shots of the girl surrounded by goats would be replicated more than half a century later in Manon des source but Tourneur displays a deft touch throughout in terms of composition and for a lot of the time he is able to extract ' natural ' performances although the tendency to ' emote ' is never quite curbed . The story is mild melodrama ; the wife of the postmaster succumbs to the charms of the local squire , not the wisest thing with a jealous husband but the local shepherdess steps in to shoulder the blame . Hokey , maybe , but it was 1913 .


Text2: The Wheat From The Chaff We're definitely on the fringe of ' classic ' country here . A screenplay by those two masters Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost adapting in turn a novel by Colette , direction by Claude Autant-Lara and in the lead role the legendary Edwige Feuillere , a combination just made to upset Francois Truffaut and needle him into throwing his toys out of his pram . Tough , Francois ; too bad you didn't take a closer look at how the big boys do it before inflicting your juvenilia on us . But enough of poseurs let's get down to the nitty-gritty . Watching today it seems incredible that at the time ( 1954 ) this caused something of a scandal dealing as it does with love , to say nothing of sex , between a callow teenager and the effortlessly elegant , chic , sophisticated and dare I say it , beautiful and luminescent Feuillere . Questions do occur , mostly why , when she is all these things , is Feuillere actually available for teenage initiation , why isn't she fending off at least a dozen admirers , and why does she pick on someone as unprepossessing , gauche and scrawny as Philippe ( Pierre-Michel Beck ) and , if it comes to that , how come someone as nerdish as Beck has a delectable girlfriend of more or less his own age in the shape of Vinca ( Nicole Berger ) . Ultimately it doesn't matter because the combination of great writing , direction and acting from ' the lady in white ' make this a movie to treasure .

Text2: Hollywood grit . . . but on that level , well-done Both Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are very good as escaped racist convicts - - chained together by one wrist - - attempting to allude Southern police and their bloodhounds not far behind . Still , director Stanley Kramer's hot-blooded , hot-headed film stirs controversy with an awfully heavy hand . Kramer isn't interested in subtleties or details ; he plows ahead , full of angry , pumped-up steam , and the two brawling characters ( seen sometimes as two silly children ) each take turns spouting off . The clich√© of the lonely divorc√©e living on a lonely patch of land with her young ' un is played for high drama , but it lapses into camp . Still , the unspoken loyalty between the men is captured vividly ( thanks to the performances ) and the movie does pack a punch , even if its redneck / lynch mob / racially heated scenario feels Hollywoodized - - with do-gooder intentions - - and the theme of brotherhood is hammered home as if this were an educational film . from

In many ways , this is very ironic , as one of Pixar's best films , MONSTERS INC . , was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success . I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie , people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC . was an exceptional film . Now , Pixar gets some payback with one of their best , RATATOUILLE . Actually , RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar's best film , though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES . The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative - - I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film ( something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II ) . Plus , after years of making CG movies , the look is taken to a whole new level in this film - - it just looks breathtaking . Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid's movie as its predecessors . Sure , it can be enjoyed by the kids , but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept ( illegitimate birth ) and includes a swear word ( though not one the really "" bad "" ones , you can be sure ) . Also , while the rats are kind of cute ( and a marketer's dream ) , most of the rest of the story isn't and there are no catchy kid's tunes . No , instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities - - something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC . to be seen ( incorrectly ) as "" just a kid's movie "" . Amazing animation , excellent writing and , the rarest of rare , a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered . I can't wait to see it again .


Text2: interesting look into the world of film making This movie reminded me very much of Fellini's movie , 8 - - except it seemed a little more narrative and a lot less surreal than the Italian film . For some , this might mean that this Truffaut film is perhaps a little less "" exciting "" and more concrete , but I still preferred it to 8 . Truffaut played , what else , a film director making a film entitled "" Pamela "" . It was a little odd that the names were all changed - - the actors , director , producer , etc . I think this is because this isn't really a documentary but a movie about you watching a movie being made and so it isn't exactly reality . This left some questions , though , about where reality and fiction diverged . In particular , I was curious if Truffaut REALLY was hard of hearing , as in the role of the director he wore a hearing aid . I never saw Truffaut with one before , though he couldn't have worn it when he acted in the movie Wild Child , as it was set in the later 18th century ! Overall , the film was very interesting and worth watching . Great ? Not really , but certainly on of Truffaut's better films and much more conventional that the similar but wildly surreal film 8 .

A timely piece , this little film is about humanity and the possibility of communication by various means that overcome differences between cultures far better than treaties , summit meetings , and physical and verbal demonstrations . It is a thoughtful , engaging , and completely delightful success . The Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra with ' General ' Tewfiq ( Sasson Gabai ) rigidly in charge provides music for occasions , and the particular occasion for this venture is a ceremony in Israel . Flying in from Egypt well dressed in light blue uniforms to perform for the new Arab Culture Center , the small band is not met as expected at the airport . Tewfiq attempts to resolve the lack of proper greeting and transportation by reserving space on a bus - a trip that mistakenly ( through problems originating in language confusion ) results in the band being dropped off in a small village Bet Hatikva . Frustrated with circumstances , the band is met with genial hospitality by caf√© owner Dina ( Ronit Elkabetz ) who not only feeds them but puts the small band up for the evening . Dina has eyes for Tewfig and plans an evening out on the town with him - an evening that has its own surprises as each lonely person shares life circumstances . The other members of the band are placed in lodging with Dina's workers and at a dinner party discover similarities in their lives . Khaled ( Saleh Bakri ) , a somewhat antagonistic ladies ' man , spends an evening with a terrified young man Papi ( Shlomi Avraham ) on his first real date , and in the course of the evening introduces the fine art of courtship to Papi in a hilarious but touching scene . The use of English as the common language between these Arab and Hebrew speaking people adds elements of humor as well as moments of sweetness as both the band members and the Israelis grow to know and care about each other . The conversations among each separate group are delivered in Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles and this degree of modified privacy becomes almost more humorous because of the bumpy language barriers shared with the audience . Everyone grows through this short visit and by the time the band departs for their correct destination by the next morning's bus , bonds have been made that preserve the dignity of nationality while overriding the limitations of differences peculiar to each country . This is a quiet , gentle , at times very humorous little movie that offers insights of how to attain global community for us all .

Text2: Pretty Banal Storyline but with some Good Moments Courtesy of the Cast Rumor has it that this is a pretty banal movie . The rumor is true . Ted Griffin , the screenwriter from Pasadena , and a writer with some pretty fine screenplays under his belt ( Matchstick Men , Ocean's Eleven ) , somehow felt the need to cash in on the re-release of the classic film THE GRADUATE about his hometown idiosyncrasies and make a 30 years later ' sequel ' . Bad choice : the comparisons between the two films are just too far apart to endure tolerance from the audience . Rob Reiner has made some fine films in the past , but he lets this little bit of pastiche just get out of control . The few laughs that are implied come form some gritty lines from Katherine ( veteran Shirley MacLaine ) , playing the grandmother of Sarah ( Jennifer Aniston ) , who was the model for ' Mrs . Robinson ' in the book THE GRADUATE . It seems that Aniston returns for her sister Annie's ( Mena Suvari ) wedding to hunky Scott ( Steve Sandvoss from ' Latter Days ' fame ) with her affianced Jeff ( Mark Ruffalo ) only to realize that she doesn't seem to fit into Pasadena much less her family . Never close to her father ( Richard Jenkins ) she hears that her mother had a fling with one Beau ( Kevin Costner ) and that she may be the offspring of Beau and her mother . How she discovers the reality of the rumor is the point ( or lack thereof ) of the movie . With Aniston , MacLaine , Ruffalo , Costner and Jenkins in the cast the film has to have some good points - and it does . It is just that the idea for the story is too lame to digest and too poorly written to buy into , making this a film to watch only if you happen to love the cast . Grady Harp

Writer / director Kevin VanHook concocts a fresh , lively and inspired horror / action genre hybrid that delivers likable characters , a handy helping of graphic gore , a constant snappy pace , and plentiful rousing and well-staged action scenes . In addition , VanHook puts a novel spin on standard vampire lore : these vampires are extremely smart , hunt in packs , and can walk around in broad daylight . Van Dien and Grevioux are fine in the leads ; they receive able support from Tony Plana as amiable local innkeeper Javier , Ray Park as a pair of vicious martial arts acrobatic twins , Joyce Giraud as fierce , yet sexy vampire vixen Estrella , Lynda Carter as the hard-nosed Colonel Jessica Weaver , and Danny Trejo as jolly , wily fisherman Montegna . Matt Steinauer's slick cinematography and Ludek Drizhal's stirring score are both up to speed . Spirited and exciting , this nifty little feature makes for hugely enjoyable viewing .

In 1994 , Steven Spielberg and the film , Schindler's List , won countless awards and honors for it's subject on the Holocaust and how one German businessman , Oskar Schindler , caught in the struggle helped save over a thousand lives . Like Paul in Hotel Rwanda , Oskar was a businessman who was seeking opportunity in Cracow . Just like Paul , Oskar saved a thousand lives from the gas chambers and concentration camps . While Rwanda is nowhere near Eastern Europe and is located in Africa , we know very little about Rwanda . In 1994 , the Rwandan president was murdered leaving two ethnic groups , the Hutus , and the Tutsis as enemies again . The order was removed . The Hutus were incited by hatred , lies , propaganda , and direction from their leader to kill those "" cockroaches "" known as the Tutsis . By the end of the genocide , almost a million Tutsis were murdered . Paul is a hotel manager for a Belgium company , Sabena , who is put in charge . His wife is a Tutsi and he is a Hutu . The hotel has guests played by Nick Nolte who is a Canadian UN Peacekeeper unable to do anything because of red tape and Joaquin Phoenix is a cameraman for a news organization who risks his life to videotape the slaughter on the streets . For those sheltered at the Hotel , Paul maintains that it will be a safe place whether there is enough food , water , or supplies . Paul must bargain with the general who does not believe that he will be found guilty of war crimes against the Tutsis . The horrors of this genocide is not brutal because we don't see much blood but we see bodies lying on lawns and the brainwashed killers with machetes . Paul played by Don Cheadle definitely earned his Academy Award nomination as did Sophie Okeondo who was nominated . I wished it was nominated for best film of the year . Unfortunately , the western nations took their slow time in stopping the genocide . Rwanda does not have oil but coffee and tea . This story is about 1268 refugees who survived the genocide in 1994 .

David Hamilton ( Samuel Child ) had to take over the fatherly duties of the family after both the parents died . He's homosexual and has a way of luring specific males into his home , but these selected "" derelicts "" have no idea who they are really coming home to . Francis ( Cory Knauf ) is a weakly , fragile young man who loathes his family's secret practices which is to bring those selected victims "" lost to the world "" ( such as wanderers , hitchhikers , hippies ) into their basement for the removal of the blood . Blood , we come to understand sustains them . Without the blood , they'd die . Anyway , Wendell ( Joseph McKelheer ) is the hotheaded Hamilton who has problems restraining himself . Darlene ( Mackenzie Firgens ) is Wendell's twin who is probably as devious as her brother , but is able to be much more trustworthy and seductive . It's when she's on the attack of a victim with no escape where the true animal emerges . We see this when she brings a school chum / neighbor named Kitty ( Jena Hunt ) home for a sleepover . Wendell can barely hold his urges together as he's around Darlene and Kitty . . coping for the meantime until he'll be able to release and feed . Francis has a camcorder he uses throughout the film to record images of his family among other things and takes a shine to a captive hitcher named Samantha ( Rebekah Hoyle ) . He begins to feed her and talk to her , needing desperately for contact with someone who can hear his problems with this messed up family . Day by day , Francis is fighting a starvation that will kill him if he doesn't find sustenance soon . Confrontations with Wendell , who can be quite hostile towards his younger brother whose weak state obviously repulses him ( . . not to mention Francis ' sympathy for the victim which clearly raises an ire in Wendell ) , doesn't make life any easier as David spends a lot of time working at the local slaughterhouse . David also wishes to keep his troop together with attending to a social worker , Paul ( Al Liner ) who has the ability to split them apart if he sees anything abnormal or warped going on . Francis flirts with turning them in because he slowly cares for the captive girl , but siding against his family , the only people he's ever known proves quite difficult . With time running out for Sam , Francis will have to make a decision , one way or another . Unpleasant and disturbing , we get a look inside a group of savages who must survive by masking themselves into the suburban world of picket fences and white kitchens . Sure , Wendell and Darlene do not , unlike David , try to hide who they are and embrace "" the kill "" with relish . The twisted part of the film has this certain someone / something named Lenny locked in a little room the Hamiltons feed blood to . . anyone who sticks their hand in that door receives some nasty wounds . We watch in horror how they select , capture & torment those unlike themselves . Survival and deception . . that's the themes , I feel , are at play here . Francis will either embrace his own or side against them perhaps paying the ultimate price in return . How long can Francis deny who is as his physical conditions worsens ? Lots of things going on with this family and we see the results of their actions . Not as violent as it could be , this film plays more with what you don't see than bludgeoning us with excessive gory violence .

As adults Jason Scott Lee and Anne Parillaud are memorable . So is the cinematography , particularly the Dresden bombing scene which is simply jaw - dropping . Warning : the movie is heart-wrenching at times with not a happy ending , but I think that helps make this film so memorable , so haunting . Even the music is haunting .

Text2: like a brilliant four-part episode from the series ; lots of personal wounds revealed , and the Joker to boot ! Batman : Mask of the Phantasm stands on its own feet extremely well , when at least compared to some of the lessor Batman animated movies ( Batman vs Dracula anyone ? ) , and packs a good punch for fans so many years later . The original series was in its own other region - taking what more stories from the comics ( if not overall style and atmosphere like Burton or Nolan ) - and was able to cover some fine ground with our troubled hero the Dark Knight . This story tells of a character , not ever quite named but called here as ' Phantasm ' , who is killing off some of the high-rolling gangsters in town . Meanwhile , Bruce Wayne meets an old love of his , Andrea , and old wounds are opened over a brief and untimely ended engagement . And then there's also Andrea's father , who . . . OK , not much to try and spoil here , lets just say at some point the Joker gets involved , and everything jets into a ' laughing matter ' . Even as it was meant originally for TV , the directors Radomski and Timm , through their writer collaborators , have applied a drawing style that is distinctive amongst other cartoons of its ilk from the period : very direct lines and sharp , jagged edges , lots of smoke at ( specific ) times , the right blend of noir when it comes to revealing the caped crusader when he enters a room in the dead of night . In a sense they're stylists as are the ( good ) directors of the franchise live-action films . Only here there's a catch : the running time is short ( originally the filmmakers thought it would be meant for TV before WB changed their minds ) , so there's only so much time to dig into the dilemma Wayne is caught in in the movie , where his identity is being cross-checked all over as the killer of the gangsters , and then the personal connection with Andrea and her father . Its some fairly significant probing into the character , if not the deepest there's ever been . But also , aside from the slightly darker impulses , Mask of the Phantasm is a lot of fun , even up to a point if you didn't watch the series much . Just seeing Hammil ham it up as the Joker is a blast , even though he doesn't appear ( almost , one might think , as a lark ) until halfway through the movie ! But he ( via the filmmakers trying their best to give fans the best of the animated basics ) supplies a hugely entertaining climax , one which involves a big fight among an immense diorama of Gotham City , rigged with explosives !

195,"Text1: THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT ( Herbert Ross , 1970 ) This is another film I had missed out on a number of times on Cable TV in the past . It's considered something of a censorship milestone with the treatment of taboo subjects such as prostitution , homosexuality and pornography ? not to mention the proliferation of bad language throughout ( unfortunately , the DVD is said to contain the slightly edited PG-rated version , which cuts some brief nudity involving female lead Barbra Streisand and her use of the f-word in one scene ) ! With this in mind , one has to consider the development which the comedy genre underwent during this time : from the mildly risqu√© sophisticated antics of the Doris Day / Rock Hudson films of the early 1960s to the cynical anxiety-ridden variety that started emanating towards the tail-end of the decade ? with which the likes of Jack Lemmon , George Segal ( the male lead of this film ) and , in particular , Woody Allen ( since he was his own writer and mostly directed himself as well ) are forever associated . THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is also notable for giving the current female singing sensation ? Barbra Streisand ? her first non-musical role ; in fact , it led to other wacky comedy vehicles : foremost among them WHAT'S UP , DOC ? ( 1972 ; Peter Bogdanovich's updating of the Howard Hawks classic BRINGING UP BABY [ 1938 ] ) and FOR PETE'S SAKE ( 1974 ; whose trailer , included on the Columbia R2 DVD of the film under review , makes it seem like a good deal of fun ) . Thanks largely to his role in the film , Segal went on to do his fair share of sex comedies up till the early 1980s ? with the most successful among them being A TOUCH OF CLASS ( 1973 ) , which I should be acquiring shortly . Anyway , to get to the main item : the film can be seen as a modern variation on the perennial "" Pygmalion "" theme ? with Segal as intellectual but , at the same time , neurotic and Streisand the uncouth yet liberated woman . There's no plot to speak of ? instead , we follow the two stars on a logical pattern of location-hopping around New York throughout which their relationship blossoms : from his apartment when she's evicted because of his snitching ( which leads to both of them being given the gate by the landlord ) , to them shacking up at the flat of Segal's pal ( who drives them out because of their constant bickering ) , then going their separate ways till they meet again ( after he has learned about her movie experience ? a hilarious scene ? and a ' colleague ' of hers has gone to see him at his workplace ) and go out together ( where they're harassed by a band of thrill-seekers ) , after which they find themselves at the house of Segal's fianc√©e ( a scene with an unexpectedly ironic punchline ) , to finally deciding to be completely honest with one another ( beginning with their real names ) . In this respect , the film emerges to be overly talky ( betraying its stage origins ) but there is a reasonable amount of invention and wit in the undeniable comedy highlights : Segal dressing up as Death to scare the hiccupping Streisand ; Segal using an aquarium as a TV set ? with him delivering an impromptu news flash ? to humor the insomniac Streisand ( her addiction to TV is illustrated by a surprising reference to the Lionel Atwill / Lon Chaney Jr . horror pic MAN MADE MONSTER [ 1941 ] ) ; the couple's argument over "" the sun spat morning "" line in the opening paragraph of a book by aspiring novelist Segal ; Streisand's account of the sordid activities her clients invariably came up with ( prompting Segal to describe her as "" a sexual Disneyland "" ) , etc . The film's soundtrack is highlighted by several songs from jazz / rock band Blood , Sweat & Tears .


Text2: THE SKULL ( Freddie Francis , 1965 ) This was among the first vintage horror films I recall watching , but it took me this long to re-acquaint myself with it ( after I had foolishly abandoned the prospect of a second viewing as part of a late-night Italian TV program hosted by two amiable ghouls ? the same thing would also happen with Hammer's FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL [ 1974 ] , which I then had to wait some 13 years to catch up with ! ) . Anyay , though the film's premise , in itself , is rather daft ? that of a host of antiquarians being ' possessed ' by the skull of the Marquis De Sade ? the result is very stylish and altogether one of Hammer rival Amicus ' most satisfying outings . Apart from director Francis , the men behind Amicus ? Max J . Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky ( the latter also scripted , from a story by Robert Bloch of PSYCHO [ 1960 ] fame ) ? again recruited Hammer's two most popular stars , Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee , for this production . As ever , they play extremely well off each other ? even if Lee , ostensibly , is only a "" Guest Star "" ? delivering typically committed performances : Cushing has fun acting crazy ? under the influence of the skull ? towards the end ( and also during a surreal nightmare sequence in which he's forcefully taken before a judge who promptly hands him a gun to play at Russian Roulette ! ) , whereas Lee gives surprising poignancy to his role . Supporting them is a splendid cast indeed ? led by Patrick Wymark , who actually matches the stars with his seedy supplier of generally weird artifacts , and the brief ( albeit equally welcome ) presence of the likes of George Coulouris , Michael Gough , Nigel Green and Patrick Magee ! While Francis creates wonderful atmosphere via the cinematography ( particularly when shooting through the skull's eyehole ) and the set design ( the film starts off as a period piece but then reverts to a modern-day setting for the central plot line ) , I do feel that the possibilities presented by the nonetheless intriguing theme are regrettably constrained by censorship and budgetary restrictions ? so that the Marquis De Sade's legacy seems somehow to have been mixed up with that of Jack The Ripper ! In any case , THE SKULL is generally considered nowadays as Francis ' best directorial effort ? though I personally feel NIGHTMARE ( 1964 ) , THE PSYCHOPATH ( 1966 ) and THE CREEPING FLESH ( 1973 ) to be superior to it ?

She suffers from visions of childhood trauma's while she's filling up with fury and hatred towards a rich , ignorant man . She kills him and flees ? chased by the police and haunted by her own morbid imagination . Keeping in mind this film was made in 1953 , it becomes even more interesting ! The US censorship didn't like it at all and the film barely received showings ? No surprises there because , even though the film doesn't contain explicit violence , it's very unpleasant and disturbing to look at . Every character that walks through the screen is unsympathetic and someone you don't want to run into in a dark alley . The atmosphere this film breathes feels like David Lynch's Eraserhead avant-la-lettre , and I wouldn't be surprised if he found some of his inspiration and enthusiasm in Dementia . This film is perhaps a little too weak and messy to refer to as avant-garde , but it does float somewhere between that and cheap B-cinema . Up to you to decide where it's categorized best ! One thing is sure , though ? Dementia is food for thought at film-Academies . I saw the original version of this lost film at a festival , on the big screen and guided by a life-orchestra of cello's and a piano . The film itself doesn't contain any dialogues and therefore this chilling music brought it up to an almost unbearable cult-experience .

Text2: One of the best films ever and is great a welcomed episode in the Star Wars Saga ! ! ! May have spoilers for the majoe Star Wars fan . All of this is MY thoughts and opinions . The wait was finally over and I saw Star Wars : Episode II : Attack of the Clones ! From beginning to the end I was not disappointed . I thought everything was fantastic , the acting , the action , the CGI , the dialogue scenes , and all of the characters was good . These are the things most of the people complain about and I don't see the problems . I guess because I am thrilled to see a spectacular film and am thankfull to be a part of history . Now , I think this film is a pure Star Wars film , I loved The Phantom Menace and the first trilogy and I really like Attack of the Clones . The film is directed really well and the color and the brightness of the movie is something special . AOTC is very fast paced and it really doesn't seem like it is over two hours . The characters in this film are just as original as they were before . Here is some small bios on some of the major characters in the film . Christopher Lee as Count Dooku / Lord Darth Tyranus - First of all I was so thrilled that the legendary actor would play a major sith in this epic ! Lee is incredible in this film . He is so powerful and uses a curved lightsaber . His voice is scary and he is a very intelligent sith warrior . He is afraid of no man and he handles everything just right . He is just such a great dark lord . I like most of the characters in Attack of the Clones but Count Dooku is MY favorite ! Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker - Christensen was really good as the now grown up Anakin . He had lot of emotion in the film and I could feel it . Thru out the film he has lots of hard times and of hate and he showed it well . Christensen was really good ! Temeura Morrison as Jango Fett and Daniel Logan as Boba Fett - The Fetts is a awesome duo of father and son . Jango really treats his son good . Morrison acts as Jango seriously and is remarkable when he has his armor on . When Obi-Wan came out of the Cloning center and saw Jango and Boba was there with their ship Slave I , I really felt emotional when Jango said to Boba get on board . It was a combination of how he said it under his Mandalorian helmet and I really like the duo . Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi - He really is wiser now since the time has passed . McGregor has no problem with his character and I really like it when Anakin said to him you are the closest thing i have to a father and Kenobi said then why don't you listen to me ? I really liked that ! Natalie Portman as Padm√© Amidala - Portman is great in AOTC . Her conversations with Anakin are believable and she looks great too but what I really like about her character is her facial expspesions . Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine / Darth Sidious - Once again a great performance by Ian McDiarmid , as the Supreme Chancellor he shows much innocents and as the sith lord he acts like he did in the TPM and the ROTJ which are good . Leanna Walsman as Zam Wesell - Tell you the truth I really like Zam , she is a cool bounty hunter and belive it or not when it comes I think she is arguably better looking than Padm√© . Samuel L Jackson as Mace Windu - Windu has a much larger role here at he goes into battle . As always Jackson did a good job as Mace Windu . Frank Oz as Yoda - The CGI Yoda is fine with ME , he still looks realistic and where he battles at the end of the film was very impressive ! Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa - Smits has a small part but what he is given he does it fine . Anthony Daniels as C-3PO and Kenny Baker as R2-D2 - Like before in the previous films they are very good , enough said ! Jay Laga'aia as Captain Typho - Good performance by this newcomer , I look forward to see Jay in other films and hopefully more of his Captain Typho","{""output"": ""YES""}"
201,"Text1: Dreary , empty and depressing version of Remarque's novel . . . INGRID BERGMAN's immense popularity during the ' 40s was the only factor to save this film from instant oblivion . It was a huge box-office failure , but nobody blamed Bergman who still looked luminous despite her deadly dull assignment opposite CHARLES BOYER , as the protagonist facing deportment during World War II's Nazi reign . All the ingredients that seemed to make ARCH OF TRIUMPH into a "" must see "" film were there . First , it's from a novel by Erich Maria Remarque who gave the world ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT . Then the cast included Bergman , Boyer , CHARLES LAUGHTON and LOUIS CALHERN . Then , it was directed by Lewis Milestone and released in time to be considered for Oscar nominations . Alas , there were none and it opened to humiliating reviews . It's a deadly dull affair between Boyer's refugee and Bergman's lady of the night and whatever interest the story might have had is made tedious by the slow funeral pace of the story with its dimly lit exteriors and interiors . It's a thin story without much significance and it's shabby as a piece of entertainment . Not even the great Charles Laughton can save it , his role is so obscure in the scheme of things . Not worth seeing unless you must see every film Ingrid made . She and Boyer were paired much more successfully in GASLIGHT four years earlier . Trivia note : The film's running time was slashed after terrible reviews but restored to 131 minutes for arhival prints .


Text2: Lee Marvin reprises his "" Cat Ballou "" characterization . . . PAINT YOUR WAGON is one of the messiest musicals I've ever seen on screen , but there are a few compensations among the cast of non-singers in the principal roles . One , is getting to hear HARVE PRESNELL do a nice professional job on "" They Call the Wind Maria "" in one of the film's opening musical numbers - - and the only really great song in the show sung by a pro . Unfortunately for Presnell , he's hardly seen in the rest of the movie . The other halfway decent number is performed by CLINT EASTWOOD ( "" I Talk to the Trees "" ) but it's practically a throwaway . The other is the compensation for seeing LEE MARVIN reprise his "" Cat Ballou "" characterization all over again with a liquor bottle to his lips and the most impoverished looking costumes and make-up this side of skid row . He makes the most of his role as a scroungy looking boozer and even gets to recite some of the screenplay's wittier lines . And all of the rustic humor of the piece gets some nice backdrop with the Oregon scenery looming majestically in the background . But given the final pictorial result in rather muddy looking color , it wouldn't have mattered if the scenery was painted or not . Still another compensation : JEAN SEBERG looking lovely as the woman who has all the menfolk staring at her good looks ( there's a huge shortage of women in camp ) . She , Marvin and Eastwood are a pleasant trio and bring some energy and humor to their roles . But the songs by Fredrick Loewe are poorly integrated into the plot , most of them not even remotely approaching Loewe's earlier musical collaboration with Allan Jay Lerner . And worst of all , it's directed at a snail's pace by JOSHUA LOGAN who made such a mess of other Broadway hits , like SOUTH PACIFIC . Strangely enough , for a musical , there's no choreography to speak of - - the songs just seem to happen and most of them are highly forgettable , especially the "" Gold "" number sung in the mine . A nice ballad called "" Wandrin ' Star "" gets some nice male choral background treatment but has Lee Marvin talk / singing the lyrics . Two hours and forty-eight minutes is a long time devoted to a musical where only one professional singer is given a decent song to sing . This is the pits . As a comedy full of brawling gold-miners , it has some passable moments . As a musical , it just comes to a standstill for the songs and then lumbers on interminably until the "" No Name Town "" crumbles and falls into the earth like a modern Sodom getting its final destiny after a sinful existence . PAINT YOUR WAGON seems to exist in a strange no man's limbo , an uneven mixture of passable rustic comedy given a weak , almost bland musical score . No wonder that despite being given the roadshow treatment when it opened , it fizzled at the box-office .

202,"Text1: A Worthy but disappointing effort on the Civil War I applaud their efforts about America's darkest hour which was the American Civil War from 1860 to 1865 . The drama is that it was brother and brother , north against south . America lost more men on it's own battlefields in this war than any foreign wars combined . While Europe remembers two World Wars , America must remember the Civil War . It's sad and depressing to know that most Americans know less about the Civil War than foreign wars . Anyway , the film's battle scenes are shot exquisitely . The brutality and force of the war must be seen to know the evil and horrors of any war . The Civil War is a tough chapter in American history . Unfortunately , this film is almost four hours long and there is so many situations and characters about that you can easily get lost in it . I watched it on video at home . My boss who is a big Civil War buff drove almost 2 hours to see this film and liked it . While some of us are not geared to watching war movies , if you like Gettysburg , you will like Gods and Generals . The actors , Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall who lives in Virginia himself perform brilliantly and almost unrecognizably . I also liked Frankie Faison in the film as a Black soldier . If this film was released on television as a mini-series , I have no doubt that there would have been awards . The scenery , costumes , and art direction have spared no expense . I believe it was a mistake to release it in theaters because I don't think audiences can sit through 4 hours of this film . Ted Turner , the media mogul , did a service to producing this film . Maybe students in American classrooms will learn to appreciate the magnitude of the Civil War . I'm giving it an 8 .


Text2: she didn't and she won't change my life This movie is at number 14 in the top 250 . It was nominated in several categories for the oscars by March 2002 . All around the world , Am√©lie Poulain elated millions of people . The question I ask myself is this one : why did this film make millions of people so happy ? I saw it last year at the cinema ; it's not that I didn't like it , it left me indifferent and I watched it very carelessly . A naive girl whose name is Am√©lie Poulain discovers what her destiny is : make people happy . She'll succeed in before she falls in love with a man ( Mathieu Kassovitz ) . I think it's a lacklustre and dull film . The screenplay isn't very entertaining and it looks as if there is no plot . The main thema of the movie , which is for Am√©lie to make people happy , is more sketched out than really explored . Moreover , the dialogues are vain and most of the characters are talking for nothing . Above all , several sides of the film didn't please me , especially its humor . The movie wants to be funny but according to me , the humor usually falls flat and sometimes it can fade into the heaviness like the love scene in the cafe . There is something that I don't like in the Am√©lie Poulain's character ; I think she is dope , a bit dumb and she's got very odd thoughts ( how many couples will have an orgasm in the next second ! ! ! ) . Besides , the actors aren't very great . I mean that they aren't very well defined . We learn what they like or don't like but for most of them , their tastes or hates are only tics ( like Jamel Debbouze who cherishes fruits and vegetables because he's a greengrocer ) . On the other hand , some elements of the film are useless and barely bring interest to the movie , I think about Am√©lie's father who loves his garden gnome , or the old man who tries hard to reproduce Renoir's painting "" le d√©jeuner des canotiers "" . To sum up : Am√©lie's destiny's got nothing fabulous and it's a film that lacks of poetry and is a speading of clever visuals and ringing brainwaves .

203,"Text1: like one big collection of classic Hitchcock sequences , strung together by one red-herring after another , plus Cary Grant Although I wouldn't rank North by Northwest in the highest pantheon of Hitchcock's masterpieces - it won't ever get as deep or revelatory or demanding of repeat viewings as Psycho or Vertigo or Rope - it's got enough crackling , dry-sharp wit and incorrigible suspense sequences for an excellent time . One can tell that Hitchcock might be reaching at times to get commercial appeal , even more than usual with his films of the 50s ( and after Vertigo and before Psycho , he's trying to make up for what he thought of as lost ground ) . But it's a commercial entertainment that still hails high above the ranks of today's proficient but soulless demonstrations of panache with archetypal heroes and villains in double-cross moves . Thornhill ( Cary Grant ) is an advertising man who gets the typical-Hitchcock ' wrong-man ' scenario , and as typical too involving a ) spies , b ) government espionage with the all popular ' MacGuffin ' , and c ) a blonde leading lady with her own issues to deal with in the middle of the men . The villains in this case are the very calm and collected James Mason and his leering henchman Martin Landau , as a quasi-chase develops across the country all over George Kaplan - who , by the way , doesn't really exist . The plot , to be sure , is cobbled together under Ernest Lehman's attempts to put together something that Hitchcock would respond to and , more crucially , afford him his two favorite pastimes - one is the witty , very knowing dialog meant exclusively to lighten potentially clich√©d territory and give grins to others ; the scenes with Grant and Saint in the train car , trading off innuendo , is one scene that over-steps the problematic territory , in general their chemistry is elevated thanks to Lehamn's snappy , amusing words . There's even a great bit provided by Thornhill's mother , played by Jessie Royce Landis , as one of Hitchcock's older who smirk things like "" You gentlemen aren't REALLY trying to kill my son , are you ? "" The other pastime are absurd but completely wonderful sequences where a character or characters get pitted against larger-than-life odds . The hallmark crop-duster scene was the one I had seen even before the whole film , in a class where the sequence was broken down ; this , along with Psycho's shower scene , make up some of the most accomplished executions of storyboarding , and how timing and details of the figures in a shot , and the intensity or lack thereof , that Hitchcock's ever done . The Mount Rushmore climax - save for what happens to Grant and Saint following the cliffhanger moment , which is my least favorite part of the movie - is also stellar , including what precedes it in the hideout . North by Northwest is essential viewing , but is it really a completely devastating triumph like Hitchcock at the peak of his powers ? Not exactly , as there's some moments where it feels like Hitchcock on auto-pilot with some of the twists and preposterous turns , and he's really more into his suspense scenes and getting Grant perfect in these scenes more than anything else . There's also not much depth to the whole process , yet that's part of its appeal as a yarn of an adventure story . But as a suspense-comedy , it's a work of big-studio success , as Grant comes off on note in every scene he's in , and helps make even the smaller , supporting actors seem important in the grand scheme of the story . In a way it's a great Hitchcock film in the sense that you can just curb the usual logic at the door and just hop along for the ride , and it's in this that North by Northwest should always be remembered ( alongside the Bernard Herrmann score , one of his best ) .


Text2: it's action and ' what's coming round the bend ' entertainment , nothing more or less Poseidon is based on a novel , technically , although most will associate it with the original film The Poseidon Adventure from 1972 , unseen by me . What I do know whenever someone mentions it is that Shelley Winters is very memorable in it ( and actually when they refer to her career they bring up that film or Lolita ) . But I knew basically that this was your standard Hollywood-sized blockbuster with a man who could either hit just well enough or miss ( Wolfgang Peterson ) . What he provides by way of being director serves this material more than the lackluster Troy from two years ago . Here he's in his element doing something very elemental , however a lot of the time abandoning logic like the several passengers from the ship . It's popcorn entertainment on a scale that I enjoyed for what it was , while noticing that the investment in the characters was only up to a very small point . Then again , I'm not seeing this film for character development , and the screenwriter Mark Protosevich knows this so he just gives unpretentiously what's needed - the main cast who are all just ' types ' ( i . e . Russell is ex fireman turned mayor , Dreyfuss an architect , Josh Lucas a natural leader , and various female roles of equal strength and shame ) . While I can't completely recommend the film like I would other more successful big-budget ' disaster ' films , I can recommend it perhaps more than others , and unlike the other three big films from this month it doesn't necessarily kid itself too much or go for a way too muddled storyline . And it is actually best to see the film on an IMAX screen ( its effectiveness may actually be lost somewhat once its on TV ) , where the actual first turning point of the ship getting tossed over by the ' rare ' wave is almost worth the price of admission alone for its visual prowess and , indeed , excitement . The rest of the picture is just a series of cliffhangers ( some more literally than others ) , and a lot of running , swimming , ( some ) drowning , and heavy-handed dialog when need be . Peterson is also smart enough here , unlike with Troy , not to overstay the welcome with the material . It's compact enough to be enough of a vehicle of danger and with the technical side all intact , while the characters only get testy up to a point . Some of the early scenes are , of course , too predictable ( even if Dreyfuss's romantic side seems a little displaced and unnecessary ) , as one just wants things go forward with the action . Luckily , on that end , in the tradition of bubble-headed ( pun intended ) thrillers with all the elements of a matin√©e serial , it's not bad .

206,"Text1: A tragic life - A tragic death Based on a true story from 1930 , The Pyjama Girl Case is a difficult movie to categorize . It is more often than not considered an Italian Giallo , but is it really a Giallo ? Even though I've included it on my Top 50 Giallo list , The Pyjama Girl Case differs so much from the model that I'm not sure this label is accurate . There is no black-gloved , masked killer . There is no string of over-the-top murders . The Pyjama Girl Case lacks the stylish look of most Gialli . And , there is no sense of dread or real tension usually associated with the genre . So , why do I include The Pyjama Girl Case on my list of favorite Gialli ? this is not a good answer , but I do it because everyone else does . If it's not a real Giallo , then what is The Pyjama Girl Case ? I would say it best fits in the drama category with touches of a police procedural thrown in for good measure . The Pyjama Girl Case is the story of a mysterious half-burned body found in an abandoned car on a beach . In addition to being burned , the body also shows signs of severe head trauma and a bullet through the neck . The case is particularly interesting to Inspector Thompson ( Ray Milland ) , a retired detective wanting one last case to investigate . Using outdated techniques and very few clues , he is determined to find the killer before he rides off into the sunset . I disagree with a lot of what I've read and feel Milland is one of the films weak points . His crotchety old man routine is rather predictable . His Inspector Thompson is the clich√© for the "" non-conforming just because I'm old "" type character . The Pyjama Girl Case's structure can be off-putting to some . In addition to the police investigation , the film also features a concurrent look at the events leading up to the girl's death . It can be confusing at first because of the uncertainty of what's going on , who these people are , and how they relate to each other . But everything works out in the end and all the pieces fall into place . The girl's story is a tragic one . Her life is a series of miserable events ( a bad marriage , a miscarriage , a string of unfulfilling relationships , etc . ) all leading to her brutal murder . The girl is played by Dallia Di Lazzaro in a very memorable and believable performance . She gives her character a sense of depth not often found in Italian movies of this sort . She is easily the highlight of the movie for me .


Text2: Good cast in Western journey . After World War II , Jimmy Stewart's career seemed to stall . He was no longer the piping-voiced naive youngster , and it's difficult to believe that his war experiences hadn't affected his real character in some way . This was one of a series of Westerns Stewart made under the direction of Anthony Mann , one of the best and probably the most brutal . There had been an undercurrent of an unstable passion in Stewart's post-war movies , hinted at in "" It's a Wonderful Life , "" especially the scene in which Stewart is on the phone , about to accept a job that will take him out of Bedford Falls , and decides instead to stay in town as Donna Reed's husband . When he grabs her , trembles , and sobs into her hair , Donna Reed - - the actress , not the character - - seems almost embarrassed by Stewart's intensity . That's the part of his personality that this movie cashes in on . What a cast ! Jimmy Stewart is a bounty hunter driven by revenge . Robert Ryan is the prey he captures , along with the girl , Janet Leigh . Ralph Meeker is an ex Army officer , thrown out because he was judged "" morally unstable . "" Millard Mitchell is a wretched prospector . And what odious characters they play ! Stewart is haunted by his demons and is not a superman by any means . He can't climb a rope up a sharp cliff face but Ralph Meeker can . Meeker himself is a scuzzbag who almost gets everyone killed because of his treatment of a Blackfeet woman . Leigh thinks she loves the outlaw and murderer . Mitchell is one of life's losers - - fundamentally decent but willing to do just about anything to strike it rich . Ryan is superb . He transcends himself as the unshaven , sloppy , jocular , philosophical captive who is worth a lot of money , dead or alive . Everyone joins in to bring him to the law but things fall apart and only the center can hold . After all the bullets and treachery and skulduggery , only two survivors are left . Guess who . It's relatively realistic , unlike , say , a Gene Autry or Randolph Scott or early John Wayne Western . As these folks travel through forests and up and down mountainsides , they look dressed for the part , in thrown-together dusty wardrobes of no particular distinction . Stewart - - the hero , mind you - - wears unglamorous chaps while he rides his favorite horse , Pi . Ryan looks the worst of all , his black hat tilted back on his head , all smiles and laughter . The script even gives him a bit of dignity . When Stewart unties Ryan's hands and challenges him to draw , Ryan claims his hands ain't fit , and says , "" If you want to murder me , Howie , you'll have to make it look like what it is . "" Ryan's range was greater than he's sometimes given credit for . Even strictly as a heavy , he could inform the role with a variety of characteristics . His heavy in "" Crossfire "" is polite and subordinate except when crossed , when his eyes seem to glitter with menace . His heavy in "" On Dangerous Ground "" is coldly psychopathic . His heavy here , had he been in a contemporary movie , would have been one of those happy-go-lucky killers with "" BORN TO BE BAD "" tattooed on his upper arm . Of course , today the fist fights and shootings seem tame - - hardly a drop of blood in sight - - but at the time it was pretty dark stuff . Interesting film . You probably won't be bored .

Genevieve Bujold plays a radio relationship talker , Dr . Love . She has severe issues herself with love and sex . Keith Carradine is a drifter who enters their lives . . . and things go barreling out of control . Very strange but great movie .

There's a virtually nonstop score by Teddy Pendergrass - - soft romantic songs that perfectly set the mood . All the dialogue is about love , sex and relationships but on a very adult , intelligent level . It's full of great lines and sharp insights . It all leads up to a happy ending ( sort of ) . The cast is just excellent . Warren is fascinating - - sexy and beautiful but deeply damaged . She shows it through her face and expressions extremely well . Carradine plays the whole role with a blank face - - but that fits his character ( a compulsive lair ) . He is so many things to himself and everybody else that he has no identity . Best of all is Bujold in a very difficult role - - she has the play a sex radio therapist who is perfectly in control and a woman who has NO control over her life and loves . Everything about her ( especially her voice ) changes between the characters and you always see both inside her at the same time . She also has a few monologues that are fascinating and funny at the same time . Rae Dawn Chong is pretty good in a supporting role - - love her apartment ( check out the posters on the wall ) . Patrick Bauchau is pretty bad in another supporting role - - but not enough to destroy the movie . Direction by Alan Rudolph is great . He bathes many scenes in red lights and I LOVE how the camera moves back and forth during a conversation between Bujold and Carradine . He also wrote the great script . One minor complaint - - Bujold has a few short , dark fantasies which are never explained . What was all that about ? This was a big art house hit back in 1984 and deservedly received a cult following . But it seems to have disappeared since then ( the DVD was released with no fanfare at all ) . Still it's well worth seeing .

208,"Text1: Not entirely effective , but always intriguing little drama One trend in modern cinema that I'm getting sick of seeing lately is this obsession with small scale indie dramas focusing human relations and actions that are always greeted by glowing reviews from every critic and his dog . It's refreshing , therefore , to see one of these dramas that goes beyond the usual sentiment and dull drama and actually delivers something worth watching . While The Woodsman can't be called a masterpiece or even a modern classic , it presents the audience with a scenario that hasn't seen the light of day much in cinema ( for good reason ) , and makes good if it . Many films deal with criminals and crime , and it's often glorified or shown in a favourable light . Even though it's horrible , it's still possible to get behind murderers and drug dealers ; but one type of crime whose perpetrator it's impossible to get behind is sex related crime , and surely the worst kind is the one portrayed in this film ; paedophilia . There isn't a more despicable crime that I can think of , and this film attempts to analyse what happens when one is let out of prison . While not every idea in the film works , there are enough that do to ensure that this is always at least interesting . It takes some guts to take as a role as a sex offender , especially when you'll be believable in the role ; so full marks for guts goes to Kevin Bacon . His performance is what really makes this film . He's evil , but only an in an understated way ; and that makes the horror that lies behind his shy facade even more uncomfortable . He walks a line between insanity and redemption brilliantly , and that helps to make the film what it is . His character is easy to forgive - but his crimes are not , and this puts the audience in an ingenious situation , which is carried off to great effect by director Nicole Kassell . The film seems to have a woman's touch throughout , and it so it came as no surprise to me that the auteur is female . This film's real brilliance is summed up in a scene that sees Kevin Bacon sat on a park bench with a young girl . Everything that the film had been building up to is put into that scene and that helps to make the film what it is . The tagline , "" What's the worst thing you ever did ? "" seems a little inappropriate , as there are some things that really are unforgivable ; but this is a good flick almost completely because of the way that it manipulates the audience and the gripping lead performance .


Text2: Not a dead-loss , but not dead-good either The nineties was a varied decade for cinema , with several trends running concurrently . As such , many films slipped through the net ; thus meaning that there's a lot of nineties films that never became big hits , yet were great nonetheless . When I discovered Dead Again in my TV guide , I was hoping that this film may be one of the aforementioned ' hidden gems ' - but suffice to say , it wasn't . That's not to say that Kenneth Branagh's film is bad , not by any means ; but it has too many problems , which stop it from fulfilling it's potential . The plot is one of those that has every chance of going wrong , given that it takes place across two time periods and features elements such as reincarnation . The plot follows the murder of Margaret Strauss , apparently committed by her husband ; composer Roman Strauss . We then cut to the present , where Los Angeles private detective , Mike Church , takes on the case of a mysterious woman suffering from amnesia . In order to help her regain her memories , Church hires a hypnotist ; and it soon comes to light that the woman's nightmares of the Strauss murder may be more than what they seem . I love films with original and weird plots , which is what attracted me to this one in the first place . The plot here is good ; but it's not handled very well . The way that the film switches back and forward between the two time periods is ham-fisted and doesn't translate to the screen very well . It's also very difficult to really care for any of the characters , as most of the screen time is spent on building up the plot rather than spending time with the characters . The film suffers from a rather dull first half , but it really picks up in the second when the twists start to come into play . My TV guide described the film as Hitchcockian - I wouldn't go that far personally , but the twists do make it enjoyable . The film is , however , very lacking in the substance department . A film with reincarnation at its core really should be making you think ; but this one is more of a straight thriller , so don't expect to have your brain taxed . On the whole , I don't recommend missing this film ; but I don't recommend going out of your way to see it either . Dead Again is a film to be viewed when it's on TV and you need a film to watch .

The priest spends the next 25 years locked in the cell of an insane asylum until fate - in the form of a fraternity prank - intervenes , and he is able to escape . He then picks his way through the student bodies with a pick-axe in hand . Two dull brothers fighting over the same girl then proceed to band together to take him on . For folks attracted by the names proudly displayed on the DVD - Darren McGavin of ' Night Stalker ' fame , Sam Rockwell , and a pre-'C . S . I . ' Jorja Fox - I want to say that their roles are all brief . McGavin barely appears until the climax , when he's then required to give us some critical exposition . Rockwell plays the younger version of McGavin's character , and is limited to flashback sequences . And Fox ( whose part is actually uncredited ) is just around long enough to get stabbed through the skull . I've certainly seen better slashers than this , but I've seen worse as well . It's not all bad : it's played very seriously ( with the exception of the killer's lame admonitions after each kill ) . It has some good moments - such as one involving a statue of Christ on the cross . And it does fulfill slasher requirements by giving us some fairly entertaining gore and doses of female flesh . The silly ending was extremely predictable . However , the killer is played by Charles Cragin as a diminutive chrome-domed albino with hideously dark eyes . This is one creepy killer ( albeit as long as he doesn't have dialog ) who could have used a better vehicle . Overall , it's routine , forgettable stuff , but it may be enough to satisfy some loyal slasher aficionados . I do , however , find it amusing that Ted Clark , who in "" Happy Hell Night "" plays the geeky voyeur Bara , went on to play One-Eye in "" Wrong Turn "" .

"" This movie is based on a Stephen King novel in which mysterious new shopkeeper Leland Gaunt ( Max Von Sydow ) offers each citizen of Castle Rock the item he or she most desires - but there is a heavy price to be paid for these transactions . Local sheriff Alan Pangborn ( Ed Harris ) is soon forced to deal with a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances . Below average for Stephen King cinema : I can see why some people would think it was boring . It plods along without offering genuine scares and forces the viewer to spend time ( yet again ) with a bunch of repulsive losers whose hatred of each other is spooky . I do enjoy the novel and don't believe that this lackluster movie does it justice . There are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen . Von Sydow makes Gaunt much too charming . We're supposed to be SCARED of Gaunt at the right times , not amused by him . I also hate it that the sheriff's primary deputy ( Ray McKinnon ) is written and portrayed as such an annoying , Barney Fife-type moron . Star Ed Harris looks as if he was forced into doing this picture by his agent , but professional that he is , he really sinks his teeth into his dialog . Bonnie Bedelia ( as Pangborn's love interest Polly ) and Amanda Plummer ( in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles ) come the closest to creating characters who are likable . Yet it is also foul and mean-spirited . Although I'll be darned if it didn't feel a little cathartic watching a bunch of unlikable movie characters tear each other to pieces . The climax has some good explosions . I often give movies a better rating than they probably deserve , but in this case I feel I should really be honest and just say : .

The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP , sell it and make even more money for the studio . You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when MTV play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie . This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this "" Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie "" type film makingJennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice . Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade , it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes . There's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and "" flashdancing "" being somehow similar . ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot , dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job . it's kind of like saying that screen writing , novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not But I guess none of this mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie . Actually Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie , JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent looking . Fortunately I sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body . That's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man !

Text2: PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES ( Mario Bava , 1965 ) Italian Version : ; U . S . Version : I had long wanted to watch this solitary foray into sci-fi territory by the great Bava : however , even if the film was released on R1 DVD ( now OOP ) and I had actually owned a copy of the slightly different English-language version ( in Pan-and-Scan ! ) on DivX for some time , I'm glad I waited to catch it for the first time via the Italian original ; just for the sake of comparison , my viewing of the R2 DVD was followed with that of the DivX ? and , for all kinds of reasons , the former blows the latter out of the water ! Anyway , the film itself is a minor classic of the genre though not without its faults : admittedly , the Italian brand of sci-fi cinema hasn't been exactly prolific or impressive ? still , Bava's effort is miles ahead of the ones that I've watched so far . To begin with , something about the English title : the aliens / monsters here are actually more zombies than vampires ( the fact that one never knows who can be trusted also links it with both INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS [ 1956 ] and THE LAST MAN ON EARTH [ 1964 ] ) ; hence , the original title ? TERRORE NELLO SPAZIO , i . e . TERROR IN SPACE ? is preferable , not only because it's more literary but it also lends mystery to the proceedings ( as the threat inherent in the plot line isn't categorized from the get-go ) . Curiously , Ib Melchior is credited as co-screenwriter on both the Italian and English versions ; early on , there's an overuse of nonsensical technical jargon ( which , in hindsight , takes away some of the surprise element from the ending ! ) , but this is thankfully downplayed in the film's latter stages . Of course , this being Bava , the look of the film ? actually similar to FORBIDDEN PLANET ( 1956 ) , it may well have inspired ALIEN ( 1979 ; with which it also shares much of the main theme ) ? is essential , and quite remarkable when considering the low-budget the director had at his disposal : the sets ? economical but undeniably stylish ? are very interesting , as are the various props on display ( that giant skeleton from an earlier civilization discovered on the planet is awesome ) ; while obviously modest , the visual / make-up effects are handled with great care and creativity ; the camera-work features an odd choice of angles mingled with Bava's typical zooms ; the pacing is generally terse but every opportunity to create mood and generate suspense is milked for all it's worth ; ultimately , the film's color scheme is so rich that one is almost tempted to turn off the audio and just allow himself to be immersed in the visuals ! Veteran Barry Sullivan makes for an imposing lead and Norma Bengell is his attractive co-star . Among the more notable sequences are the attack on Sullivan by his ' possessed ' crew ? very effective because it is unexpected ? and also the famous slo-mo rise of the shrouded monsters from their foggy graves . However , we also get a slightly confusing climax ( where the various characters become interchangeable due to their identical space-suits , especially when pursuing one another among the rocks ) ? but this is more than made up for by the double-twist at the end ( the first inspired , once again , by BODY SNATCHERS and the other deliciously chilling ) . As for the differences between the two versions of the film : the English-language edit has new and bland opening / closing shots , while some dialogue is either different or missing entirely ; worst of all here is Kendall Schmidt's horrid electronic score ( which , reportedly , had been added to the film by Orion and wasn't ported onto the R1 DVD ) ; on the other hand , the Italian print contains some minor extended bits ? but it's superior chiefly because of the more natural-sounding dubbing job . The only major complaint I have regarding the R2 DVD is that the audio is rather low ; the supplements are pretty minimal as well ( am I wrong in assuming that this won't be forthcoming as part of the Mario Bava series of R1 DVDs from Anchor Bay ? ) but , thankfully , the video has been recently remastered in anticipation of its screening during the Italian","{""output"": ""NO""}"
214,"Text1: "" Land of the white witch taboo , we no go . "" I was all ready to strap myself in for the ride , but you know what , once the story got going it didn't turn out to be too bad . It reminded me a little of 1949's "" Mighty Joe Young "" without the production values , and quite possibly a more notable cast . The story opens with the ill fated plane flight of a wanted embezzler who escapes the authorities with his ten year old daughter in tow . With a tropical storm raging , the plane goes down in an African jungle . Even though the pilot and his two passengers survive , embezzler Stockwell ( Herbert Rawlinson ) is taking no chances after his cash and jewels are noticed by the flier ; and then there were two . Shortly after getting situated , young Doreen Stockwell goes on a jungle foray and discovers a wounded gorilla . It's left to the viewer's imagination to piece things together as the film fast forwards unannounced to a period some years later when Ray Gorman ( Buster Crabbe ) arrives , curious to discover the facts behind the legend of a ' great white witch ' . His servant Tobo ( Prince Modupe ) lends testimony to the tale of a witch born of a big bird that fell from the sky . Gorman and Tobo go in search of the ' house with wings ' and the missing treasure . Adding intrigue to the adventure is the presence of mercenary Carl Hurst ( Barton MacLane ) , who sets out to follow Gorman and cash in on the treasure trove himself , along with an accomplice named Marie ( Fifi D'Orsay ) . I got a kick out of the scene where Tobo saves Gorman by shooting a leopard about to attack ; Gorman expresses his wonder at Tobo's ability to read the jungle . Tobo's response - "" When you live in jungle all your life , you know these things "" . Yet in the very next scene , Tobo follows Gorman as both swim across a crocodile infested river ! Actually , Tobo's character is handled in rather dignified fashion given the era , when blacks often were portrayed as foils or in subservient roles . Gorman in fact treated his guide with respect and was willing to trust his judgment , and their relationship pretty much got along as equals . The casting coup of the film definitely has to be that of Julie London as the adult white witch Doreen . It was London's first film role , and even though she doesn't sing , she really doesn't have to . It was almost comical to observe her repeated ' I really like you ' conversations with Buster Crabbe's character , who managed to miss all the signals . In that regard , the intrepid explorer was a total klutz . I saw this movie under the title "" Nabonga Gorilla "" , which is a bit curious since Doreen's playmate is called Samson , and the name only shows up in the credits with a different spelling - ' Nbongo ' . There it states that the part of the gorilla was played by Nbongo , though film fans will easily recognize the name of Ray "" Crash "" Corrigan as the man in the monkey suit . In ape circles , Corrigan came to be known by many names , including Zamba , Konga , Bonga , and my personal favorite - White Pongo . I wonder if he got to keep the gorilla costume .


Text2: "" This whole thing is very fishy to me "" . Coming almost directly out of the silent era , "" Murder at Midnight "" might be said to suffer from one of the common complaints of early talkies - the picture more closely resembles a stage play put to film , with the actors and actresses over-enunciating and abruptly deliberate in their mannerism and speech . Getting beyond that though , you have an entertaining mystery given the era , with dead bodies piling up at a rapid pace . I thought it was interesting that when Inspector Taylor ( Robert Elliott ) first arrived at the Kennedy home , he wanted to see the two corpses - the phone call to the police station tipped him . But the second murder was committed while he was there ! Very clever ! By the time it's all over , the body count hits a rather high count of five , and all from within the same house ! The picture uses the old lights out trick , the black gloved hand coming in from off screen , and a couple instances of phone lines being cut , which was a bit of a puzzler , since a phone is still operative near the end of the story . I couldn't help thinking that Charlie Chan might be just around the corner to lend a hand in solving the mystery ; he might have done it without pretty maid Mille ( Alice White ) and butler Lawrence ( Brandon Hurst ) being dispatched - I was sad to see them both go . The biggest surprise though was the revelation of the killer - It's the only time in a movie I've seen where the murderer gives himself away by killing himself ! ! ! Pretty neat wrap up for the Inspector who earned his pay in this one , while his inept subordinate couldn't stop eating peanuts !

215,"Text1: "" Skipper , this isn't gorilla country ! "" Having just watched the Jungle Jim adventure "" The Lost Tribe "" with it's wild gorilla finale , I was a whole lot better prepared for this one with the word ' Gorilla ' actually in the title . Unexpectedly though , the apes were revealed to be men in gorilla suits , in a scheme to loot the lost gold treasure of Shalakari . That didn't fool Jim for very long , as the story mentioned more than once that this particular area of the Nagandi District wasn't gorilla territory . As listed in Johnny Weismuller's film credits , this was his third outing as the jungle hero , and the formula pretty much stays on course here . There's plenty of wild animal stock footage , probably the most and the best of the first three pictures . I was particularly impressed with the tease of a panther / crocodile tussle , even though extremely brief , and of course the lion versus tiger battle could never take place in nature . Which got me further thinking about where Jungle Jim's adventures actually take place . The original "" Jungle Jim "" and "" The Lost Tribe "" are definitely set in Africa ; this one looked like it could have been set in India by the look of the safari hands . In the comic book stories , I have a sense that Jim wound up in India from time to time . To settle the score though , one need only refer to the location of the game preserve mentioned at the start of the story , the Nagandi District . In the first movie , that was in Africa . Other similarities in style to the first two movies include the use of considerable filler , in this one Jungle Jim spends some time spear fishing as a chimp steals his catch , while in a humorous moment , Jim's dog Skipper bites the tail of an intruding lion . His crow Caw-Caw is also on hand , and it's a hoot to hear him called by name by a macaw later in the story . And of course , what would a Jungle Jim film be if he didn't engage in an obligatory underwater battle , this time a giant eel , or go hand to paw with a jungle cat or two . Funny how he never gets clawed or bitten enough to draw blood . One thing struck me as odd though , and it was quite pronounced in this story . Unlike those other comic strip turned cinema heroes of the 1950's like The Lone Ranger and Superman who never intentionally harmed his enemy , Jungle Jim actually tells villain Brandt ( Onslow Stevens ) that he's going to kill him . Granted , he wound up dispatching villains in his other films , but it was never positioned in such a way as to seem premeditated . Sort of takes some of the glow off the whole jungle hero persona , even if the bad guy had it coming .

Text2: Interesting racial undertones evoking the Civil War era , some good special effects , and some OK fight sequences make "" Underworld "" a decent Friday night matinee . . . It was only a matter of time before a film like this was made . Unfortunately , the end result isn't quite as amazing as everyone had hoped it would be . Nevertheless , if you like werewolves and vampires , then "" Underworld "" will probably wet your teeth . For the most part , I found the film an enjoyable enough experience to recommend - - although there are some scenes that seem to slow the film down and add nothing to the story . I was also disappointed in the way that the film pays more attention on keeping its vampires and werewolves in human form , talking for the duration of the film , rarely fighting and evolving into beasts of the night . As Homer Simpson once said , "" Less yakkin ' ; more zappin ' ! "" "" Underworld "" is about a vampire named Selene ( Kate Beckinsale ) who lives in a scary mansion in Europe with dozens of other gothic beasts like herself . They're so busy fighting werewolves , it made me wonder where they all get their stylish leather attire - - it's like a "" Grease "" reunion or something . Selene is a "" hunter "" - - she seeks out werewolves and slaughters them , and this happens in the opening sequence which is pretty "" Matrix "" - esque . The vampires fight them with silver bullets , and the werewolves fight vampires with big teeth . Not much of a challenge for the vampires , eh ? You'd be surprised . With the help of CGI , Selene has trouble fighting the animals . ( They are apparently pretty strong , and apparently a big rip-off of the creatures from "" An American Werewolf in Europe "" and "" Paris . "" ) Werewolves , we learn , used to be slaves to the vampire species , before Lucius - - the head of the werewolves - - fell in love with the vampire "" lord's "" daughter . The latter was killed , and the former escaped , only to form a pack of followers that would battle with vampires over the ages . Now Lucius has targeted a young doctor who has the capability of forming a hybrid between vampires and werewolves . I didn't understand everything regarding how , exactly , this is possible , since I think the explanation is purposefully quick and slurred so that audiences can't stop to evaluate any implausabilities . Selene falls in love with the man and tries to stop Viktor , the lord of the vampires , from killing him . He tells her that the doctor is an abomination - - that vampires and werewolves cannot be mixed together . She doesn't believe him . The film is basically politically-correct . Werewolves used to be slaves , freed themselves , and were still faced with racism until a lone vampire decided that the two species could unite . Doesn't that sound a bit like truth ? Regardless of any implied backdrops , the film will probably satisfy any action fan who is looking for some neat battle sequences and cool special effects . My only problem with the film is probably the fact that the vampires and werewolves never really evolve into vampires or werewolves . We do see some large dogs occasionally , but for the most part it's just people with glowing eyes battling big muscular people who sometimes rip off their clothes and turn into big hairy beasts . But the film is an enjoyable Friday night matineee ; a good movie if you're in the mood for something light and enjoyable . It rips of "" The Matrix "" a bit with its style , but what gothic action film hasn't since 1999 ? Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous here , and worth the price of admission alone . The film isn't too original , and it's not nearly as great as it could have been ( chances are ruined here ) , but it works as a dumb , fun movie . stars . - John Ulmer

Isabella has a problem : motion sickness - she cannot fly , ride in a car , or assume the bottom position during sex or she becomes violently ill ( it seems that the sea goddess compensated her problem by making her an inimitable chef ) . All is well until Toninho has a brief affair that drives the crushed Isabella to move to San Francisco alone despite her love for Toninho . There she moves in with her old friend Monica from Bahia ( Harold Perrineau as a superbly enacted crossed dressed drag queen ) and begins her unsuccessful search for a job . In order to overcome her longing for Toninho and regain her culinary skills she makes a pact with the sea goddess , forsaking ever loving Toninho again . Eventually Isabella lands a TV show on Passionate Cooking when desperate producer Cliff ( Mark Feuerstein ) gets a whiff of her talent . She is an immediate success . Meanwhile Toninho , unable to endure life in Bahia without Isabella , flies to San Francisco and begins a series of Bossa Nova serenades to win her back . Cliff places Toninho on Isabella's show as background music and the ratings soar . But it is the ultimately the conflict resolution between Isabella and Toninho that brings the story to its expected end . The story may be light and the script may be pedestrian , but the direction and camera work suffuse this film with Latin American magical realism and that keeps it lighthearted and fun . Cruz is terrific , Perrineau is the true star of the show displaying a sophisticated and sensitive acting skill that is very special , and Murilo Ben√≠cio is not only a hunk and eye candy but also a fine singer and a warm actor who deserves a lot of attention . Story five , stars six . Have fun with this one ! Grady Harp , March 06


Text2: Night Gallery In "" The Cemetery "" ( . . directed by Boris Sagal ) , a loathsome money-hungry nephew , Jeremy Evans ( Roddy McDowell , playing him as a really slimy scumbag ) ready and willing to horde on his Uncle's inheritance , just waiting for the old timer , William Hendricks ( George Macready ) crippled and ravaged by a stroke that has taken his means of movement and communication , to croak . His Uncle was once a painter obsessed with death . . his works often evoke that . Osmond Portifoy ( Ossie Davis ) has been under employ to the old man for many years and Jeremy relishes in reminding the butler who will be dipping their hands in the money jar . To show you just how virulent Jeremy can be , he points out to Portifoy ( . . and for extra slander , he uses "" Portifoy "" nearly every sentence with a sneer ) how his mother worked her fingers to the bone without ever asking Uncle for a dime and that he always desired to live the good life , but needed the means to do so . McDowell is in command carrying this heavy smell of pomp and greed ( "" I'm a black sheep nephew with an itch "" ) . . you just love to hate him . Jeremy finds out that he'll receive his Uncle's inheritance due to the fact that his mother is dead and her share will go to him thanks to a clause in Hendrick's will . So Jeremy locks his Uncle's wheelchair next to an open window allowing the draft to kill him ( . . while also letting his Uncle peer at the family graveyard as a reminder of where the old man is about be heading ) . Oh , but you know Jeremy's got his comeuppance coming to him , yes sir ! Jeremy notices a painting on the wall ( Hendrick's portraits line the wall of the stairwell ) and the freshly dug grave where dear dead Uncle was buried begins to change every time he looks at it . Watch as Jeremy slowly unravels as he sees Uncle's casket appear , then open , then show someone rising slowly walking to the front door of the manor . But , all is not what it seems . I do think McDowell's tour-de-force performance approaches high camp but I just enjoyed it immensely . . he's such a blood-sucking leech , a real weasel . Watching Jeremy squirm and ultimately become frightened out of his wits was a ton of fun . The ending is a bit silly ( . . and rather logically unsound ) , pointing out another schemer out for a payday , but overall I think it's fun , if derivative somewhat . The idea of the ever-changing portrait is a cool idea , I thought . The second tale , "" Eyes "" ( . . directed by Steven Spielberg ) stars Joan Crawford as an acid-tongued , rich , blind woman , Claudia ( who has built her own apartment complex in New York and lives as it's only tenant ) , who blackmails a surgeon , Dr . Frank Heatherton ( Barry Sullivan ) into performing a dangerous and unorthodox grafting procedure transplanting the central optic nerves of an obsessive gambler's eyes , Sidney ( Tom Bosley of "" Happy Days "" fame ) needing 9 grand to pay off a debt from a bookie threatening his life . Although the procedure will only grant her 11 hours of sight , she's willing to have that for just the precious moments to see color and objects always darkened to her . But , in a nasty bit of irony to match her own behavior towards others like Heatherton , New York City goes through a black out ridding her of those precious moments she has so longed for . This tale has that Rod Serling intellectual banter between characters you remember from stage-like episodes of "" Twilight Zone "" as fates are contemplated and discussions are batted around . This also has the "" coming out "" stylistics of a future filmmaker . The third tale , "" The Escape Route "" ( . . directed by Barry Shear ) follows a Nazi named Strobe ( Richard Kiley , with a scar covering one eye for extra impact ) hiding away in South Africa , haunted by memories of his war crimes and constantly looking over his shoulder worried about being caught by agents who specialize in hunting "" his kind "" out . He becomes pre-occupied / transfixed with a museum painting of some fisherman on a mountain lake","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The movie has a Russian boxer coming to America to take on any challenger bold enough to go head to head with him . For some reason , this infuriates Apollo and he is the one to challenge the Russian .

Text2: Arguably the funniest episode . In my admittedly warped opinion , this is about as good as situation comedy gets . Al wants to become famous in the world of shoes , and Kelly's assignment from the Larry Storch School of Acting is to shoot a movie . The two combine their lack of skills and make a movie about shoes . They misspell the title , which comes out "" SHEOS . "" The movie is shown at the Hammond , Indiana , Film Festival before an audience of egghead film buffs , plus a hissing and booing Marcy . The film is only three minutes long , and it stinks to high heaven . "" Sheos "" is in cheap black and white and tells the story of the things that animals have put on their feet since emerging from the primordial ooze ( a tiny plastic swimming pool in the Bundy's back yard ) . Al's narration informs us that the cave men tried various kinds of foot gear , and we see his feet walking on sticks , on Teflon frying pans , and on plastic inflatable women . A cut to a parody of Michelangelo's "" Creation "" from the Sistine Chapel , showing Al as God , passing on to Kelly's outstretched hand a woman's shoe . The narration tells us that no one knows what will happen next because we're all waiting for the next shoe to drop . A shot of Al on his lounge chair . He utters the word "" Rosebud , "" then dies and a shoe drops from his hand to the lawn . The screen cuts to "" FIN "" . The audience goes wild . Al and Kelly win a $10 , 000 grant from the National Endowment of the Arts and shoot another movie , "" A Day in the Life of a Shoe Salesman , "" which has some equally hilarious moments but a description of which is precluded by considerations of space . You can't help wondering how much of the humor in this episode is going to get past the coveted younger audience . They don't get to see Kelly's belly button , for instance . And many of the laughs hang on access to what used to be a shared cultural data base . I guess you don't have to recognize the parody of Michelangelo's painting , but you lose half the humor if you don't . And you don't have to know Richard Strauss composed the theme song , but unless you've seen "" 2001 : A Space Odyssey , "" you miss half the humor . ( Lots of kids don't watch "" old movies "" , and Kubrik's "" 2001 "" came out in 1968 , before they were born . ) When "" FIN "" appears on the screen , how many kids will think "" fish "" ?

This one starts out ( in the American version anyway ) , basically combining the two battles between Godzilla and MechaGodzilla from the previous movie while editing out the stupid furry monster . The aliens have rebuilt MechaGodzilla and with the help of a scientist have gained the help of another monster called Titanasaurous ( I know that is probably spelled wrong ) . Of course you know there is going to be a big battle with these two going against a solo Godzilla . There is also a subplot involving some guy in love with the scientist's daughter and a weapon designed to hurt the dinosaur with the hard to spell name . The battle is pretty good in this one , cause this time there is no stupid monster to help Godzilla and steal the glory like the dumb fuzzy monster in this one .

It actually started promisingly with an opening scene of sewage workers sifting through sludge finding something weird , but after that five minutes it is the typical full moon movie , little creatures , dumb human characters and an emphasis on comedy rather than horror . The dumb story revolves around this two guys who collect medical oddities , the latest one comes to life and brings other things to life , we are never told how or why , and frankly we don't care anyway .

Saddled with a loose cannon accomplice who also has a weakling brother , Ritchie ends up taking hostages . However , he quickly finds out that someone is onto them - not the cops , but a sadistic bad guy with control of the building . Be prepared for some very juicy gore in this high-energy , outrageous , sometimes farcical trashy movie . I saw another user comment that refers to it as "" splatstick "" , which is an apt and hilarious way of putting it . Ridiculous situations are in plentiful supply , and the actors play it for all it's worth . Dorff is fun as a guy who comes off as a hapless schmuck at first , but ultimately proves to be efficient at dealing with his insane predicament . Jaime Murray is quite sexy as Anna , and Hugh O'Conor and Geoff Bell regularly steal all of their scenes as , respectively , Dmitry and Boris . Edward Baker Duly is downright campy , not in the least really menacing , but still pretty entertaining , as the flamboyant killer . This engaging bit of nonsense is packed to the brim with fine set pieces , delivered with gusto by first-time director Kit Ryan . The morbid humor is positively gut-busting , and it rates as a certifiably nutty and nasty bit of non-think entertainment .

There's a special vicious strike when he draws his cutting blade diving into the mod hookers before discarding them like garbage ( one girl he drives her car into a ditch while another he tosses her carcass into the river ) . Scotland Yard focus their attention on troubled actor Richard Sand ( Hansj√∂rg Felmy ) , whose past yields a stint with drug addiction and at present is struggling with bad nerves . . he portrays Jack the Ripper in a stage production of the killer .

Michael ( Dietmar Sch√∂nherr ) , a man in love with Ann having grown up with her after "" his father died "" , is good friends with Richard . All these melodramatic complications only add to poor Richard's troubles as he feels the investigation breathing down his neck and a desire to quit the Ripper character who is slowly wearing him out . The film also has Teddy ( Peer Schmidt ) and his assistant as this moronic sleuthing team hoping to catch the Ripper so they can become famous making a name for their amateur detective agency , but always come up short of that goal despite being so close . Ann suspects her Uncle after catching him whisking off one night and decides to conduct a little investigation of her own . The mystery , as explained by two other users , is not too hard to figure out which does take away from the overall appeal of this atmospherically made low-budget thriller . I loved how the director shoots the Ripper and his killing methods , not exactly displaying the cutting , but getting the grisly display over by showing how he conducts himself so thoroughly . Still , a good mystery should make the identity of the psycho a bit harder to figure out . . and , it isn't too hard in this flick's case . I think it's well crafted , but the screenplay is lacking . I like how the film feels authentic instead of stage-bound . . I think that adds to the mood of it . Even if the film may not actually take place in London , Berlin sure looks a lot like the British city and that's certainly a benefit as far as I'm concerned . Director Zbonek likes to shoot action from afar , even when the Ripper does his dirty business , lensing those desolate quiet streets where no one can help those unfortunate females needing assistance where there is none . But , stylish direction can only carry you so far and the story itself isn't anything to write home about . . even after we get an explanation of why the killer committed his heinous acts .


Text2: Room 6 Amy Roberts ( Christine Taylor ) is having recurring nightmares where a surgeon and staff are about to make an incision while she's still awake , and the faces and event are so real . Boyfriend Nick ( Shane Brolly ) finally pops the big question but she's late for work , and this unresolved answer ( . . if she'll marry him ) will have to wait until after school ( . . she's a school teacher ) . Amy is incredibly afraid of hospitals and this fear derives from a tragic incident when she was a child regarding the death of her pops . A child plagued with terrifying nightmares , Melissa Norman ( Chloe Moretz ) , in her class might have the answer to halt the dreams tormenting Amy . . Melissa's artistic renderings of those nightmarish faces troubles Amy , demonic and grotesque . After school , Amy and Nick are driving home when a truck smashes into their SUV causing a massive collision . . left with a broken leg , Nick is taken away by rude , inhospitable paramedics and Amy left concerned about which hospital he would be going . Lucas Dylan ( Jerry O'Connell ) , the other driver , whose sister is also hurt and taken to a hospital of unknown origin , will accompany Amy as they search for the whereabouts of their loved ones . Meanwhile , Amy begins seeing demonic faces of her own , many carrying an exact likeness to those horrifying drawings painted by Melissa . We also follow Nick , who is trapped in a hospital with a weird , intimidating staff , and nervous , frightened patients who are reluctant to answer his probing questions about the mysterious behavior of those in charge of their well being . I'm in the minority regarding this movie , because I thought it was an unsettling , rather creepy little demonic thriller , with terrific make-up effects from Robert Hall and his Almost Human team . I thought the demons were genuinely frightening , and provide a real sense of dread as Amy confronts opposing forces who want her soul . The Rosemary's Hospital is quite a spooky setting and it's back story heightens the terror , while also providing answers to what Amy is up against . . a battle , or test , facing a past decision regarding her father's death that has lingered over the years , and overcoming this by confronting it will be the only way of escaping those who desire for her to "" join them . "" The theme is really traditional "" good vs evil "" subject matter with Amy's soul hanging in the balance . Renowned camera operator Raymond Stella learned a lot from working with Dean Cundy , as cinematographer really creating a disquieting atmosphere within the hospital ( . . the way the lights flicker on and off ; how disconcerting , empty , and dark the halls are ) . Within the film , Amy does have help ( . . ambiguously presented by certain characters who somehow know her name , like the taxi driver ) in discovering the history of Rosemary's hospital in pursuit of saving Nick , while the evil forces always try to thwart her mission . Nick also finds himself pitted against the forces of darkness , trying to uncover the mystery behind the hospital he's stuck in , while also attempting to understand the aggressive and off-putting nature of the staff . Why do they take so much blood , and where are they when he needs them ? Director Michael Hurst creates a state of unease for Amy and from the moment she leaves the wreck , the film remains surreal and strange , a world in purgatory as she attempts to find Nick , a spiritual struggle to the very end . Flashy role for Ellie Cornell ( Halloween IV ) as a disgruntled , acid-tongued white trash mother of Melissa who doesn't appreciate Amy's attempts at "" headshrinking "" her daughter . Kane Hodder has a terrific cameo as a bum who attempts to attack Amy , and gets into a violent scuffle with Lucas . O'Connel , as Lucas , is able to create an air of mystery despite conveying a very comforting and supportive friend to Amy , who certainly needs one . The climax in the hospital is a doozy , particularly when Amy must face the spirits of burn victims and killer nurses after her as she searches for Nick . The computer effects aren't as effective as the make-up prosthetic work , but I felt they aren't a really heavy burden on the movie overall . Cool factoid","{""output"": ""YES""}"
224,"Text1: THE SIN OF HAROLD DIDDLEBOCK ( Preston Sturges , 1947 ) An interesting if ultimately unsuccessful combination of two clashing comedy styles ( overseen by humorless mogul Howard Hughes no less ) , this film turned out to be Harold Lloyd's swan-song - and , as such , it ended on a somewhat positive note ( even though the film was made during Sturges ' period of decline ) . It opens with a reprise of the climactic football game from one of Lloyd's greatest successes , THE FRESHMAN ( 1925 ) , eventually bringing that same character ( albeit renamed ! ) up to date . Still , in the end , the film is more Sturges than Lloyd : even if the star plays one of his trademark roles of a patsy ( though not without the occasional display of ingenuity ) , there is little of the star's characteristic slapstick here . Instead , the comedy is in Sturges ' typical frantic ( and , mainly , dialogue-driven ) style - with which Lloyd isn't entirely comfortable ; the film also features Sturges ' stock company of character players in full swing . That said , it's climaxed by yet another of the star comedian's thrilling set-pieces which finds him overhanging from a building-ledge - hampered this time around by a myopic Jimmy Conlin and an understandably disgruntled circus lion ! While a disappointing whole ( it was re-issued in 1950 in a shortened version renamed MAD Wednesday ) , the film does contain a number of undeniable gems : his romantic attachment to every female member of one particular family ( all of whom happen to work for the same firm over a 20-year period ) ; his first encounter with Conlin , with the two of them exchanging wise sayings ( the optimistic Lloyd had kept a handful nailed to the wall behind him at his former workplace ) in order to explain their current dejected state-of-mind ; and , best of all , the unforgettable scene in which Lloyd takes his first alcoholic beverage ( an impromptu concoction by bartender Edgar Kennedy and which he names "" The Diddlebock "" ) that invariably provokes an unexpected yet hilarious reaction .

Despite the modern trappings ( street-smart attitude , rap music , excessive foul language ) , the film is distinctly old-fashioned ‚Äì in a good way ‚Äì in its characters‚Äô moral codes and plot development .

Of course , this connection is tenuous at best ( since the Huston film has much more scope , whereas this is mostly confined to its apartment-building setting ) ‚Äì but director Hill , or the surprising writer / producer team of Robert Zemeckis ( ! ) and Bob Gale , may well have looked at the earlier classic for inspiration .

Text2: A Nutshell Review : Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging I guess Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging is the female equivalent of the teenage male sex comedies , without the sex or gratuitous nudity that is , because this is firmly in chick lit territory and based upon two books written by Louise Rennison - Angus , Thongs and Full - Frontal Snogging and On the Bright Side , I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God . If you may , this aligns itself more toward Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole series , where we get a glimpse of the titular character's daily life and anxieties through episodes of growing pains . Directed by Gurinder Chadha who brought us Bride & Prejudice and Bend It Like Beckham , this movie centres upon 14 year old Georgia Nicholson ( Georgia Groome ) and her three girly pals whom Jas ( Eleanor Tomlinson ) is her best pal of the lot . Both have major infatuations with new boys in school Robbie ( Aaron Johnson ) and Tom ( Sean Bourke ) , and naturally jealousy ensues when Jas manages to hook up with Tom , but for Georgia , she's stuck with having to battle for Robbie's affections with rival Wet Lindsay ( Kimberley Nixon , last seen in Wild Child ) , who's the school's flower with cover girl looks . And while "" boylingual issues "" occupy the bulk of Georgia's time , she also has major freak - outs with trying to figure how to throw the most memorable birthday party ever , as well as trying to save her own family from disintegrating , with Dad ( Alan Davies ) being sent to New Zealand because of a major promotion at work , and Mom ( Karen Taylor ) seems to be having a flirty good time with their home interior decorator . It's quite a ditzy film and I guess for all the girls out there , the events as they unfold in the movie will probably be easily identifiable , and I guess the boys too will have a field day with some of the situational humour which came by the bucketloads . And what I thought to be really quite accurate , is the way how everyone second guesses each other when it comes to the affairs of the hearts , and sometimes dwell onto stuff a little too much to the extreme , incessantly finding meaning in something as simple as a word or phrase . This naturally brings out the ugliness that stem from desperation , and we observe how Georgia slowly degenerates from nice girl next door , to uber Ms Insensitive . It's a fairly light and breezy chick flick that is peppered by some insane characters , such as Georgia's sister who thinks that she's a cat , and probably who I thought to be one of the most innovative fellas out there who would outplay , outlast and outwit the likes of Stifler and McLovin , is Peter Dyer , the self-professed expert who offers lessons and opportunity in allowing girls to experiment in achieving the perfect snog . Talk about being sly ! Ultimately , this is a feel good movie which has all its loose threads tied up very conveniently , which you could see coming from a mile away . But it doesn't dwell on its problems for too long , because there's always a solution that springs up for Georgia and gang to tap on . Peppered by some good music in the soundtrack , and generally likable characters who remind all of us of some dreaded issues when growing up , Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging is a surprisingly well designed teenage comedy that doesn't have to rely on cheap gimmicks like incessant foul language , sex and nudity to draw the crowds . And for that quality , this is somewhat refreshing for comedies targeted at that demographics . I might go one step further and say I won't mind ploughing through the books as well !

It is extremely odd , vicious and disturbing , so fans of bizarre cinema won't be disappointed . My favourite segment from "" Subconscious Cruelty "" is "" Human Larvae "" which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister . The birthing scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten . The last segment "" Right Brain / Martyrdom "" has to be seen to be believed . It's incredibly harsh and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and grisly torture . We see Jesus Christ captured by three naked females who mutilate him , ripping flesh from his chest , licking a wound on his knee and pissing on him . There is also a Jesus statue with a projection of a swastika on it . "" Subconscious Cruelty "" is a truly memorable film that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema . Check it out .

Hindsight displays a certain charm : the director is not Marcel Carn√© or Jean Delannoy / Jean Cocteau , but he can create an atmosphere . Hr is abetted by a good cast . More than the young leads ( Madeleine Sologne and Michel Marsay , whose career was short-lived ) , it's the old guard who saves the film : Gabrielle Dorziat is as excellent as ever , Pierre REnoir is sinister-looking , Marcelle G√©niat is no longer the nice old lady but a deaf and dumb disturbing servant . There's a curse on the Malveneur family . There's a black legend which tells that one of their ancestors sold his soul to the devil and he was cursed : man by day , wolf by night . These doomed aristocrats were hunters , hence their name ( Malveneur = evil venerer ) . But it also rhymes with "" Malheur "" ( = misfortune ) . The Last of the Malveneur is a scientist who carries out strange experiments on . . . nobody knows exactly what the does in the subterranean . Up comes a governess who ' s got to take care of the master's daughter . The wife has a heart condition , her sister-in-law is a masculine authoritarian lady . And nights in the old castle are not exactly peaceful . Based on Conan Doyle's "" Hound Of Baskerville's pattern , the script lacks focus and the writers can spare 2 or 3 contradictions : for instance , the Malveneur are outcast , they must not be buried in the cemetery , a consecrated place ; however they ( or at least the sister-in-law and her niece ) go to church on Sunday ! There's a laudable attempt to link the legend with the last of the Malveneur's fate and , all in all , it's not that much bad after all .

228,"Text1: I Wasn't Impressed THE UNTOUCHABLES came out in an explosion of acclaim in 1987 with the critics hailing it as "" a masterpiece "" and "" An instant classic "" but after seeing the movie I was wondering if I'd been watching the same movie . My own theory as to why so many cynical movie critics liked it might have had something to do with the very poor standard of movies in the mid to late 80s which seemed to involve either teenagers getting killed in a variety of gruesome ways or a couple of well dressed cops pointing their guns while the billboard hot one hundred plays in the background . Off the top of my head I can think of only one movie from the same period that deserved much praise and that was PLATOON It could also be remembered that THE UNTOUCHABLES has a great cast list with DeNiro , Connery and a couple of rising stars in Kevin Costner and Andy Garcia , but the screenplay fails to focus on any one character . You do get the impression that it has been re-written to death in order to accommodate the big name stars . Personally I thought Capone should have been the main protagonist with Ness in the background with tough wily Irish cop Malone absent altogether . Maybe that was the intention with the original script but it had been changed with the casting coup involved ? Sticking one or two factual elements into the story would have helped too The more De Palma movies I see the more repetitive his directing techniques become . Long panning shots , slow motion sequences featuring bloody deaths . It was good in CARRIE but had become old hat hereOh and if it was such a great 1987 release how come it didn't get a massive load of Oscar nominations ?


Text2: A death in the family The disturbing opening scene is a nightmare that Rocco Giuranna is having . The rats that are scavenging a trash site seem to herald what he and his two brothers will face as the three come together because the death of their mother . Rocco is a social worker living in a state reformatory where he is in charge of young boys that are in the institution to be re-educated . Unfortunately , they will probably will go to be hard criminals when they are released from the Naples correctional facility . Raffaele , the older brother , is a judge in Rome . He has been asked to preside over an important case coming to trial that involves local terrorists . Italy was living harsh days at the time and judges were the target for paid assassins or revolutionaries with an agenda for eliminating those that dared to speak against them . The upcoming trial has a profound effect on Raffaele's wife , who knows it probably means the death of her husband . The third brother , Nicola , is a factory worker . Like his brothers , he fled the poor South of Italy in search for a better future in Torino . What he finds is unhappiness as he rebels against the firm he feels is enslaving him and his co-workers . His marriage has suffered because his wife has cheated on him and they are separated . It is at this junction that all three brothers are summoned to come home as their mother has died . Donato , the older father , is lost , as he ponders what is going to become of him . His memories of happier times , with the woman he adored , keep flooding back to him as his three sons come home to mourn for their loss . The three brothers , in turn , are haunted by their own memories of their present lives and their youth in the small town in Puglia before they left home . Francesco Rosi , adapted Andrei Platonov's novel "" The Third Son "" , together with Tonino Guerra , one of the best writers in the Italian cinema . Mr . Rosi , a director who shows an affinity for presenting ordinary people in difficult situations in their lives , scored a big success with this film . He knows these characters . The director makes an enormous contribution in the way he deals with the emotions of the principals in this film about the love of the land , on the one hand of Donato , the father , and the restlessness of the three sons that abandoned their birth place in search of a better living . Rosi's triumph is in showing us that ultimately , it's Donato , the father , the one that stayed behind who is the one that lived a better life than their three sons . The director achieves a triumph in the way he directed the four principals in the film . Philippe Noiret , Michele Placido , and Vittorio Mezzogiorno do an excellent job in bringing to life , Raffaele , Nicola and Rocco . It is however Charles Vanel , the veteran French actor who stays with the viewer because of his exquisite portrayal of the older Donato . Mr . Vanel hardly utters a word throughout the movie , yet , his presence is so powerful that at times one tends to forget the others . Mr . Vanel's Donato is one of the best creations in his long film career in France . Pasqualino DiSantis ' cinematography captures the essence of what Francesco Rosi was looking for . The director and his photographer were well attuned indeed . Ruggero Mastroianni's film editing shows once more his elegant style of putting the material together . Francesco Rosi is the one that brought all the elements together in this dramatic and satisfactory film .

229,"Text1: Very deep and intense When I first saw this movie I hated the bad guys so much I walked out of the theatre angry . This is a good thing by-the-way . Not only are the bad guys repellent creeps they are also , in a way , pretty ordinary . You'll never look at a complete stranger the same way again . I thought Nic Cage did a very good job of portraying a squeaky-clean private eye Tom Welles ( he's just so innocent looking ) descending into the world of hardcore pornography and unknowingly letting it change him . Joaquin Phoenix plays wanna-be musician Max California who is also Welles ' sidekick . I'd never really seen him in any movies before this but now that I've seen him in a likable role , in a movie where there are very few likable characters , I look forward to his next movies . Some parts of this film to me are very disturbing , for example the first viewing of the snuff film where we see the girl cry or finale with the jumping record . Joel Schumacher certainly has redeemed himself over Batman and Robin ( shudder ) and should stop being the victim of nasty criticism by critics who are rubbishing this brilliant film only because Batman and Robin was terrible . If you like your thriller movies to be deep , intense and nerve-racking then watch this movie . In case you didn't know the movie was originally about 3 hours long and an alternate ending had Welles kill himself by driving into a wall .


Text2: Curious ' end ' to the Next Gen series The longest in production , the lowest grossing and most limbo-bound Star Trek movie of all . Nemesis is neither here nor there . It entertains without satisfying and features loads of brilliant SFX , but little awe . Perhaps we are all just too familiar with franchise and it needs to forever be increasingly far-reaching to keep it fresh . However , it IS a lot better than Insurrection . In terms of direction anyway . Jonothan Frake's TV movie approach to the franchise lacked any sort of class or sophistication but Stuart Baird fixes that with a darker and more menacing tone . The script is more sinister than that of Insurrection or First Contact ( the Next Gen movie titles still remain uninspired ) but what ends up in the film is confused and undefined . The plot has Picard sent out to Romulous to help make peace with the new Preator , a man who calls himself Shinzon and who happens to be an exact clone of Picard . Data finds an android identical to himself buried in the sand of a nearby desert planet . Picard and Data are suspicious of their radical finds and the suspicion soon proves to be justified as treachery and double-crosses are revealed . With an unconfirmed amount of deleted scenes ( rumors put it around the 50 minute mark ) it's painfully obvious that important plot developments have been cut out of the film . The sense of the Enterprise emptying as all the main characters leave for new career paths is lost . Worf and Crusher are hardly featured for some reason . The relationship between Data and his long-lost brother B-4 seems very thin . The sub-text is muddled and hard to get to grips with . And a sub-plot involving Praetor Shinzon's lust ( and subsequent repeated rape ) for Deanna Troi is abandoned as soon as it starts . What was the point of starting it in the first place ? Is B-4 actually Data's evil brother Lore ? And despite the fact that Star Trek has been around for almost 40 years at this point , the STILL do the cheap ' desert outside of LA as some other planet ' trick . And the dune buggies seemed to be kind of out of place . Like it was just added in at the last minute to make the film more exciting . Shinzon is not the slightest bit scary and even looks like the 3rd place runner-up in a Right Said Fred lookalike competition . For all the talk of him looking slightly different from Picard due to his life of hardship , he didn't look very hard . Also , Jerry Goldsmith's score just seems like loads of his previous scores with some cues altered slightly . Honestly , I recognised several cues from Executive Decision , Gremlins 2 , The ' Burbs and many other movies changed just a little bit to make it sound different . Though I understand Goldsmith was very ill at this point so I can forgive him for that . But it's hard to forgive the rest of the film . Like I said , it's entertaining , but falls apart under even the most superficial of scrutiny . It could have been handled a lot better and I'm surprised and disappointed that Paramount fumbled their flagship series so badly .

230,"Text1: A Deeply , Deeply Scary Movie I don't know that I've ever been more scared on a purely gut level by any horror film as much as I was by Tobe Hooper's grisly 1974 cult classic . The current batch of torture porn crap passing as horror films obviously owe much to this film , and they've borrowed certain characteristics wholesale : the fetid , rotten production design ; the fixation on human dismemberment and carnage ; the depiction of rural Americans as psychotic , deformed cannibals . But the original "" Texas Chain Saw Massacre "" is better than just about every modern-day horror film in just about every way . Advanced technology has allowed horror-brat directors like Eli Roth and Alexandre Aja to show the destruction of a human body in literal and painstaking detail , but they have no idea how to actually scare an audience . Hooper , by contrast , uses actual skill to suggest much more than he actually shows , and if you think about this film afterwards , you'll realize that there is very little bloodshed . The violence in this film is actually somewhat understated , and it's all the more terrifying for that . I will never forget the first appearance of Leatherface , who thumps a guy on the head with a mallet and drags him down to his lab with all the nonchalance of a butcher readying a slab of meat for sale . Eli Roth would have focused all of his attention on the impact of the mallet with the skull - - we probably would have been treated to an image of the skull caving in and blood splattering the walls . Hooper , instead , understands that it's the casual nature of the killing that's most disturbing - - not the bloodshed - - and that's what he shows . Hooper decided to make his movie about frightening situations rather than graphic gore and as a result created a small horror masterpiece .


Text2: Bogart and Hepburn ? An Unlikely Jungle Romance Who would have thought that Humphrey Bogart , known for playing brooding tough guys ; Katharine Hepburn , known for playing strong-willed and ever-so-distant females ; and John Huston , a man's man director , could put together such a light-hearted , screwball comedy ? But that's exactly what happens with "" The African Queen . "" Bogart stepped way out of his usual screen persona to play this comical , grizzled character ; Hepburn launched the phase of her career that would find her playing uptight spinsters . I never would have thought they'd have any chemistry together , let alone produce even the palest of sexual sparks , but they're as natural a screen pair as either of them was separately with their respective frequent film partners . This adventure romance finds Hepburn's straight-laced missionary and Bogart's unkempt river-boat captain winding their way through the African wilderness . They do all the things you would expect them to do in a movie like this , but what they do best is bicker , down to the very last scene , where their bickering continues even as they are rescued and the final credits roll . According to film annals , Huston hadn't set out to make a comedy , but when he realized how much chemistry his two stars had , he changed gears and made a different movie than was originally intended . Thank God for that - - I'm not a big fan of Huston or his heavy-handed touch as a director , so I'm glad Bogart and Hepburn forced him to lighten up .

Purple Rain not only broke boundaries , it set a decade , the costumes , the music , the behavior , and the dancing ! To this day , my friends and I still jam to the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend to be Prince and the Revolution . Now the movie itself , I just meant what I said in the title , because for the most part , this movie itself is made by the music . The acting ? Please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures , because I know that it was not Oscar worthy by any means . But I think the duo that took this movie was Morris and Jarome , their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious . I just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because I felt that it was what made the movie . Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music . While the movie and acting is pretty bad , this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too . This movie defined the 80's , so just have fun with it .

Text2: Pardon me , guv'nor . Another "" lost "" film that was merely mislaid . I viewed a print of ' Capital Punishment ' restored by the Library of Congress from several source prints , including a nitrate release print that had been tinted : because this monochrome acetate print did not reproduce the tinting , some subtle grey tones were lost . When George Hackathorne cries in one scene , his tears in this print are so dark that I checked to make sure he wasn't wearing mascara . ' Capital Punishment ' is now deemed a Clara Bow vehicle , since she's the only cast member whose name is still remembered . Less than a month before ' Capital Punishment ' was released , Bow had attracted major attention in a supporting role in ' Black Oxen ' ; as a result , B . P . Schulberg ( producer of ' Capital Punishment ' ) radically revised his publicity campaign to imply that Bow is the star of this film . Although Bow is quite good in the female lead , her role and her screen time are very definitely subsidiary to George Hackathorne's as her boyfriend . Hackathorne gives an astonishing performance here , leading me to wonder why he never had a bigger career . ( Maybe it's down to his disconcerting resemblance to Stan Laurel . ) There are also fine performances by Wade Boteler as a helpful cop and by Fred Warren ; the latter convincingly expresses a wide range of emotions in his two brief scenes . This movie has the same premise as Fritz Lang's last American film , ' Beyond a Reasonable Doubt ' . In both films , a self-appointed crusader hopes to abolish capital punishment by persuading a confederate to allow himself to be falsely convicted for murder and sentenced to death , at which point the crusader intends to come forward with proof that the convicted man is actually innocent . . . before the sentence can be carried out . In both films , of course , the plan goes agley . But this movie takes its plot line in a direction utterly different from Lang's ( and without the twist ending that weakened Lang's film ) . Schulberg quite openly meant ' Capital Punishment ' as a propaganda piece against the death penalty . However , he queered his own pitch by inserting a prologue which is deeply contrived . A young man on Death Row ( Eddie Phillips ) swears his innocence as he's led to the electric chair . Elsewhere , the real murderer makes a deathbed confession , provoking a race against the clock for the governor's pardon . . . but the governor's phone call doesn't arrive in time to save the youth . ( Insert moral here . ) How incredibly convenient that the confession comes at the most suspenseful moment , rather than a day earlier or later ! Still , I was intrigued by some stark Expressionist camera set-ups in this sequence , which reminded me of Fritz Lang's films . . . and I know of no higher praise . But James P Hogan was a lacklustre director , so I have difficulty believing that he deserves the credit for these set-ups . Also , I was surprised to see the phrase ' some damned pest ' in a dialogue title during this pre-Hays Office sequence . IMDb correctly credits this film's script to John F Goodrich , but also credits him with the cinematography : no ; that was done by JOSEPH Goodrich : I don't know if they were related . There's a continuity error in the film : we see a close-up of Hackathorne's wrist with a handcuff already slipped out of his sleeve , then in the NEXT shot we see the moment when the handcuff slips out . The production design is excellent throughout . Bow , playing a working-class young woman , wears dowdy clothes and make-up appropriate to that role rather than a glamour treatment . The scenes featuring wealthy characters are appropriately swank . I was distressed by a fantasy sequence , apparently meant to be funny , in which Hackathorne's character envisions himself wealthy : he and his mother and Bow are dressed in finery and attended by footmen , yet they still exhibit lower-class table manners . Elsewhere , in an implausible reality sequence , Bow ponces into the governor's office in a manner implying that anybody can just walk in on the governor any old time . SPOILERS COMING .

232,"Text1: He Stinks ! ( Some Spoilers ) What seems like a hastily made Hollywood propaganda movie about the Japaneses entrance into WWII against the USA , via the attack on Pearl Harbor . If you noticed the time sequence there was no war between the US and Japan but only the war between Rick Leland , Humphrey Bogart , and a gang of Japanese spies and houseboys , who were really Japanese soldiers in disguise , with the attack on Pearl Harbor never even mentioned . In fact the movie seems to have ended in the early morning hours of December 7 , 1941 Panama time something like eight hours before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor actually happened . Capt . Richard "" Rick "" Leland is drummed out of the US Army at the beginning of the film "" Across the Pacific "" for larceny and after being rejected in joining the Canadean military . Rick takes a Japanese freighter , the Gena Mara , to the US controlled Panama Canal Zone where he just happened to have been stationed at for four years . It doesn't take much to figure out that Rick is actually a spy for the USA using his current situation , of being a disgruntled ex-US Army officer , in the US military to throw off the sneaky Jap's into thinking he's ready to sell out his country that he served all these years . It's when the Genoa Maru docks at New York Harbor that we get the lowdown to Rick's real objective but it was very obvious to us well before that . What's really a mystery in "" Across the Pacific "" is just who passenger Alberta Marlow , Mary Astor , is working with , if anyone at all , on the boat the US or the Japanese ? The big guy who's a fanatical supporter of the Japanese and their plans for expansion in the Pacafic is non other then the "" Fat Man "" himself Dr . Lorenz , Sydney Geenstreet . Rick having saved Dr . Lorenz from being killed by a Filipino assassin got the doc to become very friendly with him and let him in on what he , and his Japanese cohorts , are planing ; to bomb and bottle up the Panama Canal Zone thus keeping the US Atlantic Fleet from reinforcing the Pacific Fleet in the event of a war between America and Japan . Rick goes from a spy to an action hero in the end of the film by shooting it out with the Jap's and preventing the Japanese torpedo plane , that was secretly assembled in Panama by the undercover Japanese houseboys . This is all done by Rick in order to prevent the Japanese from bombing the locks in the Panama Canal . To Rick's surprise , and relief , Alberta had nothing to do with the Japanese saboteurs and it turned that her dad the dead drunk Dan Morton ( Monte Blue ) , who the Jap's were using his plantation to get their personnel into Panama . Dan wired Alberta to come to his aid since he was sinking , in a bottle of rum , fast and no longer able to run his place effectively . Besides Dr . Lorenz one of the top Jap spies was a two generation Japanese-America the well-spoken , in English , and collegiate looking Joe Tolsuiiko , Sen Young , which by watching the movie now gives you the impression that there were many Japanese-Americans living in the US involved in spying on the US and working for their "" fatherland "" against their adopted county which was anything but the truth . It seemed that all the action in the movie was going on when both Japan and the United States were technically at peace , before Sunday 7AM December 7 , 1941 Hawaii time . All this made the film a bit odd by realizing that the war-like action was happening before the first Japanese bombs , and torpedoes , struck the Pacific Fleet docked at Pearl Harbor .

So thinking of that , I went to YouTube and I finally managed to watch "" Play It Again , Charlie Brown "" in its entirety . How giddy I was to at last see Lucy try to constantly show how much she loves Schroeder even though he only lives to play Beethoven on his toy piano .

237,"Text1: life on the front-lines , by way of Al-Jezeera , and the American invasion of Iraq Let's face facts folks , especially at this point if not the should-have-been start : American invaded a country that had nothing to do with . This isn't the core message of Control Room , but it's certainly all encompassing for what Jehane Noujaim wants to say in her documentary Control Room . The argument could be made - and of course has - that Al Jezeera is a militant television network playing to an Arab base , that it shows people damning America all the time and praising Alah and so on and so forth . For the latter I can't say how much is truly shown , even by the documentary's scope . But for the former , the context can't be taken lightly : whether or not it is propagandistic isn't quite the point . When a country gets attacked by another country , it's hard to continue to find praise for the offensive side ( and , as we see later in the film , Al-Jezeera was attacked by American planes specifically ) . Is her perspective meant to show bias ? Maybe , maybe not . It's there in plain sight , how much to s things went following the American invasion , and yet side has to be taken into question , media , military , civilian . There's plenty of questions to ask by the end of the film , even in a form that isn't with the best production values or the firmest visual hold . Control Room is also terrifying in hindsight - if this is where we were at in going into Iraq ( I saw this film in cinemas as the time one week before Fahrenheit was released ) , what about today ? It might be even more intriguing to see a follow-up documentary to Control Room , where one sees what has happened some half a decade ( and deceased hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives later and thousands of Americans ) down the line . But for now , it's a story set in the midst of a conflict established by the Americans to get Sadaam Hussein out of power - and thus throwing the country into a tailspin . And all throughout we're put through the prism of media , of inquiry , of a search for the facts in the midst of two systems shown in the film : American journalism ( we see American military interviewed ) and Arab journalism , and each side in dialog and argument , with location footage interspersed . In a way it's a dense film in just its 84 minutes . This might be Noujaim's main strength is the accumulation of points of view , of perspectives . It's not just pat a statement to make that Control Room takes the side of the Iraqi's and that's it . There's also accountability taken in . There's an fascinating cross-section that reveals some of Bush's hypocrisy ( not hard to do , and there's such an abundance , but just one instance for example ) , where Bush says that "" the people of Iraq will control their own destiny . . . they will not just say they were following orders . "" Cut to some footage of Americans , in possible dire straits , being asked by Iraqi's why they're in Iraq . "" I'm just following orders , "" they all say . Is it America , or just Bush ? Is it just Sadaam , or a whole mix of Iraqi's that have to be seen through the prism of the media coverage ? What is really propaganda ? Control Room , ultimately , isn't the greatest of documentaries , mostly in a form that bounces around with the only structure with Bush at the start with his message of "" watch out , Iraq , we're attacking now ! "" to the disgusting message on the Aircraft carrier at the end . But it is an important one , almost like an early , crucial appendage to the more recent No End in Sight . If only for a moment can we have a view into the first huge cluster-f of the century , Control Room has a purpose .


Text2: We are talking about things beyond science , about the imaginings of men's minds , about good and evil . While we anxiously await Lesbian Vampire Killers , we can visit a Hammer classic that has loads of naturally endowed women in a finishing school . While the lesbianism that is inferred is probably just normal boarding school hi-jinks , we are able to enjoy the peaks of pleasure exposed to our view . The vampire Mircalla ( Yutte Stensgaard ) has plenty of girls to go skinny dipping with . The teacher Richard ( Michael Johnson ) is quite taken with the beauty that he fellow teacher ( Ralph Bates ) believes to be the reincarnation of a Countess that died 120 years previous . Another teacher ( Suzanna Leigh ) almost buys it after she continues to stick her nose into the problems of dying and missing . As expected , the villagers finally take matters into their own hands to rid themselves of the problem .

238,"Text1: Quite good , if very 80's From the moment I heard of this film , I knew I had to watch it . . . a buddy comedy pairing up Charles Grodin and Robert De Niro , that's simply too good , to golden an idea to miss . As expected , Grodin's deadpan and matter-of-fact humor compliments De Niro's hot-headed , sarcastic witty humor perfectly . The plot is interesting , though the pace seemed odd to me . It gets going faster than you'd expect it to , and then proceeds to take it's good time getting to where it's going . Maybe it's just too long since I've seen a movie of this period . There's no doubt about it ; the film is very 80's . Around half-way through the film , I thought to myself : "" There is no doubt as to the fact that this movie was made in the same decade as The Blues Brothers . "" It starts out 80's , continues 80's and ends 80's . The music , the tone , the dialog . . . everything . Any fan of the movies and culture of those years should love it . Heck , I'm not . . . and I thought it was pretty darn great . The score consists heavily of jazz and blues , which both fits and just sounds , well , damn good . The action is somewhat . . . well , close to non-existent , but that's not what this film is about . It's about the characters - the people we follow . True , only the two main characters are well-developed . . . but they all seemed credible , and what back-story was provided was excellent . The acting is all good . The humor mostly works . . . though there were two characters who seemed to only be there to provide comic relief , and of the worst kind . They were inexplicably daft , and this was just hit on every single time we see them . . . no depth whatsoever to them . Some of the jokes and gags try too hard to be funny , and a few are added in at points in the movie that are too busy , too much going on for us to find them funny . To the director and the writer , I say this : Remember , less is more . You can't cram in jokes wherever . Like action , humor needs pacing and timing to work . Finally , De Niro fools the same character not once , not twice , but three times with the exact same trick . It turns out to be a setup , but still . Still , this is one of the best films of its kind , and it's a lot better than many , if not necessarily all ( The Blues Brothers and Trading Places definitely top it ) 80's comedies . I recommend this film to most people who can enjoy a film that is a little older than brand new . . . it has , most definitely , aged quite well . Watch it for De Niro , watch it for Grodin , watch it for some good laughs and a good film experience ( thought it would be a lie to say that it's exceptionally well-made , from a purely technical standpoint ) .


Text2: Funny Anytime Of The Year Edmund Blackadder is one of the greatest characters British television has ever produced . He's cruel , selfish and oh so cunning and it's a bit of a shock to see him undergo a character change and be the kindest man in all of England . But don't worry , in this reworking of Dickens A CHRISTMAS CAROL Blackadder soon turns into the anti hero we all know and hateThis is a side splitting Christmas feast for fans of the BLACKADDER series and we get flashbacks to series two and three of the historical sit-com and a glimpse of how the show might have looked if it continued into the space age .

Text2: Odds and ends Some classic films ought to be left alone , as is the case of "" Out of the Past "" , the Jacques Tourneur's 1947 movie , that can stand on its own . The idea that anyone can remake something that was well done before , or give it with a new treatment , usually ends up badly because we would be comparing the old picture with what someone has done with it now . Whatever possessed Taylor Hackford , an otherwise good director , to try his hand at changing the original , is beyond comprehension since it doesn't improve it , or change it , in a positive way . The film is loosely adapted from Daniel Mainwaring's screenplay . At times , watching this movie , we thought we were watching an adaptation of "" Chinatown "" , a movie it parallels because of the subject matter and the setting , without the originality . The plot makes no sense , which is probably what makes the new version so wrong . Jeff Bridges , an excellent actor seems to be out of place in the movie . Also , Rachel Ward , doesn't add anything to her portrayal of Jessie . Jane Greer , who appeared in the original film , returns as the ruthless real estate developer . Richard Widmark has nothing to do . James Woods character is also a puzzle . Perhaps the key to this movie is to watch it for the glorious Mexican locales of Cozumel , Chichen Itza and Tulum and listen to Phil Collins title song .

This movie is a remake of a Japanese movie called "" Kairo "" , and I found this movie to be better than that one . It had better images and scary stuff .

Text2: Informative and fun documentary . ' It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World ' is one of my all-time favourite comedies , one of the very few movies I've watched repeatedly . ( One reason I've managed to see so many movies is because I very seldom allocate the time to watch any movie I've already seen . "" Mad World ' is one of the few exceptions that I'll watch over and over . ) Roundabout the sixth or seventh time I watched ' Mad World ' , I twigged that there isn't a single punchline in this very funny comedy : all of the humour comes from physical action and the characters ' reactions . The most hilarious scene is the one in which Jonathan Winters wrecks Arnold Stang's and Marvin Kaplan's service garage . As brilliant as ' Mad World ' is , it's a very unwieldy film . It would have worked better with fewer comedians making cameo appearances , since many of the ones who get a look-in are given nothing to do . The idea of casting the Three Stooges as firemen is downright hilarious , but in the film they merely make a brief appearance in firemen's gear : they never get to wreak any havoc . Many other comedians in this film are likewise wasted . If ' Mad World ' were remade today , the story would never work : most of the characters would have cell phones , and they would behave differently . I've read the script of ' It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World ' : it contains many scenes that were never shot at all . Spencer Tracy absolutely refused to work after five p . m . ( the time of day when he started drinking ) , and thus many of his scenes were never filmed . Among the unfilmed is a brief dialogue scene between Tracy and Sid Caesar . More interesting ( but also unfilmed ) is a touching dialogue sequence between Caesar and Edie Adams aboard Ben Blue's aeroplane , when they think they're going to win the race and get all the money . Adams reminisces about her early days in a demeaning hotel job in Saint Joseph , Missouri , when her co-workers humiliated her : now she plans to return to that hotel as a wealthy guest , and humiliate her former co-workers . ( Screenwriter William Rose was from St Joseph , Missouri : I wonder if this scene was autobiographical . ) Maddeningly , many sequences that were shot for ' Mad World ' were deleted . I especially regret the loss of a poignant telephone scene between Tracy and Buster Keaton as a reformed crook who owns a motorboat that can take Tracy to Mexico . When Tracy goes to the drugstore to eat an ice cream sundae , it's actually a pretext for him to use a coin phone to ring up Keaton . This is the scene that would have informed audiences of Tracy's plan to steal the money . As the movie now stands , Keaton's relationship to Tracy remains unclear , and it's also unclear precisely when Tracy's character turns crooked . For years , I'd hoped to rediscover the excised Buster Keaton footage : I now sadly believe that it no longer exists . When ' Mad World ' was re-released on video in 1991 , there was some publicity about ' restored footage ' . The only restored footage is during the service garage sequence - - we see highway patrolmen cowering behind their cars while Winters wrecks the garage - - and this added footage makes the movie less funny , not more so . ' Something a Little Less Serious ' is an informal documentary that was added to the ' 91 video . Director Stanley Kramer and some of the participants in ' Mad World ' have reunited for an informal lunch , in which they share some memories of the movie . Kramer had a reputation for earnest movies about racism and Nazi war crimes , so ' It's a Mad World ' was his attempt to create something a little less serious . I learnt a few interesting facts here . Arnold Stang broke his left wrist shortly before production began - - Stang is left-handed - - but he chose to conceal the injury so that he wouldn't be replaced . In the shot when Stang and Kaplan pick up a truck axle and use it as a battering ram , Stang is holding the axle with only his right hand .

Text2: An Unmarried Woman - Needs Some Kind of Bliss Jill Clayburgh gives an off-the-wall performance in this 1978 film dealing with a woman who must confront the fact that her husband has walked out on her . After seemingly having the perfectly married life with a precocious daughter , Clayburgh is forced to re-enter life in a time of sexual revolution in America . Michael Murphy is superb as her husband who walks out on her , and there is fine support from Cliff Gorman , the guy who knows the score and Alan Bates , who steals the film as Saul Kaplan , the rebel artist who got his inspiration for expressionism when his mother threw a pickled herring at his father ! The film , before the entrance of Bates , depicts men as overly obsessive sex fiends who will go to any length to make a conquest . While the Kaplan figure goes from that description , Clayburgh suddenly becomes an independent woman . Penelope Russianoff , who had a Ph . D in psychology in real life , portrays the therapist that Clayburgh goes to when Murphy walks out . For a non-actress , she is perfect for the part since she is in every sense of meaning , a true therapist . Finding fault with a basically good film that should have been better may be shown by the inconsistencird of the Clayburgh performance . Her Jewish-American attributes at the beginning get a rude awakening when Murphy walks out . Yet , she goes through a period of shock and desire to cling to something only to boldly claim her independence as a woman . The ending of the film is a definite disappointment . Erica ( Clayburgh ) again proves that as a scorned woman , she hesitates to re-enter life and will , if anything , be subordinate to it .

( There are Spoilers ) Getting the terrible news that his best friend and army buddy Joey De Fellita was killed in a car smash-up private eye Mike Hammer who's on the scene of Joey's accident won't buy the story that Joey's death was at all accidental . In Hammers mind Joey was murdered and murdered for something that he wasn't supposed to know or do . Going against the advice of his friend in the police department Capt . Pat Chambers Hammer checks out what was the cause of Joey's death and finds out from his friend Ivan Saric a police pathologist that Joey was in fact brutally beaten to death and his death made to look like it was a car accident . That confirms Hammers darkest fears of what really happened to his friend Joey De Fellita . It's now a personal matter with Mike Hammer going all out in finding Joey's killer , or killers , and not caring who's toes he steps on . Hammer turns the entire city upside down and inside out to eventually catch , and personally punish , those who did Joey in . In the process Hammer uncovers a horror so terrifying that even he at first doesn't believe it . Joey was somehow involved with the mob in being a runner for this Mafioso bigwig named Machetti who through payoffs from corrupt Congressman John O'Hair is expected by hook and by crook to get him elected governor . O'Hair using uncut diamonds as payoff money , being that their untraceable , will have Machetti's political machine hand him over the votes that he needs to get into the state house . In return O'Hair will turn over large sections of the city of New York to Macheitt's money-making and money-laundering legit front , The Macheitti Construction Company . This would give Macheitti & Co . the opportunity to ransack the city in getting no-bid and useless , but very profitable , state contracts from future Governor O'Hair . Which besides putting tens of millions of dollars in Macheitti's pockets will drive tens of thousands of city residents , that includes Joey's mom Mama De Fellita , into the streets without a place to live . With the exception of Ralph Meeker , who played Mike Hammer in "" Kiss me Deadly "" , Kevin Dobson is about as close as being Mike Hammer as anyone who ever played the rough and tumble private eye . Sure of himself and not at all afraid of who he deals with and how much pull or muscle and firepower that they have . Dobson comes across as an almost suicidal type of guy who would rather get himself killed before making any deal with those that he's battling with no matter how good the deal is . The fact that the Machetti mob , through it's mobbed up lawyer Lou Krone , handed over the person , dead on arrival , who supposedly murdered Joey De Fellita on a platter , or hook , to him doesn't at all stop Hammer from going after Macheitti & Co . Whom he feels deep inside his gut were the real murderers of his friend Joey De Fellita . Hammer's private secretary Velda played by a perky Cindy Pickett is also an added plus in the film . With her not being the helpless and damsel in distress girl that were used to seeing in most Mike Hammer movies or TV shows . Pickett is more then able to take care of herself with out her hard knocking boss ' , Mike Hammer , help . It's sad that Dobson didn't get the chance to play in more Mike Hammer films in that he would have improved the character he played in "" Margin for Murder "" that he so skillfully and brutally depicted in that film ; Mike Hammer .


Text2: fantastic for laughs - for all the unintentional ( ? ) reasons - though lacks things like texture and quality . . . . . . which is fine . Doogal probably wouldn't of caught my attention in the slightest - and I barely took a glance to it when it was first released ( or escaped ) into theaters last year . But then when I saw Jon Stewart's credits on this site , his name popped up for this movie . I clicked it and was momentarily horrified : Jimmy Fallon , Ian McKellan , Judi Dench , William H . Macy ? One of these does not belong ! So after some head-scratching I watched it more as a goof than anything with friends . Boy , oh boy , you don't quite know what you got till it's gone , so the song goes . Doogal is an American re-dubbing of a movie that was in English ( and , apparently , featured Bill Nighy in the now Jimmy Fallon role , which is completely inexplicable and even offensive to Nighy fans ) , and not even a GOOD re-dubbing : the dialog most of the time doesn't match up at all , and one character , a moose ( voiced by Kevin Smith - as a favor to the Weinsteins to be sure ) , barely opens his mouth . It's got a good guy and bad guy that are springs ( with Stewart playing one of them , in maybe the most ironically cool part of the miasma ) , tired and old-hat pop-culture references left out from the 90s and elsewhere , which come at every turn possible , and has animation that might look decent if this were a ) on the Nick Jr channel , or b ) a video-game created for kids who are playing their very first video game . As entertainment , however , it is meant to be a goofy journey to get three diamonds to free a bunch of kids frozen in a carousel while Zeebad ( Stewart ) plots to get the diamonds to freeze the sun ( albeit no one seems to notice that Zebadee , McKellan's spring , lacks to know-how to use his mustache - yes , his mustache - to thaw out the youngsters ) . It's such a poorly run ship you wonder if people really lost their jobs over it ( or if the Weinsteins got stoned out of their gourde with the re-writers after green-lighting the re-dubbing ) , and , ugh , I haven't even gotten yet to mention the sexual tension between a caterpillar and a cow ! So , in a way , the movie is actually really funny and spectacularly campy in the way that one might see in an old AIP release from the 60s or 70s . Only difference is , this is supposed to be a legitimate CGI movie for kids ! This being said , actors like Macy and Stewarts ( maybe not Goldberg , who knows ) took on the project knowing what they're getting into . Needless to say , if any good could've come from it , the spring has been mentioned often in splendid self-deprecating ( and self disbelieving ) manner by Stewart on the Daily Show .

Text2: Fun , If Missing the Mel Brooks Touch I thought the stage musical adapted from Mel Brooks ' classic 1968 film was terrific and if anything even more outrageous than the movie . So it's strange that this movie based on the musical should feel so tame by comparison . It doesn't have that bawdy , let's offend everyone sense of fun that Brooks projects usually have , and it all feels a little lacklustre . Still , if you like the stage version , you'll probably have fun with this movie , as it's a virtual recreation , and the music sounds great . What I appreciate most about this movie is its willingness to be an old-fashioned movie musical . Unlike "" Chicago , "" which felt the need to justify all of its musical numbers as fantasy sequences taking place in the mind of a principal character , "" The Producers "" has people just breaking spontaneously into song , no apologies . If you're going to watch it , you have to accept that people are going to sing and dance and get on with it . And since most of the people in the film performed in the original Broadway cast , the songs are sung and danced well . Will Ferrell is new to the material , but he equips himself nicely as neo-Nazi Franz Liebkind and brings a lot of energy to his scenes . I would love to report that Uma Thurman stops the show as Ulla , the Swedish bombshell , but she doesn't . Uma , God love her , doesn't have the chops or the dancing skills to put over Ulla's big number , though the film makers do use her height to humorous advantage . I love the original film , but I don't worship it like some others , so I'm not as averse to playing with the material , and I didn't feel the need to compare Nathan Lane's and Matthew Broderick's performances to those of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder . They don't really reinterpret the material as much as recreate it , but that's o . k . We're not talking about doing a Eugene O'Neill revival here , and Brooks's material has only so much depth to mine . This movie is a fun way to pass a couple of hours .

247,"Text1: This horror omnibus ain't up to much Stephen King's films don't often translate to the silver screen well , and pretty much everything that Romero has touched outside of his famous ' Dead ' trilogy and the brilliant cult gem ; Martin hasn't been up to much - and Creepshow does nothing to change either of these facts . Creepshow is another horror omnibus stemming from the eighties , only this time we are given five tales of terror in a distinctly comic book style . The comic book style tries to capture the ' magic ' of horror comics that were popular in America in the 1950's ; but for me , all the style does is give the film a kiddie sort of a feel . The stories aren't very good either , with all five lacking in imagination , logic , coherency , adequate events to fill the running time or a combination of two or more of these elements . Previous and later films have proved that the omnibus horror style can lead to some good horror . Classics such as Black Sabbath , Dead of Night and many of the films that Amicus made in the seventies show this best - but the eighties provided some good ones ; and this isn't one of them . The first tale gives you a good impression of what sort of film you're in for . This distinctly under-imaginative segment features a lame story and some even worse ' special ' effects , both of which recur throughout the flick . Story number two could have been good , but it's the effects again and this time the acting that lets it down . We get treated to a tale that is very much in a comic book style - but it's never interesting enough to be good . Leslie Nielson lights up the film for the third story . It's odd to see him in a ' serious ' role , but once you've gotten over that - even this segment isn't much above the average . The fourth segment seems to be the centrepiece , with a massively overlong running time and a story that can't fill it . It's a shame , because finding a monster in a crate is about as camp as it gets . . . but Creepshow manages to make even that boring . As bad as tale four is , at least it's not as dull and pointless as the climatic story . It's obvious that the film was trying to be a little bit clever by sneaking in a psychological tale at the end - but this is neither the time or the place , and the overlong run time throughout Creepshow will have numbed you too much to really appreciate this story by the time it appears . On the whole - a shame , but this isn't very good at all .


Text2: Doesn't even come close to doing James Herbert's book justice . Some of the best films of all time have been literary adaptations ; but this adaptation of James Herbert's novel , ' Haunted ' , isn't one of them . James Herbert is one of my favourite writers , and although ( and I'm sure my fellow Herbert fans will agree with me ) Haunted isn't the man's best work - it surely deserves much better handling than this . This adaptation isn't even faithful to the original novel ! The characters have the same names , and most plot points are intact - but a lot of things , including important elements such as the persona of the lead character , and the ending have been changed entirely - meaning this isn't really an adaptation of Herbert's novel , it's merely a film that uses the same character names as the book , and a similar setting . The plot follows cynical parapsychologist David Ash when he is asked to investigate at a spooky old mansion . The inhabitants include the ( probably ) insane Nanny Tess , and the three siblings ; Simon , Robert and Christina . It isn't long before David realises that there's something strange about this family . . . Something I really can't understand about this film is simply WHY they deviated from the book ? There's nothing in the book that isn't film-able , and although most of what has been changed isn't all that important , many things ; such as the fact that in the book , the old house doesn't have a phone , meaning David had to walk to the local phone box just increases the isolation and makes the whole piece more frightening . The way that the ending has been changed is truly unforgivable , as the climax to the novel is the thing that really makes the story what it is . Up until the climax , Haunted is pretty much just another ghost story ( albeit a good one ) ; but the ending is where Herbert gets to show his imagination - yet this film has gone and changed it , leaving the ending as little more than another climax to another ghost film . There isn't big black dog in this film either ! The cast , however , is fairly decent ; with Aidan Quinn not convincing me much at first , but he gets better as it progresses . Kate Beckinsale stands out the most , as the beautiful Christina Mariell . Overall , all that's happened here is that director Lewis Gilbert has changed a good horror novel into a very superfluous movie . My advice is simple - read the book , forget the movie .

248,"Text1: Dangerous Duo A Dutch mystery writer tries to strip away THE MASK OF DIMITRIOS Makropoulos to discover the truth about his wicked life . From Warner Bros . and director Jean Negulesco comes this well-produced version of Eric Ambler's novel A Coffin For Dimitrios . Thickly plotted and jammed with intriguing characters , the film will amply reward the attentive viewer . Moving quickly across Europe ( Istanbul , Athens , Sofia , Geneva , Belgrade & Paris ) the plot never lags as it adds details to the plots & crimes of Dimitrios . The final culmination of his nefarious career is most justified and quite satisfying . Diminutive Peter Lorre ( undeserving of the pitiful 4th place billing he receives ) brings his unique talents to the role of the Dutch author . Feisty and tenacious , he lets nothing get in his way as he ferrets out the details for which he's searching . Massive Sydney Greenstreet portrays the mysterious stout gentleman who arranges an alliance with Lorre to seek information about the violently deceased Dimitrios . Looking somewhat like a malevolently cheerful Buddha , Greenstreet literally dominates most of his scenes with his enormous talent , his great bulk and expressive eyes put to most effective dramatic use . Teamed with Lorre , the pair make a compelling duo - - like a sinister Laurel & Hardy - - and are most entertaining to watch . They would appear in nine films together ; this was one of their best . The movie's only real drawback is the complete absence of Greenstreet & Lorre during the lengthy flashback sequences . But this is but a minor quibble as the rest of the cast comport themselves quite well . As the despicable Dimitrios , Zachary Scott manages to divest himself of any hint of the heroic , while retaining a certain dash and smarmy charm about his persona . Faye Emerson , the picture's leading lady , has actually a rather limited role , but she makes good use of her screen time as a Sofia nightclub owner with a sad story to tell Lorre . The large supporting cast features a considerable number of European character actors . Especially noteworthy are Kurt Katch as a Turkish police detective ; Eduardo Ciannelli as a helpful Bulgarian reporter ; Victor Francen as a cat-loving spy master living in Switzerland ; and Steven Geray as a most unfortunate Yugoslavian governmental clerk . Chatty Florence Bates livens up her one short scene as an American society hostess living in Istanbul . Set in 1938 , the film was produced during World War Two . It is a fine example of how movie magic and back lot technology could transport an audience to a temporarily inaccessible geographic location .


Text2: Od , but interesting , sing-along short from Fleischer This is an odd little entry from Fleischer in their Screen Song sing-along series . About half animation , half sing-along and a little hard to describe . Because I want to discuss some details , this is a spoiler warning : There really isn't all that much to this one . It starts out with mice taking buckets of water and splashing them on an elephant bathing behind a screen and just kind of goes on from there . Either mice are scrubbing other animals or the animals are washing themselves . There are two bits which I particularly like-one where a mouse is bathing cats using a tub and washboard , like a laundrywoman and a bit where a mouse , trying to get a sleeping dog to continue cranking a water-pump , pulls a pair of dice from his pocket and they morph into a bone ( a slang expression for dice is "" bones "" ) . After the cleaning finishes , a rather odd rabbit assembles the animals into an orchestra and then very exaggeratedly tells the audience that they will be playing the title tune and encourages the audience to sing along by following the "" bouncing ball "" . There follows the standard lyric display , though the last part features the rabbit in place of the ball and the words change as he steps on them . The animation is nice , though the song is rather melancholy and the singing is uninspired . Worth tracking down .

249,"Text1: Smart Cop Gone Berserk Laird Cregar's performances in motion pictures were small in number ( a bit over twenty films ) , but large in ability to hold audience attention and in sheer artistry . Whether Jack The Ripper , George Bone , Clive Oxford , Willard Gates , Sir Henry Morgan , or whoever , Cregar dominates his films , and usually each performance is unique in itself . He is usually considered a movie villain . It's true that violence plays a heavy part in his films , but his "" Lodger "" is driven mad by sorrow at the loss of his talented brother due to a prostitute ; his Gates is in over his head , due to the demands of his evil boss ( Tully Marshall ) and the target of his actions ( a deadly Alan Ladd ) ; his Bone is suffering from a mental disease , but trying to compose the concerto that will give him immortality . In short , most of his villains have something in their background that makes them pitiful if frightening . Occasionally he plays a run-of-the-mill lowlife . In BLOOD AND SAND , his bullfighting critic "" Curo "" ( which means a Bull's rectum ) is a self-important parasite on bullfighters like J . Carroll Naish and Tyrone Power , whom he builds up , lives off of , and then throws aside when they no longer make large salaries . But in his catalog of roles , possibly his most frightening one is his New York City master police inspector Ed Cornell . Not in fancy clothes or make-up , Cornell is mostly fierce attention and an ever-parked fedora hat on his head . He is the perfect realization of ability , brains , and retribution . For Ed Cornell misuses his badge to destroy promoter Frankie Christopher ( Victor Mature ) . In playing the ultimately dangerous cop , Cregar actually played the scariest villain in his career ( even more frightening in his way than "" the Lodger "" or Bone ) . Vicki Lynn ( Carole Landis ) was a promising model whose career was being pushed by Christopher . Mature plays Christopher realistically - a friendly but pushy type who is a wire puller through his contacts , like actor Robin Ray ( Alan Mowbray ) and Larry Evans ( Allyn Joslyn ) . Christopher hoped to get Lynn into acting and a fancier career . But she is found murdered . Circumstances are not settled in any direction , but when Cornell enters the case , and starts examining Christopher , he starts making veiled insinuations about the latter's actions and motives and activities on the night of the murder - insinuations that suggest a remarkably subtle detective intelligence - but also an inexplicable hostility . It soon becomes evident that Cornell is not simply trying to solve a murder . He is trying to definitely prove Christopher is guilty - or is he trying to frame Christopher ? Ed Cornell is Cregar's model ( unwittingly and unintentionally ) for Orson Welles ' later Hank Quinlan . Both men are incredibly adept at their work , but both become incredibly corrupt at it . Quinlan's corruption carries on too long and too far . Cornell's , as we learn , is concentrated on this case - but it goes far enough to establish his own evil as memorable . Being Cregar he varies his menace towards Mature with some lighter moments . Please note the intellectual story about the rare butterflies that he mentions when talking to his superior about laying a trap . He does show a human side eventually as well . But it is the evil that he does that dominates in this film , making it one of the first great film noir of the 1940s .


Text2: Has some potential . . . but little more If you like surrealistic films , like Cocteau's or Salvador Dali's , THE HEARTS OF AGE may appeal to you . It certainly throws symbols around , but it is the work of two teenagers at a prep school , not of a major French 20th Century poet and film maker and a major Spanish artist . When the latter two put in symbols , and repeated them , there was a rhythm and sense in their use - especially as their films were meant to shock or to attack the Church . Here two preppies , William Vance and George O . Welles , are trying to make a surreal movie . It has some nice touches . A hand reaches out of the crypt of a cemetery ( or seemingly so ) to grab a stone marker cross . But it's "" dollar book "" symbolism . In high school I was involved in making a film , and it involved a rare tablet that unlocked hideous power secrets . I suggested , in a scene supposedly shot at a religious altar , that the tablet be placed in a skeletal hand . Disembodied or fossilized hands scare people , and are useful in keeping an audience's attention . That was why I suggested it . From my above reduction of one of the two creators of this film , calling Orson Welles by his first name , I am sort of hinting at the problem at watching THE HEARTS OF AGE . If it's creators were a pair of non-entities we would not care to even consider the film . But it was co-directed by Welles , some three years before "" THE CRADLE WILL ROCK "" , some four years before "" THE WAR OF THE WORLD "" broadcast , and some seven years before CITIZEN KANE . Welles ' creative ascendancy was about to blossom , so we look at this early stunt as full of suggestions of greatness . That's stretching it . It shows potential . Mr . Vance , Virginia Nicholson , and Paul Edgarton do as well with their acting parts as the normal teenagers who are in a school production . It's when Welles shows up that we see more spice in the acting . This is not based on a blind Wellesian hero worship . He shows a subtlety in his playing the part of the mysterious male figure that is lacking in the other three performances . Ms Nicholson seems bad tempered and suspicious at times ( mostly at Mr . Welles ) but she fails to gain our interest or sympathy . Mr . Edgarton as a doomed bell ringer / slave ( he's in black face ) gets some sympathy as he is forced to constantly labor , and eventually he dies by hanging . But the lack of any rational or symbolic reason for this kills the effect of his demise ! Welles obviously was given the best part because he can act . He first appears as a jaunty figure , in top hat and tales . His thin body ( he could not have played this part forty years later ) seems to be springing down various ladders and walks as in a dance . With his pale , bald features he may represent death dancing ( and later playing the piano ) . But is he ? Or is he simply an old man , who is happy to survive his wife ( Ms Nicholson ? ) and buries her quickly when he finds her corpse ? When Pauline Kael did her hatchet job on Welles ' contribution to CITIZEN KANE , she pointed out that his make-up in THE HEARTS OF AGE mirrored the elderly Kane . There is a resemblance , but then keep in mind that in both films we are seeing the frame of Welles ' face covered by a bald wig . So there would be a resemblance anyway . Moreover , Kael was so determined to rob Welles ' Kane performance of any originality that she also found he looked like Peter Lorre as Dr . Gogol in MAD LOVE , a 1935 thriller where Lorre is an insane surgeon terrorizing a crippled pianist ( Colin Clive ) . When Welles was asked about this , he said he never even heard of Lorre's movie before . He probably hadn't . My guess is that any resemblance between Welles ' performance in THE HEARTS OF AGE and CITIZEN KANE are solely due to both characters he played having to age or be old . Certainly when he played the old Charles Foster Kane , he moved slowly","{""output"": ""YES""}"

251,"Text1: "" And I've caught something really wild this time , haven't I ? "" For any sense of appreciation for this movie , I think you first have to get past the absurdity of the basic plot . You figure that Mark Rutland became president of his family's business because he had a fair amount of business acumen and a semblance of common sense . Once he realizes that Mary Taylor has robbed his safe and has a history of aliases in other cities doing the same , how is it he keeps the romance going ? Especially when Marnie makes every effort to dissuade him at every turn . They say love is blind and marriage is an eye opener , but it seems to me that Rutland had his eyes sewn shut . With that off my chest , director Hitchcock does a decent enough job of maintaining intrigue and suspense in the story ; the aforementioned safe robbery scene with the cleaning lady was particularly noteworthy . Yet at the same time , I have to wonder why Hitch resorted to such almost comical techniques as used in the riding sequence of the fox hunt scene and the rapid zoom in and out of the money in the safe . The latter reminded me of some of those 1940's Warner Brothers cartoons that employ a similar device . It had the feel of a fledgling director who might still be searching for his own vision in making a picture instead of someone with a whole pile of them under his belt already . I have to tell you though , the scene that made me wince was Marnie's horse taking that fall over the jump . You know what the biggest surprise for me was ? Finding out that actress Louise Latham played the parts of both the elder Mrs . Edgar and the young mother of Marnie in the scene with the sailor . The makeup job was so good for both characterizations that it even fooled Hitchcock's assistant director on the set , who asked who the actress was to show up for the flash back filming . Coming off of Hitchcock's suspense thriller "" The Birds "" , I thought Tippi Hedren did more than a competent job as the conflicted title character , bringing a range of emotion to a role that could have wound up a caricature if not done as well . Opposite Sean Connery , Hedren wondered how she could pull it off . Credit director Hitchcock with a firm but insightful bit of advice - "" It's called acting "" .


Text2: "" Be careful , I'll get you yet . "" The lodger's first appearance , dressed like the description of a murderer named ' The Avenger ' with a wrap across his face , makes it a bit too obvious that Jonathan Drew might be the killer . That's what hooks the viewer into wondering who the Avenger might actually be , and with only a handful of credited characters , the only other reasonable suspect would be police detective Joe . Alfred Hitchcock masterfully directs his first British thriller with hallmarks of the style that in later years would make his name a household word . The steep stairways of the boarding house , a recurring black cat and Hitchcock's own understated presence were all to be repeated in later films , not to mention central characters in a tense game of identity crisis . What makes the lodger character ( Ivor Novello ) particularly creepy is his unusual behavior in turning women's pictures away from view and the borderline malevolent interest he takes in young Daisy Bunting , a fair haired girl who has all the prerequisites for the Avenger's next victim . There are a couple of anomalies that bear mentioning . I found it more than a bit unusual that the lodger's murder map would have been drawn in exactly the same way as the one the police have , a set of smaller triangles within a larger one to mark locations of the stranglings . Speaking of triangles , perhaps it was unintentional , but the one between Drew , Daisy and Joe presents a lot of unresolved tension as events unfold . The other scenario I had some problem with involves the mob chase after the lodger and Daisy leave the pub - just where did ALL those people come from ? Presumably it was late evening with most people staying safe at home , but it looked like a hundred plus people were after the innocent victim . At times excessively grainy and marked with imperfections , I was fortunate to have this rare movie turn up on a Hitchcock DVD compilation of nine British films on three discs put out by St . Clair Vision . These early Hitchcock efforts have been easy to find for a long time now except for "" The Lodger "" , and "" Blackmail "" which is also part of the set . Even if you're not a Hitchcock fan per se , it's a great set to get into to see the early development of the suspense genre , with an opportunity to see how the director progressed over the course of his early career .

252,"Text1: One of the best comedies ever , and the best "" SNL "" I can think of . . . There's something funny about the actual Blues Brothers , Jake and Elwood . You don't even have to hear them say anything particularly funny to laugh at the sheer sight of the wacky duo lined up against one another , wearing the infamous clothing and sunglasses . And since their appearance on "" Saturday Night Live , "" and then later in their milestone feature film , they have infiltrated society . "" The Blues Brothers "" ( 1980 ) is , and will remain as far as I see it , the funniest "" SNL "" skit adaptation to ever hit the big screen . The problem with adapting characters from 5-minute skits on "" Saturday Night Live "" is the fact that they are just that - - 5-minute skits - - and are not substantial enough to merit any type of further focus . Backdrops are not needed - - all we need are quirky characters with distinguishing traits or gestures that will make us laugh . "" The Ladies Man , "" "" The Coneheads , "" "" A Night At the Roxbury , "" and "" Superstar "" are all examples of material stretched too far - - basically just skits multiplied by their original running length some 15 or so times . In fact , there are really only two or three feature length movies with "" SNL "" characters that are any good . I love "" Saturday Night Live , "" but even I have to admit that some things are not meant to be turned into a movie . I'd rather see a compilation of the character's best moments on the show hit the big screen as opposed to a weak plot-driven film about them doing many unfunny things a quarter as funny as anything on the television program . "" The Blues Brothers "" has a great plot ( considering it's an "" SNL "" film ) and a great pair of characters . Jake Blues ( John Belushi ) has just been released from prison , greeted by his taller ( and more slender ) brother Elwood ( Dan Aykroyd ) .

How will they do this ? Reunite their old band , of course ! But it won't be easy , because in the process they get entangled in the affairs of a Neo-Nazi and a heavily armed woman ( cameo by Carrie Fisher ) . They also get entwined in a bunch of musical sequences with blues legends such as James Brown , Aretha Franklin , and Ray Charles . ( John Candy also stars in this film , and in John Hughes ' masterpiece "" Planes , Trains and Automobiles , "" he did the "" mess around "" to Ray Charles ' song on the radio while driving an awful car . ) It's all in the name of fun , of course . Oh , and in the name of God . Quoting Elwood , "" We're on a mission from God . "" Not exactly a laugh-out-loud line of dialogue , but the more you think about it , the funnier it becomes .

They're like dear old friends and every time I see them on old reruns of the television show I get instant nostalgia . When you become a fan of "" Saturday Night Live , "" you enter a sort of small group of friends you've never even met . You just somehow feel very close to the actors and their friends .

Text2: An entertaining modern-update of a classic fairy tale "" Pretty Woman "" was the film that made Julia Roberts a star and a major player in Hollywood ( for a while she held the record for being the highest-paid actress in Hollywood ) .

He tries to culture her and instill good taste , manners and general class ; meanwhile others raise a suspicious eyebrow when she embarrasses herself in public , clearly not belonging in the upper-class group . The film follows a standard fairy-tale-style formula of an abused girl falling in love and being rescued from her old lifestyle . The movie spins this into a modern update with more relevant themes - mainly prostitution . Ironically this is one of Roberts ' first movies and the only one in which she has ever revealed any nudity . Sometimes actors deliver their finest performances before they develop egos and clauses in their contracts . She dares to go out on a limb here more so than she usually does - and the movie succeeds . The direction is suitable , the soundtrack and stylings of the film are oh-so-eighties . . . overall it's just an entertaining , well-done romantic comedy that doesn't try to be anything it isn't .

253,"Text1: A Nutshell Review : Dead Run ( Shisso ) Essentially the movie tells of the story of the central character , Shuji ( Yuga Tegoshi ) , and his ultimate downfall from grace . However , with the way the narrative is set up , you'll most likely be bewildered as to how the movie is going to develop and which direction it's going to take . It's quite messy with its many ideas thrown in at multiple points , each may or may not providing the resolution you're seeking . In fact , it has so many ideas ( since it's adapted from a novel ) , that it's almost like watching an incident laden life of a young boy growing up into a teenager , examining and observing his interactions with unexpected members of society , ranging from small town gangsters , to big town Yakuzas , from gangster molls to his own female peer in Eri ( Hanae Kan ) , who shares the same passion for running as Shuji does . There are quite a number of characters introduced to facilitate this , and more often than not , you only get to know of their background in a rather slow revelation . The movie takes its time to develop the characters and their backgrounds - so don't be expecting the conventional approach . It's a pity though , that some characters become throwaway ones , even after significant screen time had been dedicated featuring them . Of importance is the character of a priest , Father Yuichi ( Etsushi Toyokawa ) , which had a rather rich background story developed and set up as the "" Boo Radley "" of the movie . Given the screen time devoted , I was rather puzzled when it turned out that he too became a disappearing act in the middle portion , before returning for a bit part in the finale . Like most of the other movies shown during the festival , this one also had a segment of its setting in a classroom , and has its fair share of featuring children in lead roles , albeit up to the one-third mark where the more adult actors took over . And lead actor Yuga Tegoshi did an excellent job in his Shuji - a confused boy , utterly moulded by the environment around him , his loneliness stemmed from a disappearing family , and his quest to seek companionship bringing him to Osaka and Tokyo . What finally redeemed the movie was its last third , where it got its act back together , and realized its direction towards its final push to end the movie . It's a full circle tale after all , with a message never to judge a book by its cover , or to judge a character based on hearsay . And what finally hit you , assisting you in sitting through the convoluted storyline , is the excellent piano musical score done by SENS . p . s . at one point in time the projection seemed to have tilted downwards , cutting off the bottom half where the subtitles are . Thankfully there was just one ( inconsequential ) line of dialogue uttered , and was fixed before anything major happened in the story . p . p . s . I thought at one point it had a scene somewhat similar to Sepet , with the handphone bit !

Curse of the Puppet Master is set in a small American town where the ever so slightly dim Robert ' Tank ' Winsley ( Josh Green ) works as a lowly gas station attendant for $30 a week , that is until curio collector & owner of a museum of oddities Dr . Magrew ( George Peck ) & his lovely young daughter Jane ( Emily Harrison ) stop for gas . Magrew notices that Robert is an extremely skilled carver with an exceptional imagination & offers him $35 a week to work for him , with the $5 a week pay rise too much to turn down Robert accepts . Dr . Magrew show's Robert various living puppets made by puppeteer Andre Toulon that he brought in an auction some years previous & ask's Robert to carve the perfect puppet which Magrew hopes to inject with life & recreate Toulon's success . . . Curse of the Puppet Master was the fifth sequel to the rather splendid killer puppet flick Puppetmaster ( 1989 ) & apparently had the working title Puppet Master 6 : The Curse but by this stage it was probably a wise decision to stop numbering them & thus try to fool a few unsuspecting buyers . The first three Puppet Master films were really good & I think they are all great although Puppet Master 4 ( 1993 ) & Puppet Master 5 : The Final Chapter ( 1994 ) were pretty bad apart from some impressive stop-motion animation effects & the nicely atmospheric Bogeda Bay Inn setting which are both absent here from Curse of the Puppet Master as the ambitions of the filmmakers & the budget gets increasingly lower with each new entry into the franchise . Directed by David DeCoteau under the name Victoria Sloan one of his many pseudonym's he had actually directed Puppet Master III : Toulon's Revenge ( 1991 ) but there's no repeat of his earlier magic & Curse of the Puppet Master is pretty dire stuff & even at a paltry 75 odd minutes in length the script feels padded & uneventful . There's no continuity to the earlier films at all , there's no mention of the green life giving serum & Curse of the Puppet Master changes the whole central concept to animating the puppets with a human beings soul which is transferred into the puppet thus giving it life instead of the serum from the previous films . To be honest it's a lame story which is supposed to unfold as some sort of mystery but it's pretty predictable & the single worst aspect of Curse of the Puppet Master is that it relegates the killer puppets to no more than bit parts who do virtually nothing the entire film . There's no explanation of why the puppets obey Magrew or why they suddenly turn on him at the end & like the previous two films they are nowhere evil enough . Another thing is while Magrew makes Robert carve a puppet out of wood the puppet Magrew uses at the end is actually made out of metal is some awful looking tank like creation with a couple laser guns for arms . The ending is awful too & is one of those occasions where the film just literally stops dead & your left thinking ' is that it ? ' or ' what happened ? ' or ' did my DVD player just skip a chapter ? ' . The puppet special effects are the worst of the series so far too , there's a few seconds of stop-motion by the vast majority of the effects work is simple poorly operated rod puppets which look still & have very limited movement . The opening credits have a montage of special effects shots from the previous five films & they beat anything else seen in this . For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II ( 1991 ) . The film is gorier than either parts 4 o5 although two bloody murders don't make this particularly good , there's some slashing & bloody cuts & Tunneller sticks his drill into some guy's groin & his wedding tackle . The whole film & production just looks cheaper than the previous entries , the moody setting & lighting have all but gone & there's a bland visually flat & dull look to it .

The character's are clich√©d , the ghosts are underused & did I mention that it wasn't funny yet ? So here we have a film that tries to be a horror comedy but fails on both counts , High Spirits is not a film I look back on with any fondness . At all . Director Jordan has apparently gone on record as saying that he had no input over the editing process & what was released was substantially different to his original cut , to be honest that sounds like an excuse for making such a bad film as he still directed the scenes which ended up on screen , it was still his script this mess came from & quite frankly how much difference could there have been ? Was there hours of unused footage ? Would any of it been any funnier if there was ? I imagine the studio probably tweaked it a bit but maybe because Jordan's original cut was even worse , I just don't believe this ' it would have been brilliant if the studio had left it alone ' rubbish . , anyway I guess we'll never find out either way . . . I must admit the film looks quite nice with good sets although the special effects vary between impressive & poor . On a side note did anyone else notice the white horse Guttenberg lands in front of when he falls out of the tree hit by lightening ( don't ask ) ? I'm positive you can see the horse's penis dangling between it's legs , not that I specifically look out for these things you understand . . . Technically High Spirits is fine with decent production values . Looking at the cast list it's pretty impressive although no one covers themselves in glory , O'Toole is good but that's it . Gutteneberg tries to act all emotional , oh dear . . . High Spirits is a comedy that simply isn't funny & it's story is a mess that doesn't entertain , I don't know what else to say other than I didn't like it . Could have been better , much better . Watch Ghostbusters ( 1984 ) instead to see how a proper supernatural comedy should be done .

Text2: Can't Hardly Wait To Get Laid . ( spoilers ) American Pie is yet another goofy teenage comedy full of trashy sex jokes and idiot kids trying to get together with beautiful girls , and in the end , it works for everyone except that weird red-headed guy . I'm so sick and tired of movies like this , and if Sean William Scott had not been in this movie , there would not have been a single funny part in it . American Pie is an exploitative film that takes advantage of the vast amounts of immaturity readily found in modern audiences . I'll admit that I laughed at the movie , but it's the kind of laugh that lasts for seconds , and as soon as it's over , it's never funny again . You actually feel cheated because after you watch the movie you can look back and you realize how dumb the jokes really are . Except , of course , for the scene at the very end when Steve Stifler walks into the basement of his house after the party ( ' Mom ? Shibrick ? ! ' ) . THAT will NEVER stop being funny . I don't want to give the impression that I feel that this movie was pounded out in five minutes with no thought and then thrown into production just to make money , because I realize that on some levels , maybe one or two , it is quality comedy . But on all other levels , make no mistake , this is fast-food cinema . It may be fun to watch , but there's no nutritional value .

This role came after her ET fame , remember her as little Gertie . Pity the other stars in that Spielberg film never became the household name that surprisingly that Drew has accomplished . She has got quite a pedigree with the Barrymore legacy . Despite her personal problems , Drew really is a solid actress with a lifetime behind her . Anyway , I never saw this film until Sunday . I remember it being out but I have to say when I was 11 years old , I wanted to be Drew Barrymore ( that was before I knew what happened to her ) . So I guess , I didn't watch it out of envy . I like the casting of Shelley Long who is probably one of the greatest female comediennes of our time who never gets enough work in my opinion to let her talents shine . She can do both drama and comedy equally well . She combines them both in this role as a desperate housewife turned writer . I like the way the film is set up with blame on both father and mother . Sharon Stone debuts in this film too . Ryan O'Neal is worth mentioning because I don't think he was acting in this film . It just hit too close to home . SO you want a good comedy from the eighties , this is pretty good . It's probably a classic compared to contemporary comedy that has become both vulgar and profane .


Text2: Billy Bob can win your heart ! I love Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa and the Bad News Bears remake to 2005 after a 29 years since the original film . The film has changed to modify today's world where computers rule the world which I said at 10 years old to an skeptical neighbor and where even a handicapped wheelchair-bound boy can play baseball . Thornton plays Buttermaker , the major league baseball player who turns coach rather than get a jail sentence . The mother of one his players is played by the divine Marcia Gay Harden . I think the kid from Bad Santa also has a role as does Greg Kinnear who plays a competitive coach . I love watching the kids learn the sport by killing insects since Buttermaker is an exterminator and they sponsored by a strip club . They start getting better in the beginning . They are lovable losers who face ridicule and humiliation every day at school . Suddenly , they get help with a girl pitcher and a guy who's a rebel .

Hell ' ( 1992 ) which at least showed whole programmes rather than piddling clips . Here we've got Z-list celebrities being insufferably pompous about archive telly . One could easily excuse say John Cleese being rude about ' Bottle Boys ' . Coming from Kate Thornton its a bit hard to take . No attempt was made to take into account the context of the era in which the shows were made . I wonder how many of the viewers who chose ' Curry & Chips ' have actually seen it ? It was never repeated or issued on video / D . V . D . so its inclusion was strange . Meera Syal was only eight years old in 1969 but that did not stop her from laying into it . She said that it was basically : ' let's have a laugh at the w-g ' ' . Actually , no it wasn't . It was ' let's have a laugh at the racists ' . The person who found the vandalism of the ' Blue Peter ' garden funny should be ashamed of himself for openly encouraging the sort of attitude that leads to vandalism . I wonder if he would laugh if his own garden were wrecked in similar fashion ? Nevertheless the clips were well chosen for the most part , particularly Annabelle Lwin storming out of an interview with B . A . Robertson and the sheer inanity of ' The Word ' . David Frost's encounter with Jerry Rubin's ' Yippies ' was no worse than you will find on many contemporary talk-shows such as Jeremy Kyle . One hopes that any future shows of this kind will focus on ' reality television ' and the barrel-scraping awfulness they have unfortunately come to symbolise .

Yes , it's the same old beat-em-up stuff you've seen in countless other games but this time around the comic-book edge and blood spatters make it worthwhile .

Text2: Exploitation What an infuriating documentary . Actually , as I write this , it has been almost exactly ten months since Al Qaida flew two passenger jets into the World Trade Center . A shocking event which killed more than two thousand innocent people and forever altered the skyline I admired so much as a kid . I wondered at the time if any entrepreneurs would have the chutzpah to somehow turn this appalling thing into a marketing gimmick and concluded that no one would . But I was wrong . Six months after the fact , ads began cropping up for medals made out of the actual steel frames of the collapsed towers . Little by little , other somber commercials appeared . Some brokerage firm now has TV commercials featuring real-life , actual SURVIVORS of the tragic WORLD TRADE CENTER catasrophe ! The survivors , their pockets stuffed full of cash , face the camera and tell us of their experiences , ending with the conclusion that the best way to fight terrorism is to go right on working and to invest with Salomon Smith Barney or whomever . I'm afraid "" Hotel Terminus "" generates the same feeling , a mixture of anger and disgust . The deportation , imprisonment , and murder of Jews and other minorities is far too horrifying an historical fact to serve as a vehicle for such an on-screen display of self righteousness . Ophuls did a superb job in "" The Sorrow and the Pity , "" mainly by letting the participants and the newsreels speak for themselves about a situation filled with ambiguities . And how eloquent those sources were ! Here , we get way too much of Marcel Ophuls telling us what we're supposed to be thinking and feeling , and about a situation in which good and evil were relatively clear cut . It isn't that his self display fails to be engaging . He's a good performer . Searching for an unwilling interviewee , he wanders through the guy's garden patch , lifting cabbage leaves and asking , "" Are you under here ? "" And he does a splendid reenactment of a telephone call to another prospective interviewee , playing both parts . Those participant who agreed to be interviewed do a pretty good job of hanging themselves , by the way . One of them comes up with something like , "" Oh , yes , Barbie wasn't a bad fellow . He loved his dog . "" ( No kidding . ) It would have been fine if Ophuls had left it at that , although a viewer might understandably wonder how many snippets of conversation had been edited out , and what they consisted of . Weren't there any good guys at all ? Can an entire population be so stupid and unfeeling ? And Ophuls ridicules on camera those witnesses were were unwilling to speak to him about the carryings on that they clearly feel guilty about , or at least ashamed of , because , as they frequently argue , it all happened so long ago . What does Ophuls expect of them ? That they should "" come forward "" like guests on Oprah Winfrey ? If they could ablate their memories as easily as Ophuls can edit his film , they would surely do it . One scene is especially irritating . On camera Ophuls visits a house or hotel that Barbi presumably once lived in . The proprietor emerges and begins to speak to Ophuls . The only language he knows is French . ( Ophuls is equally good in French , German , and English . ) As Ophuls begins to throw him some change-ups , though , the proprietor begins to back off , saying he'd rather not talk anymore . Ophuls then begins shouting accusations at the guy - - in ENGLISH . The guy is backing dumbly away , with occasional protests , while Ophuls screams things like , "" The reason you don't want to talk is that you KNOW he lived in your house , "" and so on . Well - - this isn't an interview . This is Marcel Ophuls playing Yaweh for the rolling cameras , for the English-speaking audience . It will be a sad day for the entrepreneurs when all of the participants and witnesses to these events have grown old and died . There will be no one left alive to humiliate and to blame . We'll need to start all over again , with only the historical record providing us with a guidebook about what not to do next .

260,"Text1: "" Afraid . . . , listen Captain , Clyde Beatty isn't afraid of man , beast nor devil . "" I'm surprised I missed this one as a kid growing up , since anything with wild animals , especially jungle cats I found to be thrilling ; that's why Tarzan has always been a favorite . "" The Lost Jungle "" more than anything appears to be a showcase for the talents of circus animal trainer Clyde Beatty , who portrays himself in the film . Beatty is not particularly impressive in physical stature , which makes it all the more remarkable in the way he handles himself surrounded by all manner of wild beasts both in captivity and in the wild . The search for a legendary island city of Kamor in the South Pacific forms the backdrop for the film's adventure . However it's not Beatty who initiates the voyage , but a Professor Livingston ( Crauford Kent ) who theorizes that a place exists where animals native to both Africa and India live together . That leg of the journey takes place aboard a schooner directed by Captain Robinson ( Edward LeSaint ) , who for good measure drags his daughter Ruth ( Cecilia Parker ) along . Ruth is technically Beatty's fianc√©e , but since he can't tear himself away from his lions and tigers , he quite literally misses the boat . Beatty forms his own expedition to Kamor to rescue the Robinson's when news of their disappearance arrives . Their trip aboard a dirigible also meets with disaster , but at least they make it to their destination . What I found amazing was that two different parties set out for a largely mythical land , somewhere in a vast ocean ( maybe ) , and they both wind up in exactly the same place . As a romantic , Beatty's a good lion tamer . When he first encounters Ruth , she's about to become lunch for a savage island lion named Sammy . After saving her from a main course , Beatty once again mangles every opportunity to let Ruth know how much he missed her . Instead he's fixated on the incredible wildlife that the island has to offer - sheesh ! Skulking around to make life tough for Beatty is the villain of the piece , a low life named Sharkey ( Warner Richmond ) . Motivated by jealousy and greed , Sharkey does his best to do bodily harm to the boss . Beatty never suspects what a heel he is , but the viewer can only cheer when a savage lion evens the score with the bad guy . If you pay close attention , you might recognize a whiskerless George ( Pre-Gabby ) Hayes aboard the dirigible as one of Beatty's crew . However another future star also makes an early appearance in the movie . The young boy with the dog who's fascinated by Beatty's heroics is none other than Mickey Rooney ! Perhaps the real stars of the movie though are the four footed entertainers themselves , second billed to Beatty as The Hagenbeck Wallace Animals . Truthfully , it's hard to imagine how those jungle scenes were created , especially the very realistic battle between a lion and tiger . I imagine some stock footage was used , but it's difficult at times to draw a line between the staged and real scenes . A couple of times in the movie , Clyde Beatty makes a reference to "" bring them back alive "" regarding the jungle cats of Kamor . I would be curious to know if there were any conflicts with Beatty contemporary Frank Buck over the phrase , as Buck was an adventurer who captured wild animals for zoos and circus use during the same era . In fact , Buck's film "" Bring ' Em Back Alive "" preceded this one by two years , and the line was one of his trademarks . In any event , "" The Lost Jungle "" is worth a viewing to see the real Clyde Beatty in person , using his skill and resources to tame wild beasts . If nothing else , you won't want to miss that famous stare down .


Text2: Strangers meet - one is very sorry What a wonderful , tense , exciting work Hitchcock's "" Strangers on a Train "" is ! It is also a great testament to the talent of Robert Walker , who came to a sad end the very year this film was released . His Bruno Anthony is brilliant - demented , angry , fussy , charming when necessary , and scary as hell . But there are other wonderful performances in this film - there isn't much point in me telling the story , as many reviewers on this board have done so already . Patricia Hitchcock gives a delightful performance as Anne's sister ( well portrayed by the lovely Ruth Roman ) and makes us wish she had made more films ; Farley Granger , in a role intended for William Holden , is boyishly handsome and likable as tennis player ( soon to be politician ) Guy Haines ; and there are two Hitch favorites , Leo G . Carroll and Una O'Connor , in supporting roles . The finale is one of the most thrilling Hitch ever did , and even after repeated viewings has one squirming in one's seat . I viewed both the British and American versions . The homoeroticism so slightly suggested in the British version was toned down in the American initial meeting of Guy and Bruno by playing the dialogue faster , and for the American version , Hitchcock tacked on an ending suggestive of the beginning of the film , bringing it full circle . I admit that I actually prefer that to the British ending ( which is the second-last scene in the American version ) . But I like the British scene where Guy and Bruno meet on the train better . Actually , it doesn't matter which one you see - it's a great movie .

262,"Text1: Faintly amusing As a female comedian , Cicely Courtneidge's performing style was somewhere between those of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett . Like both of them , Courtneidge tried to get laughs out of elaborate costumes , in her case involving ludicrous over-sized hats . As with Joan Davis ( who was much funnier and far sexier ) , Courtneidge's comedy routines often involved dancing and slapstick . Her stage and film comedies always involved extremely contrived plot lines . Her career peaked at roughly the same time as Bea Lillie's , and these two performers were frequently compared . But in fact Bea Lillie's most famous routine - - the ' double dozen double damask dinner napkins ' - - was originated by Cicely Courtneidge ( which explains why Lillie never performed this routine in Britain ) . Courtneidge's usual sidekick in her antics was her husband Jack Hulbert , who complemented her in roughly the same way that Desi Arnaz backed Lucille Ball . Hulbert was dark , handsome , urbane , and made some attempt - - never successful - - to keep his wife's antics earthed in reality . Very late in her life , Cicely Courtneidge gave a deeply touching dramatic performance in ' The L-Shaped Room ' , as a wistful old lesbian from the variety halls . Regrettably , this one good performance was preceded by several decades of daft slapstick . It's not surprising that the Monty Python gang used Cicely Courtneidge's name to get a cheap laugh in one of their comedy routines . ' Along Came Sally ' lacks Jack Hulbert but is otherwise absolutely typical of Courtneidge's work . She plays Sally Bird , an Englishwoman who combines the worst traits of the characters played by Gracie Allen ( she's brainless ) and Lucille Ball ( she's got the showbiz bug but is utterly untalented ) . Sally applies for a job in a London nightclub , only to discover that some American gangsters ( with guns ! ) are trying to take over the joint . Of course , she decides to stop them . Somehow , this involves her pretending to be a French performer from the Folies Bergere , cried Mademoiselle Zaza . That name is funnier than anything else in this movie . The most interesting thing about ' Along Came Sally ' is this film's depiction of American gangsters , with all the English stereotypical perceptions of such characters . The gangsters are played tolerably well by American actors , including Sam Hardy as the gang's leader . One of the henchgoons is well-played by Ben Welden , a semi-Edward Brophy character actor from America who got his start in British films before showing up at Warner Brothers . Less well-cast here is Hartley Power , an American character actor long resident in Britain , who usually played ineffectual roles . It doesn't much help that the American gangsters ' dialogue is filled with Anglicisms . As ' Zaza ' , Courtneidge's attempts at a French accent are laughably bad without actually being funny . This entire movie bears an odd resemblance to the Groucho Marx / Carmen Miranda movie ' Copacabana ' , made a few years later . I'll rate ' Along Came Sally ' , mostly because I'm a fan of 1930s comedy in general . This film is firmly in that mode , but not nearly up to the high comedic standards of that decade . For some reason , ' Along Came Sally ' is listed on IMDb as ' Aunt Sally ' . In Britain , an ' Aunt Sally ' is any empty personality that exists for the sole purpose of being knocked down or ridiculed . Well , that description fits this movie .


Text2: ' Skin Deep ' is very shallow . Milton Sills was a moderately handsome , moderately talented actor who attained a moderately successful level of stardom in silent films . In silent days , the threshold of stardom was a lot lower , because movies could be produced very cheaply , and there were many low-budget production companies dedicated to grinding out films that consistently starred a specific actor . . . usually either the owner of the production company , or his wife . ' Skin Deep ' is a low-budget character study which tells a story that manages to be fairly unusual yet utterly predictable . Milton Sills is only barely recognisable under heavy makeup as Bud Doyle , a man ugly of face and also ugly of soul . Doyle is a common criminal : not even a crimelord , mind you , but just a cheap thug . The heavy-handed scenario indicates that Doyle has no alternative to a life of crime , because he's so ugly that nobody will trust him with honest employment . It's interesting to see Sills going against his normal casting and playing a criminal . However , he clearly wants to retain some audience sympathy , so the script is careful to establish that Doyle is a pawn of nastier and more powerful crooks , such as Boss McQuarg . ( Would anybody ever trust somebody cried Boss McQuarg ? ) After committing various crimes , Doyle crosses paths with kindly Dr Langdon , who has a theory that good-looking people are treated better by society than ugly people ( no comment ) . Langdon performs plastic surgery on Doyle , who comes out of it looking like Milton Sills . He rushes off to Hollywood and gets a job as Milton Sills's stunt double . . . no , I'm joking , but that would have been a more imaginative ( and less predictable ) ending than what happens next . SPOILERS COMING . The newly-handsome Doyle straight away renounces his life of crime , helping the authorities to round up McQuarg and Doyle's other criminal cronies . Happy endings all round , and one thing is clear : now that Doyle has movie-star looks , there are no possible obstacles to his success in life . There are absolutely no surprises in ' Skin Deep ' , and it doesn't help that the intertitles are so elaborate that they distract from the by-the-numbers story . Oh , blimey ! I have very mixed feelings about this film . On one level , it seems gobsmackingly shallow in telling us that ugly people have a harder time of it than lookers . On the other hand , has any movie ( or other narrative work ) ever really dealt with this subject properly ? We DO tend to react to people based upon their looks . . . not only in real life , but in the movies we watch . Polanski's ' Compulsion ' is a good example : it's a harrowing study of one woman's descent into madness , but we eagerly watch this movie because it stars the stunningly beautiful Catherine Deneuve , who is extremely easy on the eyes . If the same film had starred a much less attractive actress - - or a man , in a comparable situation - - we would likely be far less eager to watch it . ' Skin Deep ' really has nothing to say that hasn't been said elsewhere . On the other hand , it says something that we really need to be told , over and over : judge people by their deeds , not their appearance . I'll give ' Skin Deep ' credit for good intentions , and it's well-directed by Lambert Hillyer , whose career deserves to be much better known . I'll rate this movie .

Text2: A Nutshell Review : Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus : Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour 3 Alright , I have to confess that I have no clue as to who Hannah Montana is , except that she is some "" it "" girl with some links to Disney , and was spoofed in Superhero Movie . She's a character played by Miley Cyus , daughter of Billy Ray Cyrus , who has to don a long and silky blonde wig to play her alter ego , and perhaps the only time I've seen Miley perform , was lending her non singing voice in Bolt . So I was precisely the proverbial fish out of water who knew zilch about the influence of Miley's reach , and know nothing too about the songs in both Montana and Cyrus ' discography . But of course that didn't persuade me otherwise not to go for this concert movie to find out a lot more in under 90 minutes , and being a 3D movie provided extra reason to do so as well . Being what would be my first 3D concert movie , the depth of field here worked wonders in tricking your senses that you were there at the performance , and every hand that shot up to wave about , or a pop of a head because of enthusiastic fans jumping up and down , would have you either want to reach out and slap them , or like the kids in the audience , they too were lured to mimic such typical enjoyment as if they were there , swaying , dancing , running around , doing cartwheels even ( ! ) just in front of the screen . These kids provided an additional D with their honest , devil-may-care participation . One too would expect just performance of a number after performance , and the only truly 3D-ish moments was the drummer who executed tossing his drumstick into the air , and with Miley herself throwing one right toward the camera , which made you cringe . Other than that , there's nothing unusual , and the documentary aspect of preparing for her concert turned out to be rather plain as well , beginning with designing the stage and the moves on a mock location , before wrapping everything after a full dress rehearsal for the actual performing location . Expect a number of talking heads from parents to co-performers peppering this concert movie , though there's absolutely nothing scandalous being said , more like plenty of pats on the back . Of the "" two "" performers here , personally I preferred Miley Cyrus ' turn rather than Hannah Montana , which I felt was a little bit fake to begin with , and of the songs performed , I had preferred Cyrus ' selection over Montana's . Then again , what would I know , since they're essentially the same person , and the age group this is targeted at , would have more discerning opinions . I'm just there to soak up the atmosphere , really . Give us U23D !

265,"Text1: A wonderful film , . . . one of the better war films While this isn't my favorite soviet WWII film ( that would be the simple and super-effective BALLAD OF A SOLDIER ) , it is exceptional and well worth seeing . Veronika and Boris are young and in love . Unfortunately , just before they marry , WWII comes along and despite their plans , Boris responds to the call of duty and volunteers to fight . They are both heartbroken , but duty is duty . Shortly after this , Veronika's parents are killed in an air raid , so she moves in with Boris ' family . At this point , the movie becomes a bit confusing and this is one case where I really wish the film had been more explicit . Boris ' no-good cousin is living at the apartment along with the family and during an air raid , he attacks Veronika and begins kissing her despite her protests . Then , inexplicably , in the next scene they announce they are getting married ! Either he won her over with passion or he raped her and she oddly felt that since he violated her she should marry him ( that's twisted logic ) . It makes a big difference - - if she just lost interest in Boris that easily , it really doesn't make sense since they were so in love and after marrying , she acts like she loves him as much as ever . But , if she was raped , she is a far more sympathetic and tragic figure . Now apart from that , the movie is marvelous . The camera-work ( especially when Boris is shot and he is imagining the wedding that never was ) , acting and production was amazing . So much so , by the end I really had to fight back the tears ( after all , I'm a guy and guys NEVER let themselves cry , . . . except when Jim Brown gets killed in THE DIRTY DOZEN ) . A very loving and beautiful film that greatly humanizes the face and cost of war .


Text2: Talk about warped ! Brilliant , scary , funny soap opera ( sort of ) of an extremely dysfunctional hospital in the Netherlands . Yeah , it's 4 hours and a half . . . yeah it's all subtitles . . . yeah , it has no ending . . . but who cares ? The film basically LOOKS different ! It always looks drab ( purposely ) , and some camera-work that's very shaky but it perfectly fits the tone of the film . It's basically a combination of all different genres - - horror film , love story , sex , blackmail , malpractice and two mildly retarted dishwashers who act as a Greek chorus . The acting ranges from OK to excellent . The plot twists and turns and weaves - - I was never bored ! One complaint - - reading subtitles for so long can strain your eyes . I first saw it at a revival theatre . They showed it straight through with NO breaks ! No one left and the audience applauded long and loud after the showing . I walked out exhausted and laughing at the same time . It's unlike ANYTHING you've seen before . This is continuted in "" Riget 2 "" which still has no ending . It was going to be wrapped up in a third miniseries but two of the main actors died and the director said he couldn't do it without them . So they'll never be an ending but you won't care . You'll just be astounded by what you do see . Highly recommended .

Unfortunately he then meets the real love of his life called Erica . When I say "" Unfortunately "" I meant unfortunately for Matt and his vow of celibacy . Unfortunately for me I decided to watch this film because there was nothing else on . I was under the impression that 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS was going to be a romantic comedy , something fairly gentle and forgettable but not totally unwatchable but alas it's a sex comedy and there is a difference . With this type of movie it tries to be gross and juvenile and for the first half it succeeds ( Not my type of movie ) but strangely for the second half it does try to be somewhat romantic which means for the lads who might have enjoyed the crass humour earlier in the movie have to watch a relationship movie and I guess all the girlies who watched because the of touted pretty boy lead must have been put off with the gross humour at the start so as is often the case when you make a movie trying to appeal to both males and females you end up - Like a poor bisexual lover - satisfying neither camp Josh Hartnett ? He starred in PEARL HARBOR which through no fault of his own was one of the biggest piles of horse manure that Hollywood produced in years , yeah he was fairly impressive in BLACK HAWK DOWN but the real star of BHD was Ridley Scott's technical achievements . With a movie like 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS the whole film rests on the leads shoulders and it's fairly clear that Hartnett can't carry a movie on his performance alone . I shouldn't condemn him too much since the script is very poor and does raise some idiotic questions like if Matt is a devout catholic then we does he have sex outside of marriage and use a condom ?


Text2: Who ( Or What ) Is R . E . M . A . K . ? Linda Thorson hardly features in this episode . ' Tara ' goes off on holiday early on , and does not reappear until the end , when the mission is over . In her place we get the lovely Jennifer Croxton ( later to co-star with future ' Avengers ' babe Joanna Lumley in the sitcom ' Its Awfully Bad For Your Eyes Darling ' ) as ' Lady Diana Forbes-Blakeney ' . In his book on ' The Avengers ' , Dave Rogers wonders whether Lady Di might have been a try-out for a new leading lady just in case the show was recommissioned without Linda . As it turned out , it was not . She has her fans , but I am not one of them . She has little rapport with Macnee , appearing to have wandered out out of one of the Monty Berman / Dennis Spooner I .

British agents are turning up dead , wrapped in polythene , and - this is the really perplexing part - having been first shot , stabbed , garroted , drowned etc . Yet their clothes are intact ! What's going on ? There is not really much of a plot here . One agent dies , another investigates , he in turn dies , another goes after him and dies , and so on , a bit like a game of ' Follow My Leader ' . Among the victims is Anthony Valentine , on the cusp of stardom in ' Callan ' and ' Colditz ' . Harry Towb has a good role as a traitorous British agent who keeps turning up on a deserted film set with arrows / knives sticking out his chest ! Comedy actor Richard Wattis is around too . The centre of the mysterious goings-on is a factory . At its heart is R . E . M . A . K . - a computer programmed to kill . Anyone unlucky to find himself inside the place will be forced to pass through a series of brightly coloured rooms ( a fact that would have been lost on British viewers watching in black and white ) , each equipped with a death device . R . E . M . A . K . ' s human associates are played by William Franklyn and Grant Taylor , who talk about the machine as though it were a real person . This was Cliff Owen's only episode . He directed two of the three Morecambe & Wise movies ( including the best one - ' That Riviera Touch ' ) and the cheeky ( in more ways than one ) Dick Emery comedy ' Ooh You Are Awful ' . He does a good job on ' Killer ' , keeping it slick , fast-moving and entertaining , and one wishes he had done more . The climax in the factory - as Steed alone tackles the computer - is wonderful . Had Tara not gone off with her bucket and spade , this would have been a classic episode . The ' all-powerful computer ' idea would be reused in the ' New Avengers ' adventure ' Complex ' .

The 80s allowed it to be a masterpiece ! The special effects are spectacular and I still think they are as good as the ones used currently ! I like the actors and the characters they play ! Fisher Stevens is hilarious ! John Stockwell played his part very good . Danielle von Zerneck and Raphael Sbarge put on good performances ! I really liked Richard Masur in the movie . His character Detective Jack Nulty was really a bad @ $$ and a ruthless one at that ! His accent and attitude was just so cool ! I always like to see Barry Corbin in the movie . Dennis Hopper's character Bob Roberts was colorful and intelligent ! This may sound strange but I believe My Science Project could be arguably his best movie ! The laughing bum character was funny ! Look for RoboCop's Robert DoQui and Big Trouble In Little China's Al Leong ! The budget of the film is big and I have always liked what it has in store ! Another thing I love about My Science Project is the score by Peter Bernstein ! The music fits the film perfectly and the theme it has is just phenomenally spooky ! Its so great ! In My opinion This movie has very good acting by the talented actors , a cool story , spectacular effects , a wonderful 80s feel , and just about anything that you could put in a movie ! I don't know why this classic movie hasn't received the attention it deserves I mean with all of the things it has I would think this movie would be considered one of the greats but sadly that hasn't happened . I personally think My Science Project is a classic movie that I believe is one of greatest of all time ! It is always great to watch . If anyone reads this and hasn't seen My Science Project before then I strongly recommend you go rent it and then buy it ! Its a true classic !

This is of course not the first film in history and presumably the Edison Manufacturing Company did dozens of test before actually shooting this and of course also shot "" Monkeyshines , No . 1 "" , 2 and 3 prior to this but it is the first film that was shown to a wide audience and press , at The National Federation of Women's Clubs , through a motion picture exhibition device the Kinetoscope , an invention of mostly William K . L . Dickson that let a strip of several images passing front of an illuminated lens behind a spinning wheel . Therefor this 3 second short plays an important part in movie history , as being the very first to be shown to an audience . The motions are perfect , though because of the shooting speed it all seems to occur in slow motion . There are no jerky movements and also the images is surprisingly clear . The film was shot with a Kinetograph , another William K . L . Dickson invention . He therefor is also credited as the inventor of the motion picture camera . The color white is shiny and the less dark colors of Dickson's clothing distinct itself well from the pitch black background used to film this . You can clearly see Dickson's face and also the more detailed look of his hair . Still I feel they could had done a bit more with the movement in this film . Show the audience some more of the possibilities of moving images . Instead now basically all Dickson does , is bring his hat from his one hand to the other , as a sort of wave toward the audience and he moves his head slightly , supposedly as a small nod toward the audience but that isn't all too clear to see . In a way this movie is a great metaphor for William K . L . Dickson and Thomas A . Edison literal greeting and welcoming us to the world of film . It perhaps provides the movie with just as much impact and significance , as it did 116 years ago .


Text2: James Cagney goes on the dancing tour . James Cagney is best known for his tough characters - and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot ' soft ' characters in his career . This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney would star in . Cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing . And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it . He plays the role with a lot of confidence . He apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time , so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career . He obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in . The movie is directed by Lloyd Bacon , who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre . His earliest ' 30's musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as "" 42nd Street "" . His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really . ' 30's musicals never were really about its singing , this was something that more featured in ' 40's and later made musicals , mainly from the MGM studios . As usual it has a light and simple story , set in the musical world , that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way . It nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch . So do the characters and actors that are portraying them . Sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie , when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines . The musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done , even though I'm not a too big fan of the genre itself . Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty . he often played little boys / babies / mice and whatever more early on in his career , including the movie musical "" Gold Diggers of 1933 "" , of one year earlier .

Text2: A Gothic Thriller Delivered with Panache A Gothic Thriller Delivered with Panache , November 17 , 2005Reviewer : Grady Harp ( Los Angeles , CA United States ) - See all my reviews Writer Ehren Kruger ( ' The Ring ' movies , ' The Brothers Grimm ' ) has supplied Director Iain Softley ( ' Wings of the Dove ' ) with a sound story from which Softley has created a satisfyingly dark film about death and dying and Hoodoo magic in the swampy region of Louisiana . Without resorting to the usual stock gimmicks , THE SKELETON KEY works on many levels to frighten and entertain and it succeeds ! Caroline ( Kate Hudson ) is a beautiful 25-year old whose guilt over her absence from her father's deathbed has driven her to seek work in nursing homes ( the film's opening sequence with Caroline reading to a dying man is elegant and touching and quite timely ) and ultimately to hospice care . Answering an ad in the paper for a hospice nurse takes her to a strange old Southern mansion in which live the Devereauxs - Violet ( Gena Rowlands ) and her bedridden husband Ben ( John Hurt ) . Caroline passes her interview and at the warm insistence of the family lawyer Luke ( Peter Sarsgaard ) she takes the job . Violet is a frightening old lady who entrusts Caroline with a skeleton key which opens the doors of all 30 rooms of the creaky , musty mansion - except for one door in the attic . Noting there are no mirrors in the house , Caroline begins to investigate the place and Ben's seemingly terrified state and discovers the forbidden room contains elements of dark magic . She seeks information from her close friend Jill ( Joy Bryant ) who skeptically informs her that the symbols and paraphernalia Caroline has discovered are factors of Hoodoo - a strange magic whose multi-ethnic beginnings are in New Orleans . Slowly Caroline challenges Violet for information and finding none , seeks the advice of a Hoodoo woman ( Fahnlohnee R . Harris ) for answers . The bizarre dark secrets of the old mansion and the Devereaux couple ultimately come into focus and it is up to Caroline to break some spells . . . . if that is possible . With a cast this fine it would be surprising if the film didn't fly and each of the actors creates a credible creature that involves us from the beginning . Yes , the horror story is accompanied by rain storms and thunder storms that serve to heighten the tension and the pacing by director Softley keeps the audience alert and suspicious and ultimately surprised . This is one of the better thrillers released in some time . Recommended especially to devotees of the thriller genre ! Grady Harp

270,"Text1: The first submarine photoplay ever filmed ! When I read during the opening credits of the 1916 adaptation of Jules Verne's "" 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea , "" immediately I assumed the frame of mind that I always do when watching early films , so as not to criticize it's lack of special effects or advanced film techniques . Immediately I was immensely impressed at the transfer from book to film , as the film followed the story closely and faithfully . Unfortunately , this only lasted for about the first ten minutes of the film , which ultimately proved to take Verne's work and butcher it in every way imaginable . Probably the most jarring change to the story is that they decided to not only adapt 20 , 00 Leagues , but also another Verne novel , Mysterious Island , into this film . So the result is that you have two totally different stories taking place that don't at all seem to fit together , until finally they come together in the bizarre conclusion , which makes absolutely no sense in respect to the novel . My current theory is that because so much of the original novel of 20 , 000 Leagues was decades beyond the reach of the filmmakers to be able to put on screen , so they probably had to look to an entirely separate novel just to have enough material to fill a full length film . Sadly , it reminds me of those terrible songs that radio stations sometimes come up with when they combine two popular songs together that have a similar beat , resulting in something that is not quite equal to but definitely less than the originals . One such bizarre hybrid comes to mind involving Closer , by Nine Inch Nails , and Garbage's # 1 Crush . The basic , basic , basic plot structure remains , but literally 95 % of the story is gone . There is rumor of a massive sea monster and the crew of the Abraham Lincoln set off to capture it . Strangely enough , at one point it passes a mere few meters from their ship in broad daylight , and the crew can clearly see the steel plated sides and the rivets holding it together , even the bridge and periscope , and yet they still think it's a sea monster . I'll attribute that to the inability to emulate the Nautilus's movements as described in the novel , but in this way we also have to sacrifice the entirety of the ship's glorious design and function , which is not even described in dialogue . For the most part , we see a single room , which looks like an old Victorian bedroom with one wall that looks like it belongs in a boiler room . Probably the worst crime that the film commits is in the character of Captain Nemo . Granted , Nemo in the novel is not exactly the most charming and charismatic man , but it is as if they set out in this film to create a man as far from the original description as humanly possible . As a result , we get a bizarre spectacle that looks like a disgruntled Santa Clause in blackface . And not only that , throughout the film he gives several displays of compassion that the original Nemo would have scoffed at . Indeed , at one point , he torpedoes a ship , and then afterwards and then almost faints as he worries about the safety of the victims . What the hell ? ? And incidentally , Verne's Nautilus didn't have torpedoes , although he did use it as a ramming weapon . In the film's defense , the underwater photography is truly impressive given the time that it was filmed , and surely knocked 1916 audiences , most of whom had probably never seen the underwater world , out of their seats . This would certainly explain the seemingly endless lingering on these scenes . Their is also an interesting allusion to another Verne novel , as at one point in their underwater tour they come across a decayed shipwreck , which Nemo describes as "" the wreck of an old blockade runner . "" And the worst thing about the bizarre personification of Nemo in this film is the backstory that was invented for the film which , amazingly , is introduced with this intertitle - "" Captain Nemo reveals the tragic secret of his life , which Jules Verne never told . "" What follows is the most bizarre story imaginable , which claims that Nemo was previously some kind of empirical royalty who lived in an

Text2: "" Small minds breed small-minded superstitions . "" Famous for coming from the same minds as brought us the disturbingly good Saw films , Dead Silence reveals a deeper fascination ( or obsession ) with dolls than those movies initially let on . This time we have another sort of murder mystery , in the sense that we have Donnie Wahlberg as a detective investigating what seems to be an open and shut murder case , albeit an increasingly bizarre one . It takes place is the satisfactorily eerie-named Raven's Fair when a young couple mysteriously receive a frighteningly creepy ventriloquist's doll on their doorstep with no return address . As they try to figure out where it came from , the wife ends up dead and of course , the young husband the prime suspect in her murder , given that he foolishly keeps blaming the doll for her death . Not a real smart move if you want the police to give you some slack , for crying out loud . Wahlberg overdoes the incessant , cynical skepticism about lead character Jamie's story about the killer doll , especially since the movie exists in that horror movie world where even places like police stations and hospitals are either the creepiest places in the world or haven't paid their electricity bills in some months . Doesn't he realize he's in a movie ? Nonetheless , we still expect something big from these guys , after all , Saw burst onto the scene like a freight train and no one saw it coming . Now they go from that to the killer doll sub-genre , which needless to say has been done to death for decades . So we are waiting for something new and exciting and unfortunately it just isn't there . There are numerous plot points that don't make a lot of sense , despite a few rather ambitious branches of the premise , and while some of the sight gags are fairly effective and the creepy atmosphere is undeniable , they shockingly forget the critical horror movie rule that CGI shots are just not scary . I'm going to make a bold statement , there has never once in cinematic history been a horror film that made a CGI shot scary . It's never happened . If you disagree , let me know , I'd love to see it happen , but it definitely doesn't happen here , and if an old woman sticking her foot long tongue through a doll's head is not scary then I don't know what is . The death scenes themselves are effectively creepy , as they have added the little tidbit that victims tongues are torn out . Given the fact that that is one of the selling points should tell you exactly what kind of horror movie this is . Nevertheless , the scares are pretty light . The movie's tagline says , "" Whatever you do , don't scream . "" I don't think that will be a problem . . .

271,"Text1: Amusing , but only up to a point . . . strives to be excruciatingly funny . . . Preston Sturgess has Rex Harrison emoting at a frantic pace , so much so that the others in the cast seem barely able to keep up with him . Rudy Vallee does , and gives another one of his expert comic performances as Harrison's stuffy brother-in-law who claims to hate music . Barbara Lawrence as his sarcastic wife has a few good one-liners that she tosses at Vallee . And Linda Darnell does a good job of showing slavish devotion to her brilliant conductor husband Harrison . But therein lies the weakness in the premise . Darnell is so obviously devoted ( to the extreme and with extreme patience ) to her temperamental artist of a husband , that it is inconceivable that he would , for one moment , suspect her of infidelity based on hearsay and immediately have her followed by detectives . There are three flashbacks - - with at least one of them being very clever while the others don't quite fit the bill . But the final scene ( back to reality ) is an uneven blend of slapstick and sight gags that simply go on too long before the windup which has him adoring his wife again . Not Sturgess at his best and it's the script that's the main weakness because the acting is fine . Rex Harrison seems to be doing a rehearsal for Henry Higgins and Linda Darnell is charming ( if unbelievably patient ) as the doting wife . Good support from Lionel Stander , Barbara Lawrence and Kurt Kreuger , as well as Edgar Kennedy . Not as excruciatingly funny as it strives to be with a weak finale . A big bonus is the effective use it makes of classical music .


Text2: I Guess The Premise Was Good minor spoilers Without doubt the best scene in DAMNATION ALLEY is the one set in the control room as the airforce men stand in stunned silence as the major cities of the USA are nuked . I don't think as some critics have said that this scene is bland , it's because the people in the control room are shocked that world war 3 has broken out and realise that civilisation has ended , it's a very understated and haunting scene . Alas however as soon as the exposition subtitles come up ( And very purple prose they are too . They match the colour of the sky ) the film quickly falls apart . Two of the characters have now left the airforce which doesn't strike me as being logical . After a major event , and they don't come much more major than global thermonuclear conflict I'd have thought , wouldn't martial law be introduced ? If so would servicemen be allowed to leave the forces when they felt like it ? And aren't any men on the base related to anyone ? This really stuck in my mind that no one ever mentions loved ones who must have been wiped out during the war . Maybe they were married to the guests on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW ? If so I guess nuclear holocaust does have its plus pointsThe film then turns into an epic quest adventure but if you're expecting LORD OF THE RINGS don't hold your breathe because it all becomes both silly and boring B movie stuff with the only point of interest being the line about killer cockroaches which made me laugh out loud . And I felt cheated by the upbeat happy ending . Strangely enough if you look up the resumes of the two screenwriters you'll find they have a very good track record of writing intelligent involving scripts so what went wrong here ? One last point . Watch the scene where Jan Michael Vincent is riding about the desert evading the crap superimposed mutant scorpians . He's supposedly driving around with a mannequin on the back of his motorbike but if you look closely just before he throws it off you can quite clearly see it's an actress / stuntwomen of latino / native American ethnicity

Swann accidentally stumbles across a top secret government base that's conducting a time travel experiment and gets transported back to 1877 . Grimy , vicious desperado Peter Coyote and his two dumb , craven , greasy , unwashed scuzzbag partners ( marvelously played by the ever-grubby Tracey Walter and an uncharacteristically nasty Richard Masur ) want to steal Swann's wheels .

The fantastic premise is given a semblance of gritty , lived-in plausibility thanks to the brightly conceived script , believable reactions the 18th century characters have to both Swann and his motorcycle , sound acting from a top-rate cast , and especially director William Dear's harsh , rough around the edges , very dingy and fiercely unromanticized evocation of the Old West .

Kudos are also in order for the funky special effects which include a gnarly stop-motion animation one-eyed rat monster , a giant spider , and the huge pulsating alien brain . Aage Wiltrup's bright , sharp color cinematography and Ronald Stein's moody score are both up to speed . The thrilling mondo destructo climax hits the stirring spot while the groovy lounge ending credits theme song is a total swingin ' gas .

A group of young people are heading somewhere , one pair in the car ahead , & that car has a flat , and our film opens with the young man , Woody , pushing the tire along looking for a service station . He finds a seemingly abandoned place , and yet hears voices and investigates , and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts . Along comes the rest of the young folks ( in a VW Thing ) and they pick up Woody's girlfriend , and find this very same place , Slausen's Oasis , or some such thing . . and then Mr . Slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream . Of course , the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that point , so odd Mr . Slausen ( Chuck Connors ) offers his help . Mr . Slausen has a museum , with lots of wax figures , and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house , where he says Davey lives . And who is Davey ? Why , Davey Crockett , he says . . . but if it were Davey Crockett , they'd all probably be safer . The girls are left alone while Slausen goes to help with fixing the car , but of course curiosity gets the better of one & she goes to investigate , and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named . . . Davey . What follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one , they're taken prisoner by Davey , who says he's Slausen's brother . One girl ( kidnapped earlier ) is treated to a plaster facial , which results in her death when it covers up her air supply . At any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind ( but weird ) Mr . Slausen is not exactly what he appears to be . A good , creepy late 70's horror flick , and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere . .


Text2: Come on ride the train , come ride it . . . Before you start asking - no , it's not porn , gay or otherwise , though those were the first words out of my mother's mouth when I told her I would be going to see this now cult-ish horror movie . This is another example of Lion's Gate acting nefarious with their distribution . They probably aren't as ' wtf'-like as Fox at the moment , but while they bask in their self-imposed glow of Saw flicks and Jason Statham vehicles , they dumped Midnight Meat Train in a manner not unlike ( speaking of Fox ) Idiocracy . The film was technically released in about a handful of ( i . e . 100 ) theaters this summer , practically all of them in 1-dollar joints in towns I've never heard of and nowhere near my digs in North NJ / NYC . It's made $34 , 000 in its theatrical run , which is somewhat impressive considering a ) the total lack of any real advertising , either around the "" from the mind of Clive Barker "" angle or just that it's a kick-ass-looking horror flick about a guy killing people on trains , and b ) it opened in 1-dollar theaters for a very limited run . So suffice to say it's a bittersweet coda to this dumped-on movie from Lion's Gate that it finally screened for two aptly scheduled Midnight screenings at a theater in Manhattan - ironically costing us all about 8 or 9 dollars MORE than it did those lucky dozen or so that caught it a couple of months ago - and at the same time , thankfully , is a worthwhile midnight-movie . Kitamura's adaptation of the Barker story ( un-read by me ) is a slight throwback to grisly 80s serial killer flicks ( while I couldn't think of one after it ended , with a friend of mine repeatedly stating "" it's like Saw , only good "" which I could understand , I'm sure there are suggestions open to comparison ) as it unapologetically takes its time showing us unnecessary killing scenes with lots of blood , gore , meat and Vinnie Jones as the killer . It is , in all actuality , a definite must see for every geeky horror buff you might have ever come across , or are yourself . It's about an aspiring photographer ( Bradley Cooper ) who is trying to impress a chic , artsy curator ( Brooke Shields ) with his photographs , but she wants more - more of the actual blood and guts and other things that he hasn't captured yet . After clicking at the right time and right place with a model almost being attacked and raped , she's finally impressed - but she wants more . This leads Cooper to finding a subject coming out of the subway one night : a man in a business suit , crew-cut , and a stare that could cut glass . This is Vinnie Jones , uttering only one word in his entire performance and thus making it perhaps his most bad-ass yet ( which considering that it's "" I'm the Juggernaut , Bitch ! "" , it's saying something ) . Now , saying that this is a kick-ass genre flick doesn't exactly mean it's a very good movie . It's not . It's got some pretty blah dialog , the characters are only interesting when serving the ( bleeped ) - up nature of the plot , and there's even some poorly shot CGI of the trains moving through the tunnels . You'll also be saying "" wtf "" every few seconds in the final act , though that's a big part of the fun . It's not for the squeamish : this contains countless bodies strung up by meat-hooks , blood flowing so much that people usually end up slipping hilariously in the train , and even some whacked-out creatures reminiscent of The Descent . . . only , of course , these wait for their flesh in a slightly different manner , and end up raising some questions for the viewer once it ends . Midnight Meat Train is kick-ass for all the reasons that people love pointlessly violent horror movies that occasionally feature the likes of Ted Raimi getting beaten to a bloody pulp with a hook . If you are that kind of horror fan , who wanted something aside from complete unintentional hilarity and abhorrent contrivance with the Saw movies and harkon longingly back to crazy butcher-themed flicks ( and , perhaps , are looking for some influence of Blowup from time to time ) , this is","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Martin Scorsese , never one to fear boldness , tackles Edith Wharton's classic and revels in its sumptuous excess . The production and costume design alone are worth the price of admission , but Scorsese does Wharton's themes and characterizations justice as well . That most chameleonic of chameleon actors Daniel Day-Lewis is perhaps a bit too old for his role , but Day-Lewis can do anything and he's great here . Michelle Pfeiffer's natural coldness as an actress serves her well in this particular role .

A year later , July 4th , those who made this pact of silence will face an unknown psycho , dressed in the fisherman's slacks and wielding a wood-handled hook , dying one by one . Anyone with knowledge of the tragedy , keeping a vow of silence , are in grave danger . More of the same except this one has a cast of no-names and the killer in a fisherman's outfit , stabbing the victims with his hook whose identity is a real howler .

It'll feel like you're watching a cheaper , inferior version of "" I Know What You Did Last Summer "" . "" I know what you did last summer "" is spoken throughout as if the filmmakers insisted on reminding us of what movie we were watching .

While the film is interesting there are a lot of things that make absolute no sense in the way the director , working with Brandon Cole in the screen play , presents the story and then proceeds to solve it in the next 90 minutes . Mr . Rockwell has to be congratulated in employing these young talent . Given the choice between a studio film and and independent one , I will always choose the latter one . That said , there are a lot of unanswered questions in the film . We have no inkling at the beginning of the film that Timmy is a sick boy , he is suddenly in the hospital where a donor has been matched and will undergo a kidney transplant . The donor is Slovo , a man who was hit by the boy's father , and it's an obnoxious man . The quest for the search of this man , who disappeared from the hospital , is at the core of the action .

There is the rapper with the gorgeous girlfriend who can't carry a tune who come to help the boy and his father and in the process take us into the streets of a seedy section of town and end up in the rapper's mansion where everyone jumps in the pool . There are a lot things that don't make sense , but we go along the ride because the director , at times , shows signs of brilliant film making , but ultimate , the movie leaves us questioning a lot of things as to why they happen .

Itstill might be him ( it was something else Sezuki ) , and I amassuming it was as I write this review . Having totally fallen in love with Branded to Kill and , to a slightlylesser extant , but not too much lesser , with Tokyo Drifter , I wasoverjoyed to find this at the video store ( I remembered havingheard at one point of its being on video ) . And I was even moreoverjoyed to watch it . It's an amazing film which I would placeslightly ahead of Tokyo Drifter and Branded to Kill , giving it a . The film opens right after the end of WWII with a young womanstarving in the street ( not something I would expect from the twoprevious yakuza films I've seen of Seijun's ) . She meets up with agroup of four prostitutes who allow her to work with them . They areself-sufficient and need no pimp . They keep themselves in linewith the threat of torture if any one of them ever sleeps with a manwithout accepting money . Of course , you can see the possibility forexploitation , and there is exploitation , believe me . After a while , arobust thug ( Jo Shishido of Branded to Kill , cheekbones and all ) shows up in their crumbling household . They respect himbecause he resists the GIs who try to keep the law in their city ( never specified ) and those Japanese people who cooperate withthem . They're also all attracted to him . After this is developed , thereisn't much more plot - only a couple of events happen afterwards . More or less , it is a character study and also a sociological study . The anti-Americanism is very interesting to see . Seijun was asoldier in the Japanese army himself and , although I could easilypoint out that , hey , you started it , it's easy to understand what hemust have felt after he and his comrades lost a war , what it wouldhave done to the male psyche as well as the female ( this film wasmade about twenty years afterwards ) . Some people would naturally hate this film because it mixes itsstyles , often very harshly . It's really nothing that Godard wouldn'thave done - in fact , it's actually something that Godard , despite mygreat affection for him and his films , could never have achieved ; hewas far too interested in subverting filmic conventions and toounconcerned with making interesting films at times . It is filmed incolor , and its art design / cinematography / costuming , everythingtechnical , is color coordinated in a way akin to something like a1950s musical . Four of the five prostitutes are color-coated andthere is , for instance , an amazing scene where these four color - specific hookers muse over Shishido alone against a setdesigned only in their colors . Often the film is quite melodramatic , almost like a Douglas Sirk film . At other times , it is something likesado-masochistic porno , especially during the torture scenes . There are scenes akin to the brutality in Tokyo Drifter and Brandedto Kill ; there is some major brutality to women ( sometimesinflicted by women ) , so if you're particularly sensitive to that , youmight want to avoid this . Also , if that's a problem with you , takespecial measures to avoid Branded to Kill . You might want to skipover this next description tot he next paragraph if you very easily getsick or if you're a militant animal rights activist , but there is astunning scene where Jo Shishido slaughters a live cow . I'm prettysure it's a real scene of slaughter . If not , then it's a damned goodfacsimile . If you were horrified at the real scenes of sacrifice inApocalypse Now , you might just want to avoid this film altogether . The bottom line for me is that this film is a masterpiece .

Text2: A genuine oddity Peter Weir made his directorial debut with this truly bizarre and unique blackly humorous multi-genre pastiche that's a compellingly novel and singular blend of horror , Western and sci-fi conventions mixed together into a jarringly offbeat whole . A pleasant , mild-mannered American tourist ( a sweetly amiable performance by Terry Camilleri ) finds himself trapped in a remote backwoods Australian hamlet after he narrowly survives a car crash . The naive , gullible yank soon discovers that things are not exactly quite right and okay in the deceptively sleepy burg . For starters , that car crash wasn't an accident ; it was deliberately staged by the resourceful and enterprising townspeople who eke out a living by salvaging car parts from wrecked vehicles . Then there's a resident mad scientist who's fond of experimenting on car crash survivors , turning the hapless folks into mute lobotomized imbeciles called "" veggies . "" And the local drag-racing teenage hooligans are getting increasingly out of control , carousing about in their lethal , garishly made-up cars ( one sports spikes all along its body like a porcupine ! ) until the wee hours of the morning and making a real nuisance of themselves . The town's friendly , but ineffectual mayor ( winningly played by John Mellion ) offers Camilleri the plum job of parking superintendent in a desperate attempt to restore law and order . The quirky , imaginative script by Weir , Keith Gow and Piers David ingeniously uses the oddball premise as an ideal springboard for barbed social commentary on the perils of cross country traveling , the very modern dangers the automobile poses to quiet everyday life , how isolated communities cut off from the rest of civilization can easily degenerate into barbarism and lawlessness , the extreme measures impoverished people will resort to in order to get by in life , and even a wacky generation gap conflict pitting uptight , disciplined , morally rigid adults against rowdy , uninhibited nihilist youth . Weirs ' direction is precariously pitched between the grimly horrific and the darkly facetious , boldly maintaining an uneasy tone which keeps the viewer constantly off guard and gives the irregular proceedings a potently unsettling weirded-out edge . John McLean's grainy , luridly grungy cinematography allows the Australian outback to take on a scary , nightmarishly surreal aura while Bruce Smeaton's sometimes dissonant , more often strangely jaunty rock-tinged score adds substantially to the pervasively unnerving nuttiness . An authentically grotesque and intriguing one-of-a-kind curio .

Text2: Not Lewton's best film , but a good exhibition of eerie atmosphere The Ghost Ship was put together because RKO pictures wanted another film to be made using the existing sets from their earlier film , Pacific Liner . This shows somewhat , as the film has something of a rushed and unfinished feel to it ; but there's nobody better than Val Lewton for the task of putting together an eerie thriller , and considering the reasons why this was made ; he hasn't done a bad job at all . The film isn't up there with his best work - films such as Cat People , I Walked With a Zombie and The Body Snatcher - but I still rate this as a successful production credit for the man , and as an eerie sea bound thriller ; it definitely works . The plot is simple ( probably as a result of the reason that the film was made ) and it follows a ship whose third mate suspects that the captain may be the one murdering the crew , some members of which have been dying under mysterious circumstances . We then follow a familiar psychological drama formula , which is fleshed out by some set pieces typical of Lewton's films . The atmosphere , as usual with Lewton , is right on cue and makes up the backbone of the movie . The smoky setting compliments the isolation of being at sea nicely , and the film always seems interesting and foreboding for this reason . The story is weak and somewhat dull for the first half hour of the movie - and this is somewhat due to the lack in atmosphere . The first half does treat us to the film's best set-piece - a man being crushed by a huge chain ( no less ! ) - but you'll have to wait until the second half before the movie really picks up . As you would expect from Lewton , the film is never gratuitous , but during the second half the story starts to pick up , and as the tension mounts , director Mark Robson allows the film to reach it's climatic conclusion . Mark Robson isn't the best director that Lewton worked with - and all of his movies have been lesser entries in the great producer's list of film credits , but he knows what he's doing and this is another decent film from him . On the whole - you'll probably want to see the Jacques Tourneur collaborations , along with The Body Snatcher first - but after you've seen those , this is a good place to go next .

Text2: Forgotten Biblical Epic A young American living in France suffers severe emotional trauma after joining the Army during the First World War . Eventually he gains enormous comfort after listening to a saintly old Minister relate the story of NOAH'S ARK & The Great Deluge , showing that the evils of the present day will also be washed away . This movie epic is a wonderful viewing experience , with plenty of romance & excitement . Warner Brothers lavished a great deal of money on the film - and it shows . Produced right at the very cusp of the talkie era , this is a mostly silent film with some talkie sequences - which makes it quite fascinating from a technological point of view . While perhaps it would be easy to laugh at the somewhat gauche vocal efforts of some of the cast , this would be to miss the point . Talking pictures were brand new & the entire society of movie actors were scrambling to learn how to perform in the perplexing new medium . NOAH'S ARK shows the best efforts of these particular actors at that time . Actually , Noah Beery , as the villain , uses his dramatic deep voice to good effect . It was a favorite convention in lavish film epics of the 1920's to tell two concurrent stories : one modern & moralistic , the other from some far distant - and decadent - past . ( DeMille tried this format more than once . ) This gave the filmmaker the opportunity to both preach & serve-up generous quantities of sin . It also gave the actors , as here , the chance to play dual roles - each used as a counterpoint to the other . Rugged George O'Brien & sweet Dolores Costello do fine work as the romantic leads in both stories . Guinn Williams is a stalwart support to O'Brien . Noah Beery is detestable as the wicked villain , and Paul McAllister is memorable as the Minister / Noah . Young Myrna Loy has a small part as a dancer . Scriptural purity is not entirely adhered to in the Noah scenes ; elements from the stories of Moses & Samson are interpolated and far more attention is given to the evil outside the Ark than what went on inside it . The thrilling Deluge scenes are truly epic , however , and were just as dangerous to the extras as they appear .

THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS is okay - John Buchan's novel ( one of several with Richard Hannay as the hero - another is PRESTER JOHN ) has a similar plot to the movie . But SABOTAGE is based on a Joseph Conrad novel , THE SECRET AGENT . SECRET AGENT is based on W . Somerset Maugham's novel ( somewhat based on his experiences as a spy in World War I ) entitled , ASHENDEN , THE SECRET AGENT . Maugham would use the character of Ashenden in some of his later fiction , as a peace time writer . YOUNG AND INNOCENT is based on A SHILLING FOR CANDLES by Josephine Tey . THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is the title of a novel by G . K . CHESTERTON about a socially well-connected man who knows where all the skeletons of the upper crust are buried , but helps keep them buried . It has nothing to do with the plot of the 1934 Hitchcock film . Just why most of his movies changed titles is hard to pinpoint . Obviously box office attraction is involved . SECRET AGENT begins with word ( during World War I ) that Willie Ashenden , the well known writer , is dead . We see a closed coffin wake for the man , and when everyone leaves we discover the coffin is empty . Ashenden has gone undercover to do some espionage for the British military during the First World War . He is assisted by Lorre , nicknamed "" The General "" or "" the Mad Mexican "" ( Lorre is not Mexican in the story ) . They make an odd pair , with Guilgud stiff and proper , and Lorre definitely odd looking . They head for Switzerland , where they meet several people : Carroll , Young , and Percy Marmont ( travelling with is wife and dog ) . Marmont soon appears to be the dangerous German agent that Ashenden and Lorre are to do in . And they do , in the most memorable portion of the film - only to discover subsequently that Marmont was not the spy . Of course , barring Carroll , that leaves only one possibility , so the degree of surprise in the plot is less than desirable . Hitch overcomes this by taking our agents into the territories of the Central Powers after Young , and here Palmer enters the story ( briefly - it was an early bit part ) . The conclusion is an exciting confrontation on a passenger train and a disaster . And Guilgud and Carroll are together for the romantic conclusion ( not as good a romantic teaming as those of THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS or THE LADY VANISHES ) . Of the major Hitchcock films from 1934 to 1939 , SECRET AGENT is not one of the greatest . Guilgud was far too reserved in his part - good enough to watch but one would hardly think he was ( at that time ) the leading stage star in Britain . Lorre is better because of his eccentricity , and his blending of the sinister and comical ( he is an assassin after all ) . Young , for the first time , played a villain - but nothing like his later performances in THE MORTAL STORM and THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME . Carroll is adequate , but her role opposite Robert Donat a year before was more interesting . A slightly better than average Hitchcock movie , but not a dull film by any stretch of the imagination .


Text2: One of the Ultimate Mobster Movies When Martin Scorsese is at his best , no one can do a gangster movie like him , and "" Goodfellas "" is him at his best . Mind you , I don't think it's his best film ( for me , that title belongs to "" Taxi Driver "" ) , but it's a hugely entertaining and rollicking film that spends its first half making the world of mobsters look like an enticing fantasy and its second half making it look like a living hell . There are fierce performances from everyone , but though Joe Pesci was singled out for his outrageous depiction of the ultimate hot head , the film would not hold together without Ray Liotta's commanding performance at its center . Lorraine Bracco's performance as a naive dense wife who turns into an enraged shrew of a wife is like nails on a chalkboard , but I'm guessing she delivered exactly what was asked of her . The film features rapid fire editing and a soundtrack that won't quit , but in the hands of Scorsese , elements like this feel like more than empty stylistics .

I thought both him and Jamie did a remarkable job in "" Collateral "" . This movie was a lot of fun to watch . Everyone told me that this was the movie to watch if I would rent , so I figured to give it a shot . The whole movie you just keep wondering what would happen next and how it would turn out in the end . It was kind of weird , because you feel like Tom was in some ways right as a hit man , but then you snap back into your senses and "" Wait ! No ! He's killing people ! "" . I'm very serious when I say that he is so in tune with his role . He was very convincing as well as Jamie . Jamie does well as a man who is on the edge of insanity . I felt like if I were in the same situation , I would've reacted the same way too . You eventually just loose it and do your best to keep it together doing things you never expected to do in your life . This was a very terrific movie , and I would highly recommend it for anybody .

To be honest , there was no way I would've had an interest in seeing this movie if were not for my mother , because I mean , John Travolta as a hit man ? For me it didn't work . But my mom insisted that he and the rest of this brilliant cast , Renee Russo , Danny DeVito , and Gene Hackman , were just great and I should give the movie a chance . I was glad I did , the plot worked so well and this movie just kept me on my seat wanting to see the next scene . John plays Chili , a mob hit man , who is on his way to Hollywood just to catch a run away with his boss's money , but he has a better idea . Chili goes to Gene who plays Harry Zim , a B-movie director , and Chili tells him an idea for a movie of the same plot that he came here to do with the run away . Everyone thinks it's a good idea for a movie , including a B-actress Karen Flores , played by Renee , and an Oscar nominee Martin Weir played by Danny . But when Chili takes the run away's money to invest in the movie instead of coming back home with it , the mob families are not so happy and come back for the doe . "" Get Shorty "" is a great movie , especially if you're into the mob films . It adds some great twists and just great comedy that a great cast brought .

CONEY ISLAND was such a successful Fox musical that seven years later it was turned into another starring vehicle for Grable called WABASH AVENUE . It's a breezy turn-of-the-century show biz tale about two Coney Island hucksters and the tricks they play on each other to win patrons at their establishments . Betty is the brassy singer with the garish costumes and exaggerated singing / dancing style that Montgomery has to tone down by tying her to a prop so she can't move but has to deliver her ballad ( "" Cuddle Up A Little Closer "" ) without gyrating all over the stage . Naturally , the love / hate relationship blooms into romance with Grable and Montgomery making a pleasing match as a team . Lost of comedy relief from PHIL SILVERS and CHARLES WINNINGER , some nice song and dance numbers for Grable , and the whole backstage story is easy to take , the usual misunderstandings and schemes backfiring before the fadeout to a happy ending . For BETTY GRABLE's fans , this one has to be rated one of her best .

It's stunning right from the opening scenes , animated with fresh originality and voiced by some expert actors ( HARRY CONNICK , JR . , VAN DIESEL , CLORIS LEACHMAN and the little boy voiced by ELI MARIENTHAL ) . Not only is the story engrossing , but there's a humanization of "" the creature from outer space "" that defies description . The animators manage to make his thought process apparent with minimal dialog and you can really feel for his emotions when he is asked to perform a noble act ( at the climax ) in order to save mankind from a fate worse than death . There's an effective background score by Michael Kamen , without the songs that seem to irritate some devotees of animated films , and it moves briskly at a pleasing pace that should keep young and old riveted to the sometimes magical events . Briskly entertaining and well worth watching - - among the best of the animated films based on pure fantasy . The very expert voice-overs make the characters seem amazingly real .

Filled with haunting images this film was mixed bag for me . To be certain the build up to the siege is very good . There is something about the way the story is told that keeps you watching even though its not the most logical of story lines . The problem for me is that once things really get set in motion there are lapses in logic that distract from often fun proceedings . Granted I was watching this very late at night so there is a chance that I missed something , but I never quite understood why the vampires-if they were so clever to get to Barrow because of the night would have waded into the population with such a blood lust that would have left them with no one to eat two days after they started . There are a few other WTF moments that keep the film from being great , but over all its worth a shot on cable on a Saturday night if nothing else .


Text2: After gutting the source novel the movie turns out to be just another TV movie of the week Who did they make this film for ? The story of a romance between a werewolf and a human , in its prototypical story of mismatched cultures , is the sort of thing thats been done to death in countless films and books . If you're going to do it yet again you have to have some reason . I'm sure that using the source of a well loved , and occasionally banned young adult novel would be the perfect reason to trot out the story line yet again . Unfortunately the film makers have botched the job and we're left with a barely okay little movie . Why use a well known story if you're going to change things around ? great chunks of the book have gone missing . Worse still is the way the film has been shot . It looks more like a TV movie of the week rather than a movie to be seen in the theater , if they were going to make a movie that looks like it belongs on TV why not just release it straight to DVD ? The acting is okay but the characters are all stereotypes of stereotypes . You know whats going to happen simply because it seems to have been written that way . Its not engaging or surprising simply because once a scene starts you can tell how its going to play out , actually once the movie's basic premise is set up you'll know whats going to happen , regrettably you won't care .

Including Tino Martinez , Edgar Martinez , Mark McGwire , Larry Walker , Ken Caminiti , Barry Bonds , A-Rod , Chipper Jones , Paul O'Neil , and so many other greats ! One of the many things I like about the All-Star game is that the viewer gets to see some of the greatest MLB players the sport has to offer that some states in America and even other countries don't get the chance to watch . It always seems that the American League has the upper hand but I for one will never count out the National League . I am a huge Baseball fan and just love everything about the sport !

289,"Text1: Has Its Moments I remember seeing this one Friday night round about 1978-79 when I was twelve years old . In those days we only had three TV channels in Britain and ITV used to show horror films frequently on Friday nights and you could judge how good they were by the way they cropped up in conversation amongst my classmates on the Monday morning . Using this criteria THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD made quite an impact since I can clearly remember someone quoting the line "" My name is Dominick "" and the story featuring Jon Pertwee cropped up . Of course as an adult the Amicus anthology films don't have much of an impact but they were good at the time and I guess this is one of the better efforts Story 1 ) Rather corny but it is somewhat amusing watching Tom Adams camp it up and it does contain the classic quote "" My name is Dominick "" Story 2 ) Despite the presence of Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland the actors do little with their roles because their characters are so sketchilly written . Character development is always a problem in these type of movies but it does contain a twist at the end Story 3 ) Christopher Lee was superb in LORD OF THE RINGS but he's been far from superb in most movies he's appeared in . I guess he deserves some credit for screaming in pain in a fairly convincing manner . The girl playing his daughter is an awful actress however Story 4 ) DOCTOR WHO fans will love this story as we see Jon Pertwee playing an arrogant horror film star . It's also interesting to note his mannerism and costume is the exact same as when he played the Doctor . Trivia fans will no doubt note that he played opposite Ingrid Pitt in the 1972 story The Time Monster , John Bennet in the 1974 story Invasion Of The Dinosaurs and of course starred in WORZEL GUMMIDGE alongside Geoffrey Bayldon who played the crowman An inoffensive and sometimes camp collection of tales but also fairly entertaining even if it's not as good as you remember it from childhood


Text2: Don't Miss This One . The perfect film is not yet with us but this is movie making at its zenith . It's hard to imagine how this film could be improved upon . It's both gripping AND original . Each image on the screen is indelible . I'll give one example . Joseph Cotton waiting for Orson Welles at the gigantic ferris wheel , his coat flapping in the wintry breeze . The scene that follows references all the themes we have been introduced to previously - - crime , friendship , love , betrayal - - and it's very funny too . I mean , five hundred years of democracy and peace producing nothing more than the cuckoo clock . That scene could be played again and again without extinguishing the viewer's interest in it . Not that the movie depends entirely on set pieces . The continuity is provided not just by Holly Martins ' ( Joseph Cotton ) investigative perambulations but by incidents that link with one another or that restate the themes . By restating the theme , I'm referring to things that reveal Holly's failed attempts to replace Harry Lime ( Orson Welles ) in Anna's ( Valli ) life . Holly tries , for instance , to feed her some lines she has to learn for a play . "" Harry used to do that . "" The lines are in German and Holly flubs it until she gives up . And Anna's cat . Holly tries to play with it but it blows him off . "" He only liked Harry . "" The cat next appears in the street below , playing with the shoelaces of Harry , who is hiding in a dark doorway . By "" incidents that link with one another , "" I mean pieces of dialog or action that reflect one another and add to the sense of cohesion . Example : When Anna finds out that Holly is a police informant , she scolds him and says sarcastically , "" Holly - - what a silly name ! "" After the climactic chase , much later , Holly asks Calloway ( Trevor Howard ) to leave him at the gate so he can talk to Anna . Calloway tells him , "" Be sensible , Martins . "" And the reply is : "" Haven't got a sensible name . "" The lines resonate . Another example : twice Calloway and Martins drive past Anna while she is walking down the same road , leaving Harry's funeral - - one at the beginning and again at the very end . It's an adult movie with wit and elisions that are aimed at people who are not seeking black and white cartoon characters . It even manages to make us feel some sympathy for the villainous Harry when he's chased through the sewers . The story has to do with three people : a British officer who will not change his mind about a criminal , a friend of the criminal who does change his mind , and the criminal's lover who does not . Expect an up-beat ending ? Watch Valli walk past Holly Martins on her way out of the cemetery while the leaves fall . In all the films I've seen there are few more moving scenes , and its completely wordless . Everything seems to fit together here - - the direction , the performances , the score , the photography , and the writing . It's nearly a Gesamtkunstwerk and could have been shot in Wagner's Bayreuth instead of Vienna . Anton Karas's musical instrument wasn't chosen at random . It a traditional instrument in Austria and Germany . The word "" zither "" , by the way , is from an old Indo-European root that also gave us "" sitar "" and "" guitar "" . No need to go on about its virtues . If you miss this , you miss a milestone in cinematic history .

Like the later ' Alan Partridge ' , the character originated in a sketch show - in this case , ' Naked Video ' . Wearing a tattered suit ( with string vest ) , clutching a rolled-up newspaper , and a blood-soaked bandage round his head , the drunken philosopher from Govan delivered rants through clenched teeth which he prefaced with : "" I will tell you this , boy ! "" . A lot of what he said made sense though . Gregor Fisher was loathe to take on the role originally as he initially perceived it to be a stereotype , but later changed his mind . Our first sighting of ' Rab ' was a vox pop item in which he described the then-Tory Government as ' jumped-up Fascist bastards ' . He next appeared losing his rag in a D . W . P . office when the clerk refuses to give him benefit . He proved so popular he was eventually given his own show , commencing with the special ' Rab C . Nesbitt's Seasonal Greet ' . What followed was basically a comedy soap opera ; Rab was married to Mary Doll ( Elaine C . Smith ) and had two sons - Gash ( Andrew Fairlie ) and Burney ( Eric Cullen ) . Despite complaints from some English viewers about the incomprehensibility of the cast's accents , it caught on immediately . Ian Pattison's superb scripts combined elements of traditional sitcom with black comedy , such as the episode where Rab thinks he's terminally ill . Gregor Fisher was magnificent as Rab , as was the rest of the cast , particularly Elaine C . Smith as ' Mary Doll ' , Tony Roper as his sex-mad pal ' Jamesie Cotter ' , and his faithless wife ' Ella ' ( Barbara Rafferty ) . Sean Scanlon was impressive in those episodes he did as ' Shug ' . Guest-stars included the great Stanley Baxter , Jimmy Logan , Iain Cuthbertson , Rikki Fulton , and Russell Hunter . A young David Tennent made his television debut here . I must throw in a word of praise for David McNiven's splendid theme tune which caught the mood of the show so well . When Eric Cullen went to prison , ' Burney ' was replaced by cousin ' Screech ' ( David Mackay ) , but it just was not the same ( plans to reinstate the actor collapsed when he unexpectedly died during a minor operation ) . Eventually , Gash married Bridie ( Nicola Park ) and fathered a child . Given the show's immense popularity at the time , it is astonishing how few repeats there have been on B . B . C . - 2 . It is rather like ' The Goodies ' in that respect . You can stick your plastic American rubbish such as ' Friends ' , I'll take Rab every time !

The second broadcast episode of ' The Outer Limits ' is noticeably different from all others ; being more of a political thriller akin to Richard Condon's ' The Manchurian Candidate ' . The only fantasy element is the method used to turn a Chinese agent into Selby's double . Anti-Communist propaganda ? Certainly . But in 1963 the West did feel genuinely threatened by the East , and this episode caught the mood of the time . As Selby , the late Sidney Blackmer is superb , one could easily picture someone like him becoming President . The only false note struck by this chilling episode is the melodramatic finale in which the plot is exposed in the middle of a White House reception . I must mention Dominic Frontiere's eerie music , definitely a major factor in this episode's success .

Text2: A refreshingly original horror movie . In the ' 90's the Scream trilogy meant the revival of the horror genre and teen-horror in particular . After that lots of horror movie were created that all were very much alike and of average ( at best ) quality . "" Final Destination "" however is one fine exception and it distinct itself from other genre movies through its originality . I consider "" Final Destination "" to be one of the most refreshing and original horror movies of this decade . It's not a horror movie with monsters or scary serial killers . It's a movie with an invisible villain ; death itself , which is determined to kill everyone that escaped his clutches . It's a great and original concept that is executed even better as expected . The fact that the ' villain ' is invisible provides the movie with some moments that makes this movie distinct itself from any other movie out of the same genre . Reason why this movie was even better than I anticipated were the deaths in this movie . Every death in the movie is highly complex and wonderfully constructed and executed . You know something bad is going to happen but you never know how and when . Therefor the deaths and way of death all still come as a surprise . It makes the movie very tense and also both scary and gory to watch at times . The movie starts of with a spectacular ( but still obviously ' low ' budget ) plane crash . Fortunately after its beginning the movie doesn't loose any of its pace and the movie mostly remains spectacular to watch throughout its running time , which is only 98 minutes short . All of the actors are obvious B-movie material , which is fine and works out really well for a genre movie like this one . Don't get me wrong , the acting is not bad but none of the actors will win any big award , or star in a blockbuster any time soon . Fine exception , I must admit , perhaps was Seann William Scott who plays a fun role and perhaps shows his very best acting skills yet , in this movie . The movie has some awkward moments and some weak dialog and character treatment at times but thankfully it doesn't really make the movie any less entertaining or good to watch . An highly recommendable , refreshingly original horror flick that surpasses almost every other horror movie of this decade , so far .

294,"Text1: A Bear Tale A Walt Disney HUMPHREY BEAR Cartoon . Humphrey becomes a HOOKED BEAR by stealing as many tasty fish as possible , always trying to keep one step ahead of the Little Ranger . . . This short film has some very funny moments , centered around the personalities of dimwitted Humphrey & fusspot J . Audubon Woodlore - voiced by Jim Macdonald & Bill Thompson respectively . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .


Text2: Blondell & Farrell Are At It Again Two lady process servers will stop at nothing to do their job - but then one falls in love with the man they are stalking . . . WE'RE IN THE MONEY was the sort of ephemeral comic frippery which the studios produced almost effortlessly during the 1930's . Well made & highly enjoyable , Depression audiences couldn't seem to get enough of these popular , funny photo dramas . Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell are perfectly cast as the fearless , fast-talking females who will try anything to serve their subpoenas . Although Joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes , both gals are as talented & watchable as they are gorgeous . Ross Alexander plays Blondell's love interest and he does a very nice job . Remembered now chiefly for his appearance in the classic A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM ( 1935 ) , this talented young man from Brooklyn was gifted with the good looks & acting skills which should have made him a major Hollywood star . Instead , Alexander ended up in mostly forgettable parts in obscure films . Tragically , Ross Alexander died a suicide in 1937 , at the age of only 29 . Hugh Herbert , whimsical & wacky as ever , appears as the girls ' boss . Whether driving a stolen car or piloting a speeding motorboat , he is equally hilarious . Behind him comes a rank of character actors - Henry O'Neill , E . E . Clive , Lionel Stander , Hobart Cavanaugh - all equally adept at wringing every smile out of any situation . Sharp-eyed movie mavens should spot an unbilled Walter Brennan as a witness at the wedding . While never stars of the first rank , Joan Blondell ( 1906-1979 ) & Glenda Farrell ( 1904-1971 ) enlivened scores of films at Warner Bros . throughout the 1930's , especially the eight in which they appeared together . Whether playing gold diggers or working girls , reporters or secretaries , these blonde & brassy ladies were very nearly always a match for whatever leading man was lucky enough to share equal billing alongside them . With a wisecrack or a glance , their characters showed they were ready to take on the world - and any man in it . Never as wickedly brazen as Paramount's Mae West , you always had the feeling that , tough as they were , Blondell & Farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break over the right guy . While many performances from seven decades ago can look campy or contrived today , these two lovely ladies are still spirited & sassy .

But he started out as a character in the Out Of the Inkwell series as a silent character ( actually , he "" spoke "" by word balloons , but the shorts were silent ) with a dog . These cartoons more or less followed a pattern-a live action sequence where either one or both of the Flieschers ( or occasionally some other person ) would bring Koko "" out of the inkwell "" ( i . e . , draw him , usually with a creative entrance ) and the bulk of the cartoon would have Koko and / or Fitz the dog acting and reacting to a specific set of circumstances . Here , Max draws his characters with heated ink , which is obviously not comfortable for them , as they spend the time mainly trying to cool off , with comic results , if little success . Intensely visual ( for obvious reasons ) and often surreal . Fascinating to watch . Well worth tracking down . Recommended .


Text2: Hellboy From director Guillermo del Toro ( Pan's Labyrinth ) , this is another not too bad comic book based hero brought to the screen . The film begins in 1944 , during World War II , and the Nazi Germans are researching the occult , and the villain Grigori Rasputin ( Karel Roden ) has spent 5 years building an huge portal machine which he intends to use to bring out a monstrous God of Chaos . When Rasputin eventually dies from using too much of his power , the machine ( activated ) shoots out a creature of the world intended , a red devil looking creature , and researcher Trevor ' Broom ' Bruttenholm ( John Hurt ) is determined to raise "" Hellboy "" to do good . Sixty years later , Broom is dying of old age , and FBI agent John Myers ( Rupert Evans ) is sent to pretty much help him , and his two legendary friends , obviously Hellboy ( Alien : Resurrection's Ron Perlman ) and aquatic creature Abe Sapien ( Doug Jones ) . They are defending the city , battling crooks through alleys , streets and subways , while trying also to protect friends , including Hellboy's love interest Liz Sherman ( Selma Blair ) , who is learning to control her power of making fire from her body . Eventually , Rasputin returns from his grave , and threatens the city with his many ugly and almost indestructible creatures . Also starring Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning . I can agree the film loses some speed towards the very end , and there are those annoying getting to know each other and stuff like that moments ( sentimentality ) , but it still not a bad film . Worth watching !

SPOILERS Being awakened by his pet cat at three in the morning private eye Philip Marlow , Elliott Gould , drags himself down to the local all-night food-mart to get his kiddie it's favorite cat-food , Curry Brand , only to find out that it's all sold out . Coming back home to his shabby apartment Marlow tries to trick his cat , by putting another can of cat food into a Curry Brand can , but the cat is far to smart to fall for that trick and walks out on him . This was the start of Marlow's troubles in the movie "" The Long Goodbye "" where he's walked out on betrayed and doubled-crossed by almost everyone , man woman and cat , that he comes in contact with . The movie puts 1940's old fashion values of personal ethics loyalty and respect into the 1970's "" Me Generation "" of greed selfishness and nihilism . Marlow is contacted , as he's out looking for his cat , by long-time friend Terry Lennox , Jim Bouton , who needs his help desperately . It seems that Terry had a fight with his old lady Silvia and may have knocked her out cold . Needing a ride across the border into Mexico Marlow without as much as a thought , not knowing what condition Silvia's in , takes him there only to find out later , after Terry was safely out of the country , that she was found brutally murdered . Held in custody for three days Marlow is let out of prison after it was reported by the Mexican authorities that Terry was found dead with a suicide note by his side . Marlow is a bit puzzled in the fact that Terry would murder his wife knowing him all these years Marlow feels that his friend is totally incapable of committing such a brutal and vicious act . Almost as soon as Marlow is back home he gets a call from this Malibu socialite Elleen Wade , Nina Van Pallandt , that her husband big time writer and drinker Roger Wade , Sterling Hyden , is missing . Marlow has no trouble locating the missing Roger Wade who checked himself into a sanatorium to dry out . It turns out that Roger had been doing this kind of thing on and off for years . As Marlow starts connecting the dots he finds out that not only had both Roger & Elleen been neighbors of Terry and his wife Silvia but that Roger had been having an affair with Silvia and may well have been the one who murdered her in a drunken and violent fit . Marlow also gets in trouble with the local mob boss Marty Augustine , Mark Rydell , whom Terry had stolen $355 , 000 . 00 from when he checked out of the country . Augustine feels that Marlow knows where the money is and is determined as hell to get it back even it it kills him , that Marlow not Augustine . To show what a lowlife sicko this Augustine is director Robert Altman has a scene put in the movie where he , just to make a point , slices open his totally innocent and doting girlfriend Jo Ann's , Jo Ann Brody , face with a broken bottle . This despicable act on Augustine part just to show a shocked Marlow , and audience , that he really means business . Marlow , given a few days by Augustine to come up with his stolen cash , travels to Mexico to check on his good friend Larry's death . Having become a bit suspicious about what really happened to Larry after he got a $5 , 000 . 00 bill in the mail from Larry for helping him get away from the dangerous Augustine mob that includes Mr . Muscles himself Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger . Marlow begins to put all the pieces together and realizes that it was not writer Roger Wade who was having an affair with Silvia but the other way around . That Larry in fact was having and affair with Elleen . This revelation came to Marlow after Roger , dead drunk as usual , walked into the Pacific Ocean and drowned himself . It had to be that Roger couldn't live with himself knowing that his wife , not himself as at first Marlow suspected , and Larry were in some way responsible for Silvia's death . Things begin to crystallized for Marlow when Augustine and his boys , Big Arnold included , are about to take him apart that the stolen money , minus the $5 , 000 . 00

The facial expressions and body movements were so overdone as to be hilarious . The one player who had any experience with gun handling was relegated to playing a loser who couldn't even draw his piece without breaking it open and spilling out the rounds . The biggest drawback to this film came when the seriously wounded gunfighter left his sickbed and hobbled off to exchange lead with 3 blood hungry thugs . No way , Jose .

We , as the man who voices to them that he has cameras and microphones everywhere , are onlookers to the moral collapse of this group as liquor , prejudices & strife lead each member to turn on the other .

Although it is apparent that Semon spent a goodly amount of money on this picture - - props , miniatures and explosions were not cheap , even in 1928 - - neither story construction nor character were Semon's strong points and by this point , you needed both to make a good comedy . The story is a simple one : Semon wants to marry the girl , but she doesn't want to marry him . So she tells him she will only marry a "" famous movie star "" . Semon goes to a movie studio , where he is given a job as a stunt man , which he fouls up . He is fired but can't get off the lot without getting caught in a series of bigger and bigger stunts . When it's over , the girl he wants to marry shows up , conveniently enough . "" Will you marry me now ? "" "" No , "" she says and that's the end . The stunts are fouled up in a straightforward way , but without much in the way of verve . The net effect is uninteresting . I should say that they are uninteresting to me . I don't find Semon particularly funny , but he seems to play very well to a large audience , particularly if there are small children in the audience .

Andy Dick is also memorable as is the show's star Ben Stiller who is on the verge of stardom . I love the pilot episode where they spoof the group of U2 and Bono is singing for a cereal and at a Long Island Bar Mitzvah .

"" Divided Into Zero "" is a cold and deeply disturbing horror short which features plenty of unsettling violence with lashings of paedophilia on display .

This is the strongest of the Captain & the Kids Series from MGM that I have seen , and the result can be laid squarely at the feet of its director - - or ' supervisor ' as he is titled here , William Hanna . Within a couple of years he and Joseph Barbera would team up to invent Tom and Jerry and you can see what would happen here : bone-breaking slapstick comedy squarely within the bounds of character , here the Captain's mad temper and Billy Bletcher's on-the-spot voice work . But the other characters are also spot on , the Kids - - who make a brief appearance , contemptuously eating pancakes off the Captains head ; Mama , losing her temper and stalking out ; the voiceless Inspector , silent , cowardly and zany ; and a malevolent vacuum cleaner . This was not an enjoyable series for anyone to work on . It drove Friz Freleng back to the arms of MGM , but you can see it is just Hanna's meat .

303,"Text1: Holiday Short Subject This hard-to-find little film was MGM's Christmas Short Subject for 1931 and it's a lot of fun for old movie buffs . The plot ( Jackie Cooper wants to give a Christmas dinner to his neighborhood pals and his friends at the studio lend a hand ) is a mere contrivance to show as many of MGM's top talent as possible in 9 minutes . Norma Shearer - as Thalberg's wife she was Queen of the Lot - gets the most screen time . The enjoyment is in trying to put the correct moniker to all the others as they appear - most for only a few seconds . In order of their appearance , here is a complete listing of the uncredited celebrities : Jackie Cooper , Norma Shearer , Jimmy Durante ( dressed as Santa ) , Marie Dressler , Wallace Beery , Polly Moran , Reginald Denny , Clark Gable , Charlotte Greenwood , Lionel Barrymore , Leila Hyams , Cliff Edwards , Ramon Novarro , Marion Davies , and Anita Page . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .


Text2: extremely entertaining , even by today's standards suspenseful , and probably Hitchcock's first great ( sound ) movie The 39 Steps , which is based on a novel and now has become the basis of a hit Broadway show , is full of the kinds of things we love about Alfred Hitchcock's films , and in a rough , awesome form . It's got a MacGuffin , sort of ( or rather the title itself is something that doesn't even matter ultimately in what it really means ) , it's got a "" wrong man "" scenario where the lead character is chased as a suspect with spies and daring-do escapes , and the interaction between a classy leading man ( here Robert Donat ) and a leading lady ( here , though for a shorter time , Madeline Carroll ) up to par with him as a screen presence . True , it's also a little less ' polished ' , if you will , compared to Hitchcock's 50s and 60s work , but considering how so few years it came out after the advent of sound , many sequences are rather incredible , if only for what little is used . I loved seeing the chases , one on a train , another through a mountain-side , and another that is more like a "" hide-don't-find "" moment after Richard and ( very reluctant ) Pamela escape from the spies and hide under a bridge covered with sheep . Even the climax of the picture speaks to Hitchcock's unequivocal gifts at painting suspense but also throwing in a sliver of pathos ; watch "" Mr . Memory "" in the final shot explaining about a formula or other and see how Hitchcock regards such silly things as "" plot details "" , unless it's at the expense of something of a joke ( i . e . on the train with the Hard Day's Night ' old man ' and the other guy joking about the paper ) . What matters is that the story keeps moving and , under the circumstances , makes some sense . And here we get somewhat a pre-North-by-Northwest tale where average Joe , Richard , brings to his home Miss Annabella Smith , who's a spy and is running after shooting someone at the Memory show they both just left from . Morning after , he finds she's dead with a knife in her back , he's the blame , and has to run to find people she's mentioned to him ( which Hitchcock shoots eerily in a faded close-up over a map of her face repeating things she said earlier in a different tone of voice ) . Throughout this short but invigorating film , we get lots of comedic bits , like Richard's stumble into a town hall meeting and giving a speech to buy some time . Or even a lovely romantic piece that's like a slice of a silent film as Pamela almost escapes but decides to curl up on the couch instead . It's overall a beautiful , tense but very funny movie by a filmmaker who knows his stuff inside and out , and isn't worried about showing a good time in the midst of some unconventional technical choices .

The villain in the film a clean shaven cave boy , John Caso , does kill more then half the cast in the movie by the time its over but at the same time you can't hold it against him for what he does . The cave boy we later find out was abandoned by his father and never had a normal childhood . This instilled a deep resentment in the boy for the human race whom he held , together with his dad , responsible for the predicament that he finds himself in : Living in a cave and living off the scraps of tourists who vacation in the valley . All this killing and destruction would not have happened if it wasn't for real-estate tycoon Allen Sangster , Cameron Mitchell , deciding to build a campground in the valley that the cave boy dwelled in . With dozens of campers in the area the cave boy just went wild , in his hatred for civilized man , going on a rampage killing some dozen of them by the time the movie was over . We have to understand the cave boys frame of mind in what he did . Feeling that the campers represented his father the cave boy took it out on them for what his dad did to him by leaving him out in the woods to fend for himself at an early age . Besides the interesting and deep psychological aspects , father and son relationship , of the film the rest of the movie was just too hard to take seriously even if you tried . The cave boy not only survived in the wild for some 17 years he also somehow learned how to drive heavy earth moving equipment , like bulldozers , and how to start fires . Not by rubbing two rocks or sticks together but by releasing gas from a gas-tank and then having the unsuspecting victim light a match blowing himself , and anyone within 50 feet of him , to pieces . The cave boy at first has the local park ranger George Webster , John Kerry , feel that it's a killer bear that's doing all the killing in and around the "" Memorial Valley "" campground .

Text2: Sleep it off SPOILER ALERT This group of cultists have been kidnapping young girls in and around London and , after giving them a blood transfusion , tattooing them . It turns out that little Heather , Sophie Stuckey , somehow escaped her captors but has since become unable to speak . Heather ended up spending all her time in a London Police safe-house staring aimlessly at the TV . It's when London lady cop Janet Losley , Shirley Henderson , was being treated to stop her from smoking that she , in her subconscious , revealed to her hypnotist Michael Strother , Gran Visnjic , about the comatose Heather which he , in explaining her smoking habits , innocently revealed to her . Knowing that Michael is on to something , in that there was no way he could have known about Heather , Janet literally blackmails him into helping her . Janet tries to get Michael to help her in not only getting into Heather's mind but in finding out who's behind her kidnapping and the murder of three girls who weren't as lucky as she was . As we soon find out Michael is in self imposed exile in London from the US after he "" cured "" one of his patients back in Seattle Washington . The man that Michael "" cured "" was so deathly afraid of water that he wasn't even willing to take a bath or shower in it ! After being "" cured "" by Michael he then jumped into a lake that was , in the early spring thaw , too cold to take a dip in . This had the poor guy lose consciousness , from a severe case of hypothermia , and drown ! With him now being forced to solve the so-called "" Tattoo Murders "" Michael now feels he can redeem himself not knowing that he's about to become the killer's latest victim . Extremely muddled story about this cult leader Francis Paladine , John Rogan , who's over 500 years old and uses the lifeblood of his victims , like Dracula , to keep himself alive forever . Michael puts his life on the line to get to the bottom of the "" Tattoo Murders "" only to end up on a slab with his blood being drained out by the mad Francis Paladine himself . It's only little Heather , after snapping out of her coma , that comes to Michael's rescue . SPOILER ALERT With all the bad guys put on ice in the city morgue for good we , and Michael , get the shock of our lives in the final moments of the movie which we all thought was going to be a happy ending . Were shocked to see this strange and bizarre finger pointing routine we saw earlier in the film by the real cult leader who , judging from the persons age and medical condition , didn't seem to have much long to go in this world . As it turned out the cult leaders "" Lifeforce "" was transfered on to someone else in order to keep the evil alive and active in its next incarnation . That someone else turns out to be someone that's very near and dear to both Michael & Janet hearts !

307,"Text1: "" That is my one permanent characteristic . "" My only prior experience with Peter Lorre's work was in two of my favorite Humphrey Bogart films , as Joel Cairo in "" The Maltese Falcon "" , and as the scheming Ugarte in "" Casablanca "" . Both characterizations were excellent and memorable efforts . His casting as a Japanese "" International Police "" investigator is almost as offbeat as Boris Karloff's portrayal of Mr . Wong in that series of mystery films of the same era . Lorre actually portrays two characters , besides Moto he operates undercover as antiques shop keeper Kuroki . From that vantage point , he tries to keep tabs on a band of international saboteurs who intend to blow up the French fleet as it enters the Suez Canal . The group is led by "" Fabian the Great "" ( Ricardo Cortez ) , who plays in theater shows as a ventriloquist , and includes Eric Norvel ( George Sanders ) , and Danforth ( John Carradine ) . Danforth is actually a British Agent attempting to hook up with Moto , and his knowledge of Fabian's plans is intentionally less than complete . Pay attention to the scene when Fabian first suspects that Danforth is not what he seems . He uses a pen to scribble a beard on a photo of British Intelligence Agent Richard Burke in a notebook dossier . The beard he draws ends in a straight line under Burke's chin . In a later scene , when Fabian shows the photo to Norvel , the beard is thicker and descends with a point toward Burke's collar . The actual beard Carradine wears in his role looks quite humorously phony , and makes one thankful for present day film makeup . The mystery here is rather straightforward , no murders to solve and no red herrings as in the Charlie Chan franchise . We know who the bad guys are right from the start , and the only revelation needed is how Moto will save the day . This he does by escaping from an underwater death trap and by prematurely detonating the mines intended for the French ships , thereby providing them with enough warning to turn around . As a murderous saboteur , Fabian proves rather inept , as he fails to properly dispatch Moto , and earlier his girlfriend Connie ( Virginia Field ) who discovers his plot . Too bad , as Connie does the honors of stopping Fabian during his tussle with Moto . Peter Lorre doesn't look like a very physical guy , small in stature and kind of mousy , so his first on screen jiu jitsu throw caught me off guard . I'd be curious to know if he did his own stunt work and martial moves depicted in the movie , as almost all were done in darkly shaded scenes . As a Charlie Chan fan , I was curious about the Sultana Theater playbill advertising "" Charlie Chan in Honolulu "" as one of it's attractions . That movie , released the prior year in 1938 , featured Sidney Toler in his first portrayal of the Chinese detective . However the playbill mistakenly states that Chan is played by Warner Oland . It seems to me that the movie should have gotten this right , as 1938's "" Mr . Moto's Gamble "" was originally begun as "" Charlie Chan at Ringside "" with Oland . However Oland's illness and subsequent death required it's rewriting as a Moto film . This movie , released a year later , came after Oland's death in 1938 . "" Mr . Moto's Last Warning "" was at least interesting enough to recommend looking up other titles in the series . I'll be looking forward to more adventures of the Japanese agent Kentaro Moto .


Text2: "" What we want is more humane killers . "" I'm sure I missed a lot of the nuance of this film because of the language barrier - it was in English , without subtitles . I picked it up in a dollar bargain bin almost a year ago because John Lennon's picture was on the video sleeve . Though others on this board state that he stole the show , I came away with the impression that his supporting role was more in the way of capitalizing on his Beatles celebrity . Yet his death scene turns out to be unusually prophetic and surreal , and one of the ironic twists of the story . I don't know anything about the other principals involved in the movie , including director Richard Lester . However there's no denying that the absurdity of war theme comes through in virtually every scene . I would liked to have been ' in ' on more of the Brit humor involved , and perhaps a second viewing might help fill in some of the blanks . I'd like to thank poster ' Phlicker ' for explaining the symbolism of the pastel soldiers who kept popping up , even though it should have been readily apparent . I guess even the British visuals are difficult to understand . You know what really blew me away though ? Doing the math on the film's release , it's forty years old this year ! FORTY YEARS ! For me , that might be the most surreal aspect of the picture , having grown up as a teenager with the Beatles and John Lennon . Just as surreal is the fact that Lennon was shot to death almost twenty seven years ago as I write this . The insanity and absurdity of war and death continues every day , and humanity learns nothing from it .

MY GIRL TISA gave American audiences their first real glimpse of the charms of LILLI PALMER who had been making waves in Great Britain in a number of films for a decade previously . Here she has the starring role as a Hungarian immigrant dealing with the plight of survival in New York's lower East side , swarming with tenement apartments , sweatshops and all the rascals needed to keep the plot spinning . SAM WANAMAKER was a pleasant choice for a co-star and Warner surrounded them with a nice supporting cast headed by AKIM TAMIROFF ( studying hard for his naturalization test ) , HUGO HAAS , STELLA ADLER and ALAN HALE and gave the production some nice pictorial touches with regard to costumes and music for the early 20th century flavor . But the story is a slight one , never amounting to much , although it does deal with the immigration of European immigrants in a detailed way not usually explored in films from this era . Summing up : Passes the time pleasantly and provides a star-making role for LILLI PALMER .


Text2: Brando at his most eccentric in odd western from Arthur Penn . . . Never thought I would see the day when JACK NICHOLSON was upstaged by another actor , but that's what we get in THE MISSOURI BREAKS , an odd western directed by Arthur Penn that teamed the two icons for the first and only time . If you like your westerns in a more conventional mode , you can forget this one . It comes just about at the breaking point in Brando's career where he was more often seen in cameo roles than leading man parts , and the film itself was savaged by the critics . Actually , it's standard western material with good vs . evil but everything is twisted for the sake of eccentricities of either the script or the actors themselves . Definitely not the sort of western John Ford would direct , nor does the John Williams score accommodate it the way Ennio Morricone's music would for the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns . "" A gunfighter protects the herd from a rustler "" is the simple outline on which the film is built . After a young horse rustler is hanged , the story opens with the gang informing JACK NICHOLSON about the incident and the gang plots on how to go about keeping their activities away from the law . Unfortunately , the mulling over what to do is written in an extensively tiresome scene with dull dialog and clich√©d remarks , just a hint of things to come . Brando makes his eccentric entrance into the story about thirty-five minutes into the film as bounty hunter Robert E . Clayton , Jr . and the film goes downhill from then on , with Brando hired to make sure that Jack Nicholson and gang get their comeuppance . Meanwhile , a bunch of sub-plots involving Nicholson's attempt at romance , are slowly depicted and never fully developed . A young RANDY QUAID is one of Nicholson's gang members . Photography varies from brightly lit exteriors to muddy looking color for all the interiors of darkly lit cabins . A very lean score by John Williams fails to make any particular impression . Summing up : Brando addicts will no doubt think this is one of his greatest performances . Maybe not , but it is one of his strangest . Nicholson in a lower key is the major surprise .

Text2: Shown completely on YOU TUBE . Aside from a curious double edged piece of racism , this "" Silly Symphony "" Cartoon is pegged on the film stars of the 1930s . I suspect more people than we can think of actually can remember most of these stars . They include , Katherine Hepburn ( as "" Little Bo Peep "" - rallee she is ) ; Charles Laughton , Spencer Tracy , and Freddie Bartholemew as the Three Men in a boat ( Laughton is Captain Bligh , Tracy is Manuel from CAPTAIN'S COURAGEOUS , and Freddie is David Copperfield ) ; Hugh Herbert as Old King Cole , Ned Sparks as his "" merry "" Jester , Groucho , Chico , and Harpo Marx as his fiddler three , Joe ( UGH ! ! ) Penner as the servant bringing him a bowl ( actually a kettle ) and asking if he wants a "" Duck "" ( Donald Duck ) ; Stan Laurel as Simple Simon and Oliver Hardy as the pie-man ; Eddie Cantor as Little Jack Horner , and his four and twenty blackbirds include Cab Calloway , Fats Waller , and Lincoln Perry ( Stepin ' Fetchit ) ; Wallace Beery as Little Boy Blue ; Greta Garbo as Marjorie Daw , taught a lesson by Edward G . Robinson ; and at the conclusion they have Fred Astaire ( unfortunately dancing alone ) , Zazu Pitts , Edna Mae Oliver and Mae West playing horns ( Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel and the Marx Brothers also return playing instruments , and we see George Arliss playing a saxophone and Clark Gable on another instrument ) , and Martha Raye and Joe E . Brown dancing and kissing . Most of these figures are still pretty easy to remember ( Penner and Arliss I think are the most obscure - the former quite understandably ) . The reason is the films of most of these people ( or the recordings of Calloway and Waller ) are accessible by DVD or video . The interesting thing is how the Disney people were watching the movies of the day or the culture . As pointed out in another review of this cartoon only three Marx Brothers pop up - Zeppo had left the act in 1933 . W . C . Fields is Humpty Dumpty , and he is pestered by Charlie McCarthy ( this was the same year as their film together , YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HONEST MAN ) . When they do the three men in a tub , Laughton is Bligh , Tracy is Manuel , and Bartholemew is young David Copperfield ( oddly enough , not Harvey Cheyne - the role he played opposite Tracy's Manuel in CAPTAIN'S COURAGEOUS ) . Garbo had said "" I want to be alone "" in GRAND HOTEL in 1933 , but the line was still her best known one - it would be spoofed by Sig Ruman in NINOTCHKA , opposite Garbo . The Laurel and Hardy jokes show careful study of how Stan always does something that Ollie can't and when Ollie figures he can do it he comes a cropper . But Ollie later changes the range of Stan's clarinet playing from tenor to base by hitting Stan on the head with a mallet . That is similar to a joke done by Ollie to a singing Stan in WAY OUT WEST in 1937 . Oddly enough Raye and Brown would be in a comedy together ( ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A TOUCHDOWN ) in 1939 , so possibly rumors about such a teaming were in the air . Somebody was doing his homework here . The racist jokes dealing with the four and twenty "" blackbirds "" is as I said a two - edged sword . On the one hand the caricatures are definitely racist , in particular Perry . But the fact that all three were included strikes me as showing they are considered celebrities . Why have them otherwise if they weren't be recognized by the audience watching the cartoon ( the Fleischer cartoons at Paramount frequently used Cab Callaway too ) . The only inexcusable racist joke ( aside from exaggerating Perry's shtick ) was that a blackberry pie hits Hepburn in the face , turning her into an African-American "" Bo - Peep "" for a moment , and she starts talking with a southern drawl . Hepburn knew of the cartoon - she mentioned it on a program she did in the 1990s about her life for PBS , and said the cartoon's sequence of her "" Bo - Peep "" riding an outboard motor passed the three men in the tub , was the first","{""output"": ""NO""}"
310,"Text1: "" I concede nothing , until they throw dirt in my face . "" Though limited by the technology and writing of the era , "" 13 Rue Madeleine "" stands as an effective and exciting espionage thriller . I couldn't help thinking that if made today , it might prove worthy as a contender for a number of major film awards . James Cagney is top billed as a successful espionage agent , now training recruits for Secret Intelligence . His newest class , Operation 77 , contains a German agent . However rather than simply exposing the agent , the mission intriguingly evolves to planting false information regarding a second front in Europe to misdirect the Nazis and gain time for the Allies in preparation for D-Day . An associated goal of locating a scientist in the employ of Vichy France would also help uncover the location of German warheads aimed at England . A major part of the story revolves around the Nazi double agent Kuncel ( Richard Conte ) masquerading as a recruit for Sharkey's ( Cagney ) outfit . When he unwittingly ( and unknowingly ) outs himself in a set up that exposes his experience , Sharkey and his superiors go to work planting misinformation regarding Plan B - the invasion of Germany through the Dutch lowlands . At the same time , they make their one mistake , allowing agent Lassiter ( Frank Latimore ) to know the real identity of his buddy O'Connell . While on a mission , Lassiter's demeanor changes enough to give himself away , and O'Connell / Kuncel has no trouble doing what Lassiter might have - he kills him by severing his parachute jump line . Once the film gets under way following the training sequences , the film builds with tension and mystery . Lending support to the main story are Annabella as part of the Sharkey O-77 team , and Sam Jaffe as French Mayor Gallimard . A rare highlight of the film has Annabella's character suffering a violent death when discovered by the Nazis , not the norm for a female lead . For film buffs , it's a hoot to catch uncredited performances by future stars like Karl Malden , E . G . Marshall and Red Buttons . The picture's title comes from the address of Gestapo Headquarters in Paris , and trivia fans might be interested in something I picked up after watching this quite a while ago for the first time . Shortly after , I caught the Charlie Chan film "" The Trap "" from 1946 . In that story , the killer uncovered by Chan once maintained a Paris address that happened to be right across the street - at 14 Rue Madeleine !


Text2: "" You'll be fightin ' the devil on his own ground here , Sir . "" Boy oh boy , if this film didn't star Willie Nelson I hazard to think what the reviews might be like . This is one mess of a story , defying logic and credibility even in the days of the Wild West . The wedding scene at the start of the film is where it all begins , I initially thought Willie was the father giving his daughter away . That he was marrying a character portrayed by Morgan Fairchild might have been an interesting hook , but as it quickly turns out , the marriage is doomed from the start . But not in any way you might expect . There's the usual predictable opposition on hand to give Preacher Shay ( Nelson ) a hard go of it , and Sheriff Reese Scoby ( R . G . Armstrong ) isn't much help at first . There's no single event that triggers the sheriff to righteous action , he just suddenly sees it his duty to help the new Preacher oppose town boss Larn Claver ( Royal Dano ) and his clan . That opposition takes focus in the windmill project that promises to relieve the town's reliance on Claver's control of the only available water supply . Through it all , Raysha Shay ( Fairchild ) grows increasingly disillusioned with frontier life , and longs to return home to Philadelphia . Only a quick furtive glance at the opening wedding scene gives a hint of what's to come . When a former suitor takes Raysha away from Montana , Nelson's character transforms from a man of God to a man of the devil . Tracking down the lovers to a saloon in another town , the good Reverend simply guns them down . Two shots and it's all over , and no one arrives on the scene to see what all the fuss is about . The Preacher draws a bye and gets away with murder . Sheriff Scoby , who's been run out of his own town for failing to keep the Claver's at bay , tracks Shay to a secluded farm where he's taken in by a woman who sent her shiftless husband packing a couple years earlier . Katherine Ross should have known better , but hey , it's what the part called for . How this all translates into anything remotely believable is beyond me . Sheriff Scoby shoots Shay at point blank range but doesn't kill him , he goes into an alcoholic depression , Shay recovers to shake Scoby out of his stupor , and the pair heads back to Driscoll to square things with the Claver's . I'll have to assume that one's takeaway from all this should be that Preacher Shay is a tortured hero whose singular brand of justice is fitting retribution in a lawless wilderness . Instead , all I got was that Shay got away with murder more than once , backed by a pretty decent soundtrack . I guess if you're a Willie Nelson fan , the story is forgivable given the "" Red Headed Stranger's "" real life reputation and charisma . But if you expect anything remotely plausible coming out of this flick , you'll be left with blue eyes crying in the rain .

Not saying Kevin Costner was a bad choice , just that he was probably not the best choice for the role of Robin Hood . I also did not think Christian Slater was the best choice for his role either . Neither did a bad job , just not the best casting in the world . However , Alan Rickman was an absolutely perfect choice for the Sheriff of Nottingham . He was such a likable villain that I was almost pulling for him in the end . Morgan Freeman is also a very good member of this cast . His character adds some good humor as he is out of his native country for the first time . So the story goes like this , Robin Hood is fighting in the crusades and is captured . He escapes with a man back to his native England , only to find that in the king's absence certain individuals are taking advantage of this by having higher than normal taxes and stealing others of their powers by accusing them of crimes . So after a period of adjustment and a meeting with petty thieves in the woods Robin goes on the offensive by doing what Robin Hood always does , stealing from the rich and giving to the poor .

So much better that they just refuse to go back to their maker , and heaven , after they ended up dying in a tragic plane crash . The three old guys Irish Michael O'Brien , Charles Winninger , British Allan "" Chad "" Chadwick , A . Aubrey Smith , and American businessman George Melton , Harry Carey , end up bonding with their unexpected Christmas guests Texas cowboy James Huston , Richard Carlson , and children clinic volunteer Jean Lawrence , Jean Parker , who end up becoming their lifelong , and even beyond life , friends . Becoming almost inseparable both James and Jean drift apart when their three old benefactors , with Michael leaving James a cache of money to continue his fledging singing career , unexpectedly perish in a plane crash . Being stung by success , as the new American Idol , James gets hooked up with Broadway singing sensation Arlene Terry , Helen Vinson , who's just nuts about the handsome but shy Texas cowboy . This has Michael , who's stuck in the world between life and death , try to somehow show the love sick James what a mistake he made in tossing his one and only true love , on earth and beyond , Jean away for the manipulated and scheming Arlene . Both Chad and George also hang out in what seems to be the Astral World , an existence between life and death , for a short time until they finally get their bearings straight and ascend to heaver . Chad ends up going to heaven with his dead son David , William Bakewell , who was killed in the Great War or WWI . The cranky and penny pinching George finally found out , after his death , that money isn't everything if your in a place , the world in between life and death , where its not worth the paper that it's printed on and also sees the light , heaven , by the time the film is over . Only Michael gets involved with the world of the living in his attempt to save James from a fate worse then death in both losing Jean as well as his life by getting himself involved with Arlene . James in fact does see the light after he's shot and killed by Arlene's drunk and jealous ex-husband-Mr . Terry I presume-and is given a second chance to return back to earth , and life , to reunite with the girl that he left behind Jean . Nothing really new here even though the movie predates the far more popular and very similar Frank Capra Christmas Classic "" It's a Wonderful Life "" by some six years . The film "" Beyond Tomorrow "" nevertheless still packs quite a wallop in movies about life after death and what it's , our very meager existence , really all about in the grand scheme of things . There's also in the film the two Czarist Russian survivors of the Commnist Revolution Madame Tanya , Maria Ouspenskay , who's the only one in the movie who can see or sense the three dead plane crash victims and her stuffy and stoned faced butler Josef , Alex Melesh . It's Josef who at times when his face was frozen stiff looked like the newest member , even though he never was a US President , of Mount Rushmore .

316,"Text1: Watch it for what it is , rather than what others expect it to be . . . It seems to be "" trendy "" to have bad things to say about this work , but I found it largely captivating . As the first ( or rather , the fourth , but we won't go into that ) installment of the Star Wars saga , this was meant not as a climactic piece of cinematic art , but more as an introduction to the series . This chapter of the Star Wars space opera had no "" real "" climactic center , no true "" ending . "" This is why the studios chose chapter 4 , the central climactic center of the story , to finance first . Of course , Lucas financed the rest , and 20th Century / Fox lost all rights to their share of the Lucas / Star Wars money machine when they lost their studio head , years ago . It was only due to Lucas's "" generosity "" that they still retain distribution rights . This work was an opening chapter only and had it been the first to have been made , the audiences would have been left to say , "" WTF ? ! was that ? "" So chapter 4 was rewritten to contain a definite beginning , climactic center , and ending so that it more resembled a "" stand alone "" feature . You know . . . just in case . But Lucas knew what he was doing , and Star Wars 1 ( as it was known then ) quickly became Star Wars : Episode 4 - A New Hope , and the progenitor of the Star Wars run . The action most critics seem to have missed , is covert . Duplicitious characters surreptitiously bargain behind closed doors , thereby setting up the story and the beautifully rich darkling sub-plots . And there IS actual action enough to keep even the die-hards entertained . But suspense , rather than action , is the element which fuels this fire . Action comes from the climactic build up , and is prevalent in Episodes 4-6 because they were the climax of the series . So don't be too disappointed if there is more story to these prequel installments , than action . The story is designed to bring about the action in the later episodes . Another issue with this work is the CGI . Fans are so accustomed to hearing the purists complain about the CGI from the Original Trilogy , that they've forgotten why there's an issue . That having been said , the CGI in this installment ultimately makes the final product as adventurous , exciting , and cohesive in story as it was . Lucas's Star Wars Universe is beautifully conceived , and wondrously executed as to be a treasure which is the fourth highest grossing film ever . Apparently , someone liked it . His characters are beautifully conceived and executed , and competently paint the world of Lucas in such a way as to endear , not repulse . All characters but one : Jar Jar Binks . He is more annoying than the Ewoks , and not half as amusing . He seems to be lacking cultural identity , but if you listen closely , his language and pronunciation closely resembles Mush Mouth from the Fat Albert show . He also , at times , sounds Jamaican . But it's on again , off again . I think this installment could have done well without him . Yes , he serves a purpose ; that of comic relief . You can't help but laugh at his ineptitude , regardless of how you feel about his presence . Yes , he is key to the plot elements , but Lucas could have created a much better , more PC little guy than this Ebonics-speaking , long-eared , spotty-lipped , blunderbuss . Much has been said concerning "" stiff "" performances . I can't help but laugh at that . Liam Neeson was characterized as a high-level Jedi , and he portrayed his part , as such , with dignity and sense of propriety . He was perfect as Qui-Gon Jinn and his bearing commanded respect . That was not stiff acting . That was an extraordinarily competent show of character acting . If that means he comes off as "" stiff , "" so be it .

317,"Text1: Loneliness and the power of forgiveness Montgomery Clift is a writer hired to be "" Miss Lonelyhearts "" for a newspaper in "" Lonelyhearts , "" a 1958 film also starring Robert Ryan , Myrna Loy , Delores Hart , and Maureen Stapleton in her film debut . About 30 years ago - yes , 30 - I saw the play "" Miss Lonelyhearts "" with none other than Kelsey Grammar , who had not yet gone to Hollywood . The play , as well as the book , are quite different from what ended up on the screen . In the film , the ending was changed to a more upbeat one . This is a great film if you're contemplating suicide because this will take you right over the edge . It is relentlessly depressing with some pathetic characters and some unlikeable ones . Adam ( Clift ) is a man with a hidden past that he keeps even from his girlfriend ( Delores Hart ) . All the viewer really knows at first is that he was raised in an orphanage and has a father in prison . The paper on which Adam works is owned by William Shrike , an abusive , cynical man ( Ryan ) who is horrible not only to his employees but to his wife ( Myrna Loy ) because of her infidelity 10 years before . This is a man who carries a grudge . When he meets Adam , he thinks his sincerity is fake and becomes determined to wear him down . His first step is to hire him as Miss Lonelyhearts . Adam becomes very bothered by the problems his readers send to him , especially because he can't help anyone . When Shrike dares him to meet one of the letter-writers , he does so . It's Maureen Stapleton , a needy woman with a crippled husband who can't make love to her . The performances in this film are very good , but the film isn't . Clift apparently was very disappointed in it because it lacked none of the bite of the novel and none of the symbolism of Adam as a Christlike figure bearing the sins of others . Robert Ryan is very convincing as the hateful Shrike , and Myrna Loy is beautiful and sad as his wife . Stapleton received an Oscar nomination for her effective performance . An accomplished stage actress , Stapleton evokes the desperation of this lonely woman . Montgomery Clift by this time was almost at a point where he was dependent upon the kindness of strangers . He was too much of a risk for Hollywood to be interested . Like so many people who are victims of horrible accidents , he had become addicted to painkillers and alcohol . If not for Elizabeth Taylor making a case for him , he would not have been cast in "" Suddenly , Last Summer . "" As it was , Mankiewicz almost stopped shooting on the film . He is fragile and glassy-eyed here , in obvious pain , and his voice slurs . The fragility works well in this role as does the sensitivity he brings to the part . He still had a beautiful smile , which unfortunately he doesn't get to use much here . It's always wonderful to see Montgomery Clift perform , even toward the end of his career . That interesting voice of his , the intelligence and sensitivity of his work , and the tenderness with which he approached a love scene were unmatched . His film career was relatively short , but he left a powerful legacy . "" Lonelyhearts "" is not a great film , but it stars Montgomery Clift , so it's worth seeing .

Text2: High , High Up In The Sky A Walt Disney GOOFY Cartoon . The most dangerous place in the air may well be GOOFY'S GLIDER . There are plenty of chuckles in this the first of the Sports Goofy cartoons . Some pertinent information about gliders is actually given in between the Goof's attempts to get airborne . John McLeish narrates in his best documentarian manner . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a storm of naysayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

I think that's where the problem lies - The gags aren't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age . Did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot ?

In one of Harrison Ford's real low points , he plays a gruff pilot who gets stranded on an uncharted island with stuffy reporter Anne Heche . While Lina Wertmuller's "" Swept Away "" did a really good job with this sort of situation ( and "" Gilligan's Island "" made it really funny ) , "" Six Days Seven Nights "" totally bungles it . It's got to be one of the most predictable movies ever . Overall , the movie brings up two questions : why can't Harrison Ford just stick with what he's good at , and why was Anne Heche getting so many roles in the late ' 90s ? I assume that Ford probably wants to downplay his role in this movie ( although his recent roles haven't been much better : "" K-19 "" , "" Hollywood Homicide "" and "" Firewall "" ) . Ditto Heche . Also starring - and embarrassing themselves - are David Schwimmer , Allison Janney , Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo . And above all , it showed that director Ivan Reitman was truly declining , to the point that he most recently backed Arnold Schwarzenegger for California governor . All in all , avoid this one .

However , if you are a huge Python fan , the only Pythoner whose part was worth a nickel was the title character , so ably played by Graham Chapman - - he was terrific . John Cleese was fine but was only in the movie for a cameo and Eric Idle was never less funny ( except in 102 Dalmatians - - - YUCK ! ) . As for the non-Pythoners , some were exceptional ( Madeline Kahn , the Doctor and a few others ) and some were so annoying I wanted to kill them ( particularly the unfunny Cheech and Chong - - who ruined the last 20 minutes of the film ) . How could the movie , with so many wonderful moments , also go flat so often ? Whatever the reasons ( other than Cheech and Chong ) , the movie just failed to deliver and I feel it was a mostly forgettable experience - - with some great moments sprinkled in here and there .

I'm really surprised this film got a PG - - there's so much flesh shown on these girls ! It goes VERY close to an R more than once . Also the jokes are very stupid - - one of them has Liu being a lousy cook ! I thought that stereotype disappeared in the ' 50s ! As for the acting - - Lynch is very good in her role ; Bill Murray looks miserable ; Barrymore looks confused ; Liu can't act ; Matt LeBlanc ( as Liu's boyfriend ) is basically playing Joey from "" Friends "" and Tom Green is REALLY annoying as Barrymore's boyfriend . Only Cameron Diaz gives out a good performance - - she's so lively and fun . Also Luke Wilson is very good as her boyfriend . Those two have great chemistry together . So , I gave the film a 4 only for Diaz , Wilson and some good fight scenes . Otherwise , this is a mess .

In two wonderful segments , Chan's chauffeur Birmingham Brown ( Mantan Moreland ) carries on a spirited dialog with Ben Carter , each interpreting the other and finishing each other's sentences , leaving Number # 3 Son Tommy ( Benson Fong ) totally confused . There's an interesting segue near the middle of the film when Charlie Chan meets a former Shakespearean actor , now radio personality named Horace Karlos ; could this be a tribute to Boris Karloff ? By the time the film ends , there are four victims , all having been been murdered for being too close to the identity of the criminal attempting to steal government radar plans . In a clever scheme , two of the victims are dispatched via the pitch of a radio broadcast that shatters a vial containing a gas that lethally interacts with nicotine when the victims puff on a cigarette .

This film is a musical hardcore porn version of Lewis Carroll's classic story ' Alice in Wonderland ' , and so as you can probably imagine , it's a little bit strange ! That being said , Carroll's Wonderland is ripe for fusing with a ' sexual awakening ' plot line , and really I'm surprised it took until 1976 for someone to make a film like this ! Bud Townsend's film was obviously shot on a very low budget and the film has to rely on it's numerous distractions in order to stay interesting ; and these range from the silly costumes , even sillier songs , and of course ; a few hardcore sex scenes . The film is not too far removed from the original story really and naturally we focus a young girl named Alice . She's care-free and dresses below her age , much to the dismay of her boyfriend . It's not long before a rabbit turns up and she follows him down the rabbit hole ( after drinking a shrinking potion ) and ends up in Wonderland , where she meets the usual assortment of characters ; although in this film , they're all a bit more interested in sex than they were in the original story . The film really is very unprofessional and the effect is not too far removed from a school play . The costumes are ridiculous and the acting is terrible throughout . The film also features a plethora of songs that are very silly and helps to increase the ridiculousness of the film . However , despite all the problems ; this version of Alice in Wonderland does have a lot of charm and is at least a fun viewing . There's a fair few hardcore sex scenes ; but the focus of it actually seems to be more on the plot line , and all the sex is entwined in the story , with Lewis Carroll's characters the inspiration for most of it ! The film apparently underwent some cuts during its lifetime and the version I saw professed to have put everything that was cut back in ; although the film still only runs at about eighty minutes and fifteen of them are taken up by the final sex scene ! Overall , this is certainly an interesting film that will no doubt be a target for most fans of cult cinema ; but it is a very amateur production and even rated purely as a hardcore porn film ; it falls down compared to others in the genre . Still . . . I don't regret seeing it .

I couldn't detect much comedy in the film , which is odd because the killer is one of the most ridiculous I've ever seen , in that he goes around slashing people while wearing a giant bear suit ! There's a bit of decent gore , but it's not nearly enough to mask the drivel of the rest of the film . Strangely , considering that the main characters are all teenagers , there's not a great deal of sex and director Robert Deubel generally fails to create any atmosphere or generate any suspense at every interval . Of course , the fact that the film works from a poor script that doesn't deliver any characters that we can care about has a lot to do with the film's lack of suspense .

Text2: A Beautiful Film About the Delicacy of Humanity With "" The Bridge on the River Kwai , "" David Lean launched the string of "" epics-with-a-soul "" that would dominate the remainder of his career . In "" Kwai , "" Lean deftly juggles what seem like two entirely different movies to create one strong indictment of war's ability to strip men of their humanity . In one plot line , Alec Guinness , a British officer being held in a Japanese prison camp , locks horns with the commander of the camp ( Sessue Hayakawa ) , who puts Guinness and the other British soldiers in charge of constructing a bridge that will help the Japanese in their struggle to win the war . In the other dominant plot line , William Holden plays the leader of a platoon of men charged with blowing up said bridge . This plot line plays out like an exciting but fairly standard action film . It's the fascinating story of Guinness's transformation , not to mention his spectacular performance , that gives the film its status as a classic . The same quality of British perseverance that made Guinness such a loyal officer for the Allies works in Japanese favor as he becomes committed to building as fine a bridge as possible , forgetting its ultimate purpose . The film very eloquently communicates how noble attributes like loyalty and honor can be manipulated to satisfy what in certain circumstances can be perceived to be dubious ends , which , when you think about it ( though few people want to ) characterizes the basis of military recruitment everywhere . "" Kwai "" joined a batch of other 1957 releases - - like "" 12 Angry Men , "" "" Paths of Glory "" and "" Sweet Smell of Success "" - - in introducing a grittier and at the same time more poetic style of film-making that looked forward to the art-house style that would come into its own throughout the 1960s .

Several years pass , and , when they meet again , their passion is rekindled , forcing Allie to choose between her soul mate and class order . This beautiful tale has a particularly special meaning to an older gentleman ( James Garner ) who regularly reads the timeless love story to his aging companion ( Gena Rowlands ) , "" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . "" The Notebook "" is a pretty and predictable love story . Mr . Gosling and Ms . McAdams never seemed ( to me ) like they would age into characters like those essayed by Mr . Garner and Ms . Rowlands . Many times , the younger lovers appear to be modeling , rather than playing , their roles . The older couple is more enjoyable . Garner's performance , and narration , is particularly strong . James Marsden ( as Lon Hammond ) and Joan Allen ( as Anne Hamilton ) have interesting , underdeveloped roles . ( Ms . Allen may been channeling Ellen Burstyn's "" Lois Farrow "" ) . The "" teenage "" , and later , undressing scenes are very funny . And , some of the characters ' implausible actions ( the 365 letters , for example ) could be explained as embellishments and / or enhancements made by Rowlands ' character , in her "" The Story of Our Lives "" account . It is interesting that the lead characters write , at different times , a prolific amount of material to be read at a later time .

Laid-back photographer Jeff Rhodes ( a solid and engaging performance by Thom Meyers ) and his sweet newfound girlfriend Julie ( the adorable Laura Ellis ) do their best to stay alive and survive this harrowing ordeal . Writer / director Glen Coburn delivers a delightfully dry'n'deadpan tongue-in-cheek send-up of schlocky low-budget fright flicks that comes through with plenty of priceless gut-busting dialogue ( all-time favorite line : "" You cut my beeping arm off ! "" ) , broadly drawn redneck caricatures , and spot-on sidesplitting jokes about such worthy subjects as huffing nitrous oxide , kinky sex , racism , and gung-ho military fanaticism . Moreover , the make-up for the zombies is hilariously horrible and there's a few cool moments of gory over-the-top splatter which include a juicy decapitation , dismemberment , and several lovely shots of folks vomiting up uproariously unconvincing watery blood . The enthusiastic acting from a likable cast of mostly no-name amateurs further enhances the picture's considerable screwball appeal : Meyers and Ellis make for charming leads , Dennis Letts has a field day as brash ramrod General Sanders , token name Pat Paulsen contributes an amusing cameo as a preoccupied lecher President of the United States , plus there are neat turns by Robert Bradeen as the mean Uncle Joe , Kris Nicolau as nerdy Brit-accented doctor Jeri Jett , Chris Heldman as the amiable Deputy Sam , Big John Brigham as paranoid janitor Norman , Jim Stafford as the oafish Buford , and Billie Keller as the dotty Aunt Kate . The bleak and desolate Lone Star State locations add some tasty regional flavor to the infectiously wacky proceedings . The incredibly catchy'n'groovy 80's New Wave rock theme song seriously smokes . Chad D . Smith's purposefully static cinematography might be rough around the edges , but it does the trick all the same . A total riot .

I usually enjoy most everything David Carradine has done and I've grown to be a fan of these 70s chase films , but I found very little to enjoy here . The comedy elements don't work , the fight scenes seem lazily done , and the acting is terrible . The whole thing seems to have been thrown together in a hurry as a cash-in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit . It's too bad because I like the idea of pairing Carradine with Kate Jackson . The best parts of the film are easily some of the car and boat chase stunts . The swamp boat scenes were great . Problem is these moments are too few and far between .

Text2: Visit This Sideshow at Your Peril A forest glade somewhere in Europe . A warm , sunny day with children playing on the grass . But the camera moves closer and reveals that something is terribly wrong . For these are not children , but tragically misshapen human beings . Pinheads . Dwarfs . A young man with only half a body . A man without arms or legs . These are the Freaks . In 1932 , director Tod Browning , fresh from his success with DRACULA , was instructed by Irving Thalberg to top FRANKENSTEIN . He succeeded . The resulting film was considered so ghastly that it was banned in Britain for 30 years . It is the strangest film MGM ever released . Browning wanted to tell a tale of love , greed & revenge set in a circus , most particularly in the sideshow of human anomalies . He scoured Europe & America for the perfect cast . He got them : Violet & Daisy Hilton , the celebrated Siamese twins ; dwarf brother & sister Harry & Daisy Earles ; Johnny Eck the Half Boy ( a good actor , he will remain in your mind a long time ) ; the tragic Josephine Joseph , a hermaphrodite ; as well as a human skeleton , armless girls and the female pinheads , among others . While the plot is exploitive & the title tasteless , these people show us glimpses of their hearts , some of the agony of their condition and make us wonder , ' What if I'd been born as one of them ? ' The rest of the cast is made up of MGM stock players Leila Hyams , Wallace Ford , Edward Brophy , Olga Baclanova and the screen's champion stutterer Roscoe Ates . The plot is simple . A beautiful trapeze artist marries a dwarf for his money , then plots his murder with her lover , the circus strong man . The subsequent action is both horrifying & strangely satisfying .

"" I'm always pleasantly surprised at how entertaining some of these era films turn out to be , and with it's stellar cast , "" Captain Kidd "" is no exception . As the title character , Charles Laughton is at his finest , playing both sides of the sea lanes as it were , in the employ of the King of England while marauding the King's treasure at the same time . I got a kick out of one of Kidd's lines as King William ( Henry Daniell ) wishes him God speed for the voyage to Madagascar ; the response - "" I am but his unworthy sparrow "" . Shades of Pirates of the Caribbean ! All the while , Kidd plans on waylaying the Quida Merchant , laden with treasures from India . Those plans also include dispatching his closest pirate accomplices , celebrating each victory with a pen stroke through their names in his personal diary . I'm always amazed by that sort of plot device , as if the villain couldn't remember keeping track of a handful of his associates . It makes for mysterious intrigue though , as well as finality , though in the case of Orange Povey ( John Carradine ) , his name had to be rendered twice . Fans of Randolph Scott's Westerns will be aware of his many outfit changes during the course of a film , and it's no different here . Starting out in tatters as an imprisoned pirate , by the end of the story he's in a nobleman's attire with the lovely Barbara Britton on his arm . In between , we learn of Adam Mercy's masquerade as the King's informer to uncover his father's murderer ; who else but ? Rounding out Kidd's luckless original band are Gilbert Roland and a virtually unrecognizable Sheldon Leonard , who's character Boyle is sent to his reward following a flattering eulogy by Kidd , and then an unceremonious ' pop him over ' - beautiful ! If you set your history books aside , you'll have some swashbuckling good fun with this one . In particular , I enjoyed the language used by Kidd and the upper crusts , especially the scene at Hampton Palace . But for sheer delight , get a load of those pirate uniforms on board the ' Adventure Galley ' - didn't they look good in stripes ?


Text2: "" Leisurely hunter have time to stalk prey , but hunter in haste must set trap .

You know Charlie Chan is in for a rough investigation when it involves nine women , soon to be minus two , all members of an acting troupe on vacation in Malibu .

This is not a well regarded Charlie Chan film , for actor Sidney Toler it was his last portrayal of the Chinese detective . For me , the most interesting aspect of the film is when a former address of the killer is revealed to be 14 Rue Madeline , Paris , France .

332,"Text1: near classic prison noir / melodrama with excellent performances Brute Force is hard-hitting and ultimately quite tragic because the director , Jules Dassin , and his screenwriter Richard Brooks don't go for a simple , self-righteous "" bad guys always lose "" policy that movies had at the time thanks to the Legion of Decency and the Hayes Code . By the end of Brute Force , without giving a whole lot away , our ' heroes ' in the prison cell R-17 don't get away scott-free , but there's a greater indictment called upon that makes the film ultimately a lot richer than it would be in other hands . The film examines a penitentiary that has a warden but is basically run by cold-blooded , tyrannical Munsey ( Hume Cronyn , perfect for this weasel who is a true-blue torturer ) , and the convicts in cell R-17 , including Burt Lancaster in an early role as Joe Collins , among a handful of men who have committed crimes but are portrayed in flashback as not being particularly ruthless or horrible in their acts or deeds . If anything , Dassin and Brooks set up a particular sympathy for the criminals that might have just skirted by the strict side of the Hayes Code ( I wonder if the last words of the film , however crushing in existential tone , were forced on the filmmakers by the Hayes people ) by making the situation not really black and white at all . On the contrary , Brute Force is an alive and harsh piece of film-noir with some searing scenes of melodrama because there's some gray territory ( i . e . if it was black and white the Warden , too , would be ruthless and corrupt , but he just wants to run an orderly prison that his inmates will respect , unlike Munsey ) . Many scenes have that edge of a thriller , those surprise scenes that keep you talking after the picture ends like the guy getting crushed under the gears of the machine , or the torturing of the ' reporter ' , or even those somewhat predictable but heart-rending flashbacks that the prisoners have to their sweethearts on the other side ( some , sadly , divorcing , others sick and need care ) . All the while the performances are top-notch , especially from Cronyn , Lancaster , Bickford and Levine as Louie Miller . Sometimes it's hard to pull off a really surprising prison-break-out flick , but Jules Dassin treats it with the same entertainment value , as well as general tragic pathos , that made films like Rififi so memorable . It's a tough "" guy "" flick that has a heart .


Text2: into the methods and mind and soul of Tarkovsky It's of the utmost value for anyone interested in film-making - those who just love watching how they're made or want to be / are filmmakers - to see this documentary , which chronicles the making of Tarkovsky's last film , the Sacrifice , as well as peers into the personal dimensions of him as an artist . If only for one section is the film a must-see ; it's staggering to see the horror and triumph of the climactic house burning scene in the Sacrifice , how all the elements came together , crumbled , and then they went back and did it all over again . It's a moral lesson , in a sense , for the filmmaker , and a kind of primary example of what it is to dedicate oneself to the technical preference . If Tarkovsky had filmed the scene today he would've had the option of digital , without the possibility ( as it turns out here ) of the film jamming in the camera . But then this is only one piece of the concern over the sequence : all the elements , the special effects , the blaze of the fire , the movement of the camera , the actors hitting their marks precisely as if this were all on the theater stage , have to come together in one fell swoop . And being Tarkovsky , you know the intensity involved . But then this is just one part of what is already an impressive example of a director profile . We see his thoughts and philosophies expounded upon about making his cinema one of total and utter personal expression , about dealing with the actors , the scrupulous attention to detail which he pretty much all oversees from the color of dresses to the shape of a couch . And , after a while , we see why he's comparable himself to the filmmakers he mentions ( i . e . Bresson , Bergman , Bunuel , Kurosawa ) who all create their own kinds of ' worlds ' in the movies they make , as opposed to just imitating a reality . He almost appears to come too close to being in a personal realm of expression , like some painter or poet who can't get out of his own head-space with the thoughts he has , the dreams he remembers , and the visions that are brought on by certain feelings in memories . But then he also has it in him to strive for tapping into the audience without being very obvious . If there is manipulation to his art , it is in no way of conventional commercial means . Which means , of course , Tarkovsky isn't for everyone ( some of his long takes can last about the length of an infomercial ) . But if you're interested in knowing more about the iconoclast director behind Stalker and Solaris and the Sacrifice ( not to forget Andrei Rublev ) , then you're more than likely already a fan , or have some interest in a personal Russian cinema . And as we see with him on the set with the Sacrifice , and the control he has along with the method of concise collaboration , it's no wonder his sister ( I think it's his sister ) comments that he , at the time he was alive , had freedom than any other filmmaker from his native country . Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky is an insightful peek into this late , great film / poet / scholar / dreamer / et all .

But I think the duo that took this movie was Morris and Jarome , their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious . I just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because I felt that it was what made the movie . Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music .

Soames hasn't exactly gone down well in the annals of cinematic history ; given the fact that it has been pretty much forgotten since its release almost forty years ago . I'm not surprised really ; despite an interesting premise , the film is not all that memorable and the idea is not handled as well as it could have been ; plus , there are better movies on the topic . The movie was apparently made by Amicus , who of course were most famous for their horror anthologies , and the film is really not what I have come to expect from the UK's number two horror movie producing studio . The plot focuses on Mr Soames ; a man who was somehow born in a coma and has been in one ever since . He is now thirty years old and has lived all his life in a hospital where he is cared for , despite not being aware of it , by the doctors and nurses . There is a medical breakthrough and finally it is possible to awaken Mr Soames ; which happens in a public operation . After he is finally awakened , he's subjected to a scheme to make him mature into a man . . . but things go awry when he escapes . The idea that this film is based on is undoubtedly interesting , though probably not possible . There's many ways that a plot like this could be handled , and while in this film it is handled much better and more skilfully than in , say , 1973's The Baby , the result is still disappointing . The film is slow to start and not a great deal happens for the first half of the movie as we get to watch the central sleeping and then learning and not much else . The most interesting part of the movie comes in the second half when the man / child escapes into the real world and this is also the most disappointing part of it as it doesn't resolve anything and we don't get to know much about the central character's condition . The film is largely well made ; Alan Cooke could have implemented more suspense but his direction is assured and Terence Stamp is convincing enough in the lead role . It all boils down to a very unsatisfying climax as the ending does not resolve anything which really is a shame . Overall , this is not a completely bad film ; but I can't say I enjoyed it much and I don't recommend going out of your way to track it down !


Text2: Another excellent exhibition of horror from Italy ! You can always count on an inventive and intriguing movie when it comes to anything that Argento has touched , and this Argento-scripted film is just that ! The great director has left the directorial duties up to his prot√©g√© ; Michele Soavi for this movie , and that is somewhat ironic because The Sect easily tops anything that Argento himself directed in the 1990's . Michele Soavi looked pretty promising up until 1994 when he released the astonishing ' Dellamorte Dellamore ' , and then promptly disappeared off the horror radar . It's a massive shame that the man , up until now , hasn't followed up on his four horror films ; as I , and many other horror fans ( I'm sure ) , would agree that if he'd added a few more films to his oeuvre ; he could be right up there with the master himself . The plot for this film follows a young woman who almost knocks a man down while driving in her car . She then takes the man home , but due to the events that transpire ; it quickly becomes obvious that she didn't take him home purely by chance . . . As soon as the movie opens , with America's "" Horse With No Name "" , and then a character quoting lyrics from The Rolling Stones ' "" Sympathy for the Devil "" , you just know that you're going to be in for a great ride ; and the rest of the film doesn't disappoint ! Soavi succeeds in creating a fabulously foreboding atmosphere throughout the movie , and his direction isn't bad either . The locations are great ; the underwater labyrinth underneath the house at the centre of the movie , which echoes Inferno , being the very best in that department ! Soavi excels at direction , and this only reinforces my point about the massive shame it is that he hasn't followed up on Dellamorte Dellamore . His camera angles are superb and he really knows how to build tension and suspense ! Herbert Lom is the pick of the cast , and the classic horror actor delivers an excellent hammy performance and every moment he's on screen is a delight . The film definitely does have problems , however ; the fact that it's about twenty minutes overlong is one of them , and the rather silly ending is another - but on the whole , this is an excellent exhibition of horror and comes with a high recommendation from yours truly !

From this point the film follows the trek across the open country to get to safety . The battle scenes are absolutely terrible .

Text2: Murder on the Chicago to L . A . Express The novelty of this Richard Fleischer-directed crime thriller rests on the fact that nearly the entire film takes place on board a train . Fleischer , who was adept at slicking up pulpy B material and giving it style to spare , treats the cramped shooting spaces as an advantage rather than a liability - - he uses extreme closeups , packed compositions and clever reflections ( in train windows , mirrors , etc . ) to enhance the story's claustrophobic appeal . No where is this more apparent than in a wild fist fight that takes place in a tiny mens ' room . The story surrounds a hard-boiled detective's ( Charles McGraw , who looks like he was born to play leading men in B noirs ) efforts to escort a dead mobster's wife to L . A . so that she can testify in front of a grand jury . The bad guys want to bump her off before she gets there , but they don't know what she looks like . McGraw delivers the tough-guy patter with confidence , and Marie Windsor ( who reminded me a bit of the contemporary actress Illeana Douglas ) swaggers her way through the role of a gangster's moll with flair . When McGraw tells her at one point that her amorality makes him sick , she replies , "" Use somebody else's sink . "" A plot twist toward the film's end caught me completely off guard .

It's also great to see the actors in the film work so well , including Chris Tucker - given more to do here emotionally than any other film he's done - and a small part from Keith David , who's somewhat underrated in his time as a fantastic character actor . Then there's also the bank heist , which is in and of itself dynamite , and the main plot of the deterioration of the romance between the characters that gets frightening . Even the resolution , which seems very matter-of-fact and bleak ( watching Tucker on the couch ' watching ' the Al Green song is a sobering moment ) , works very well . Dead Presidents isn't truly great art or whatever , but it does showcase the talents of the Hughes brothers better - or at least with more articulation and determination - than any other they've made ( and all four they've done are well done , particularly From Hell and Menace 2 Society ) .


Text2: A gem that already needs rediscovering Undervalued film in the Coen Brothers canon . I liked it much more than their previous two films , The Man Who Wasn't There and O Brother , Where Art Thou ? I don't know how anyone could think they were selling out with this , because it still has that patented Coen quirk , this time revisiting the classical Hollywood romantic comedy . It's nothing like modern romantic comedies , but closer to stuff like Adam's Rib and Bringing Up Baby . George Clooney , turning in his best performance ever , is a divorce lawyer who never loses , even when the odds are stacked against him . Catherine Zeta-Jones is the gold-digging wife of a philandering , rich husband ( Edward Herrmann ) , who has in turn hired Clooney to defend him . The dialogue is perfect , and the plot takes a lot of fun and unexpected turns . All the performances are excellent ; in addition to the leads , Cedric the Entertainer , Billy Bob Thorton , Paul Adelstein , and Richard Jenkins among others are simply awesome . No movie from 2003 made me laugh nearly as hard . Actually , I think I haven't seen a comedy that was this much fun since Bowfinger in 1999 . .

Foxy solves this by getting a pin and literally deflating her to small size ! Offended , she backwards insults him and goes on her way . Foxy later picks his girlfriend up as they sing the theme song ( I must tell you here that except for the bushy tails and ears , they both resemble Mickey and Minnie Mouse .

Text2: Assignment : Miami Beach OK , I'm starting to see the slump in the police academy sequels , it is number 5 , Assignment : Miami Beach , where we've lost Steve Guttenberg and the jokes are not as funny as they used to be . Now , don't get me wrong , this movie did make me laugh , but so far this was definitely the more weaker of the sequels . Again , the only thing that makes it worth it though is the original cast members , like Bubba Smith , Michael Winslow , and G . W . Bailey , but it seems like they're almost getting sick of the sequels too . But the story is really weak , that's the downfall , it's just not doing it for me , even though none of the Police Academy movies are realistic , this movie goes above being unrealistic , it has Bubba Smith fighting a crocodile for Pete's sake . Not to mention , not only do they not have Steve Guttenberg back , but there is no Zed or Sweetchuck , I loved those characters . The Class of ' 84 are going to see their favorite Commandant Lasard get an award for all his hard service in Miami , they are all invited together . But Captain Harris is displeased with his placement and wants to be commandant , so he figures since they are pushing Lasard into retirement , he can be a hero down there , and will do anything to get that promotion he feels he deserves . Off the flight , Lasard gets the wrong bag where he thinks his fish is , but instead has a camera with hidden jewels , not knowing he is being followed by thugs to get the diamonds back . Police Academy 5 : Assignment : Miami Beach isn't a bad movie by any means , like I said there are still some good laughs in it . I loved how Lasard gets kidnapped , but he thinks it's all part of the program and just goes with it saying to the thugs "" thank you , you have been a wonderful kidnapper "" , it was so stupid , but I loved watching him play along . Also Harris is always a blast to watch , he's such a great jerk , you love to hate him , but you still end up wanting him back for more . So if you're going to watch this movie , I'd recommend watching it if you're just looking to finish the sequels , it's the weakest I've seen so far , but still worth a look .

Text2: So This Is Paris Hollywood Paramount had a specialty of sex comedies set in Paris , France from the mid-twenties until the Production Code closed them down in 1935 . At that point , the Screwball Comedy arose . As long as they were doing comedies in Paris , they did a couple of straight programmers set there too . In this one , William Powell plays an American in Paris who , while trying to write , makes a living by an interesting blackmail scam - - I've never heard of it before . This movie , with a script by Herman J . Mankiewicz and a good cast has a chance of being very good . But except for William Powell , as always , charming , and Guy Kibbee's emphatic muddleheadedness , director Richard Wallace seems to be unable to raise a decent performance . Carole Lombard keeps threatening to disappear into the background , Lawrence Grey seems impossibly callow , and Wynne Gibson seems to be reading her speeches phonetically off a blackboard . One wants to like this movie and there are a few moments when it appears on the brink of turning into something very interesting , like the scene over onion soup at 1 AM , but then it turns into another pointless costume change . William Powell's career was stuck at this point : he was trying to make the change from screen villain to leading man , but couldn't quite get the right vehicles . He would leave Paramount for Warner's until he struck gold at Metro in 1934 . But he always remained a character actor , capable of small or broad performances that would delight the audiences . It's a pity he's not strong enough to carry this movie by himself .

Text2: show biz can't satisfy anyone One thing that I've always wondered is why no one looks at Hollywood more negatively than Hollywood itself . But whatever the reason , "" The Bad and the Beautiful "" pulls no punches in looking at its topic . The movie portrays some people explaining how they used to be friends of producer Jonathan Shields ( Kirk Douglas ) but have since turned against him . There's the director whom Shields promised a directing job but betrayed him , the writer who lost his wife to Shields's actions , and the actress whom Shields drove to madness . I thought that one of the most effective scenes in the movie was Kirk Douglas holding Lana Turner in his arms . Here he is , this overbearing , hostile character forced to almost coddle his gorgeous female star ; it might be showing how he may seemingly have exalted her , but he remains in a higher position and is merely using her and sending her into insanity . And the scene of her driving the car while completely upset elaborates on this idea . And then , there's the writer . He and his wife move from Virginia hoping to get really big in Hollywood . . . until tragedy strikes . It all goes to show the disaster inherent in any industry ( of course , Douglas's character exacerbates any problem ) .

He keeps asking his mother what happened to his father , and eventually learns that his mother betrayed him to the Franco government because of his unspoken leftist ideas . Fando imagines bizarre scenarios where his father is tortured and mutilated . Many of his visions present his mother as a monster who gouges out his father's eyes , or makes love to his captors in front of him , in addition to other gruesome and scatological horrors . Fando also shows signs of sexual interest in his libidinous aunt Clara and a neighbor girl , Th√©r√®se , as he lives a miserable existence acting out the cruelty of his mother with small cruelties of his own . Fernando Arrabal is a well-known Spanish surrealist and "" Viva la Muerte "" is his first and most famous piece of work . The film has its share of shocking and unpleasant moments-the defecation scene and the bull slaughter moment especially come to my mind . Many of the hallucinatory scenes of violence , that include the father's head being stomped on by horses , a priest's genitals being cut off , and imagined sexual liaisons involving Fando's mother , were filmed on videotape , distorted via the use of colour filters and transferred to film . So if you liked this one I'd also recommend "" Sweet Movie "" and "" The Cremator "" . .

345,"Text1: From the people who gave you St . Elsewhere TATTINGERS is an example of the hit and miss aspect of production success in television . The writers and staff who created the excellent medical show ST . ELSEWHERE decided to branch out and make this similar comedy / drama about a famous New York City restaurant called TATTINGERS . It was supposed to be on par with Le Cirq or "" 21 "" , and it was owned by Nick Tattinger ( Stephen Collins ) , who is divorced from his wife Hillary ( Blythe Danner ) . They have two daughters . Part of the plot , by the way , is not described in the description that was given on the thread . Nick was shot and seriously wounded when he found some local drug dealer trying to sell drugs to his older daughter . He knocked the guy down , and started taking the girl home , when the drug dealer recovers , pulls out a gun , and shoots Nick . At the time the show began , Nick has recovered , but the dealer has gotten out of prison , and he is constantly harassing Nick and his staff , causing food deliveries to be sidetracked or delayed or stolen , and also occasionally invading the precincts of the restaurant . Now that point alone shows you a problem with the show's scripts . On ST . ELSEWHERE , the writers frequently showed their disillusion with the American justice system by having criminals get early release , or not get caught or convicted , or by having people we sympathize with who commit crimes and go to prison as a result . They obviously took this feeling into TATTINGERS , but went too far . In the real world , if this drug dealer was harassing his shooting Victim and his restaurant ( as he is ) it would likely lead to the dealer returning to prison . In the super real world , Nick would probably have the drug dealer dealt with in a final method that would not bear looking into by the police . Instead they had this harassment involved with the shows for too long . It made no sense at all . But what was far worse was the engine that geared up for every episode's plot . Instead of trying to build stories around the workings of the staff , their hopes and dreams , and their private lives , the writers quickly tried to use a rather hackneyed plot idea again and again and again . Nick claims ( in the first episode ) that he has many friends , and frequently finds himself doing favors for people . Well , that happens - but not with the idiotic frequency that it happens to Nick . It is reminiscent of two episodes ( at least ) on M . A . S . H . , where Hawkeye has some simple problem to cure and has to arrange ( or try to arrange ) half-a-dozen or so exchanges of favors before he can get that new boot he needs , or get that furlough set up or whatever . The episodes on M . A . S . H . that used this became so predictable that they are among the least funny of that series . Here it was done weekly as the plot . And it was less than successful here to . In real life , somebody who found his friends so frequently demanding so much help with "" favors "" would wonder if it would make sense to find a new set of friends . There were some interesting moments on the show . The aged George Abbott and Garson Kanin appeared in one episode as themselves , proclaiming they were TATTINGERS regulars . In another episode there was a cute joke , about a demanding customer who was coming named Mr . Wilkes . When he showed up , the maitre'd said , "" Where is Mr . Wilkes ' booth ? "" There was even a reference to the more successful ST . ELSEWHERE . An actor who played a doctor on ST . ELSEWHERE ( who had died of a heart attack on that show ) appeared as a lawyer in an episode of TATTINGERS . He is complaining about his recent problems , mostly about his cases , and then adds , "" And my favorite cousin Eliott just dropped dead at the hospital he worked at in Boston ! "" . That was the name of the character on ST . ELSEWHERE . The actors did their best . Besides Collins and Danner , noteworthy work was done by

Text2: Cary Grant as a South Sea Island "" Rat "" It was not quite what Cary Grant wanted , but it was certainly different . In his whole career he wanted to play a negative role - a person who was not debonair or likable but a villain . At time he was defeated by his own agent and the production studio from being a wife killer ( SUSPICION ) or a labor agitator suspected of arson murder ( THE TALK OF THE TOWN ) or he played a Cockney gad-about who confronts a mobster ( NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART ) or he played a gambler thinking of swindling a war-time tragedy ( MR . LUCKY ) , or a suspected jewel thief ( TO CATCH A THIEF ) or a successful university professor who was targeted by a jealous rival ( PEOPLE WILL TALK ) . But while some of these parts approached the villain he wanted to play , none hit the actual target . In 1964 Grant finally got a chance to undercut his sophisticated , sharp dressing style . He got the chance to play South Sea island rat Walter Eckland , a grizzled loner who has little use for the modern world , and a large appetite for alcohol . The film was the film comedy FATHER GOOSE , co-starring Leslie Caron as Catherine Freneau ( the daughter of a French colonial governor ) , and Trevor Howard as Commander Frank Houghton of the Royal Navy . Again , Grant was cheated out of the full chance of playing a disreputable type . Eckland is disreputable ( he is first seen trying to steel gasoline supplies needed by the royal navy which is fleeing a threatened dockyard - for his own cabin cruiser ) . But by the time the film ends he is shown to be heroic . Fortunately it is a comedy , with it's three leads playing well off each other . Grant is dragooned by Howard into being an island watcher for the British navy against Japanese planes and ships . To keep Grant from splitting , Howard wrecks the cabin cruiser , and he hides Grant's supply of alcohol . It works , but a few months later Grant is informed he has to perform a rescue from another island across the sea . He only does it when Howard informs him where the rest of the alcohol is hidden . Then he goes , only to find it is Caron and six little school girls left in her care when evacuating a French island . Almost immediately there is friction between Grant and Caron as to proper behavior in front of the girls , and in serving the young ladies and Caron first . When they get back to Grant's island , Caron has the young girls hide his liquor all over again . It has been suggested that Grant and Caron were playing roles similar to Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in THE African QUEEN . Certainly in the relationship of Charlie and Rosie in that film there is a definite resemblance to that of Walter and Catherine . But this kind of "" opposite attracts "" appears before THE African QUEEN did . In VESSEL OF WRATH ( set in the South Seas in the 1930s ) the hard-drinking Charles Laughton ran afoul of missionary Elsa Lanchester . As with the other two pairings they eventually fall in love . But the humor in FATHER GOOSE is Grant's attempts to maintain his control over the island , even while thrown out of his hut by Caron and her charges . Every time he tries to show who is boss , he's undercut by the ladies . Howard ( although at a distance ) is no real help - the war is of first importance to Allied planning , not rescuing angry drunken island rats . It is only when Grant shows that he can fish but Caron cannot that he starts reducing her ascendancy over him , and the cap-off is when he believes she is dying of snake poison , and she is made comfortable by large cups of Grant's booze in a coconut cup . With her hair down she suddenly is not so inhumane to Grant . FATHER GOOSE is Cary Grant's last lead role . He hoped he would soon pass into supporting parts , but although the film did well at the box office ( I saw it when it came out - the audiences were packed ) , it confused many who did not care for Grant being scruffy . The result was that Grant made one more comic film ( WALK DON'T RUN ) wherein he played the Charles","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Sean Penn was Oscar-nominated for his role as Sam , a mentally retarded father who hires a savvy lawyer ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) to represent him in a custody trial involving his daughter ( Dakota Fanning ) . The courts think Sam isn't fit to be a father due to his mental limitations , but Sam feels otherwise . As Pfeiffer begins representing Sam she realizes he is a good father and feels an emotional attachment to the case that she hasn't experienced when dealing with criminals and the sort . This film came out and received generally negative reviews in 2001 , which I was surprised at considering it's an enjoyable movie .

Text2: In Glorious Technicolor and Cinemascope and STEREOPHONIC SOUN It is Cole Porter meeting Ernst Lubitsch's best recalled film , NINOTCHKA . Up-dated to be sure , but still an affective comedy about rival systems of politics , social structure , and economics . In the original , a Soviet economic mission is trying to use some jewelry that was originally owned by a Grand Duchess to purchase needed agricultural equipment . This is jettisoned in the new version . Fred Astaire ( Steve Canfield ) is a movie producer who is planning a production of WAR AND PEACE with Janis Paige as his star ( she is Peggy Dayton , a noted Hollywood swim star , a la Esther Williams ) , who will play the Empress Josephine . Interesting point : Josephine does not appear in WAR AND PEACE - keep that in mind . Canfield wants to have a score by Russia's leading composer , Peter Ilyitsch Boroff ( Wim Sonneveld ) who is currently in Paris with a culture mission that is under Jules Munshin , Peter Lorre , and Alexander Granach . Their boss , George Tobias ( promoted since NINOTCHKA - he's now a commissar ) sends Cyd Charisse ( Ninotchka Yoschencko ) to keep the other three and Boroff under control . Tobias has reason to be upset . Not only is Canfield trying to corrupt the culture mission ( not too difficult there ) but also Boroff , who falls for Peggy Dayton ( as Canfield hopes ) . It follows closely the pursuit and "" corruption "" of Ninotchka , but there is one aspect that is shown here that was barely touched upon in the 1939 film . There Swanna's cynical use of the jewelry as a bargaining chip to keep Leon from Ninotchka sort of suggests that pure capitalism has it's drawbacks when in the wrong hands . In SILK STOCKINGS it is the cavalier use of culture for a fast buck that gets a go over . Boroff's masterpiece is called "" Overture to a tractor "" , but Canfield has it changed into a song for Peggy "" Jo , Jo , Jo , Jo , Josephine . . . commonly called Jo "" . Whatever one thinks of music in honor of inanimate objects , Boroff's work represents serious art . Ninotchka and the others ( including Boroff ) are furious , and dismiss the glib excuse Steve comes up with ( many other popular songs are based on classic tunes ) . They leave for Russia , and the rest of the musical follows Steve's attempts ( like Leon's before him ) to get Ninotchka back . The Porter score here ( with the score for CAN-CAN ) were the last two really first rate scores Porter composed , but both were composed for the stage productions of the musicals and transposed to the screen . Here the title song ( originally sung by Don Ameche on stage , but here by Astaire ) is one of the best numbers , as is "" Glorious Technicolor "" , where Astaire and Paige describe all the cinematography gimmicks used to draw in the audience ( leading up to "" sterophonic sound "" , which the film sound track blasts out ) . Munchkin , Lorre , and Granach have two big numbers , the second ( SIBERIA ) being one of Porter's best comic pieces as the three culture mission people look gloomily to returning to Russia , and possibly being sent to Siberia ( "" Have you seen our choice bill of fare . . . Please try the fillet of polar bear ! "" ) . There is even a second piece by "" Boroff "" composed in Russia , "" I've got the Red Blues ! "" which uses forbidden rock and roll . If it does not have the fine Lubitsch elegance and "" touch "" , SILK STOCKINGS still shows a first rate handling on it's own .

Erbe corners him and demands to know what's wrong with her husband . "" He's a receiver "" , explains the cop , "" like a man with a flashlight that goes on and off . "" The girl he's been hallucinating is a ghost and eventually she will ask him for something . And the boy ? "" He's got a much bigger flashlight . "" So saying , he closes the door and isn't heard from again . In an attempt to rid himself of these ictal states , Bacon has Douglas rehypnotize him , but this time the word that appears on the screen is DIG . So Bacon starts digging - - first the back yard and then the cellar . Finally , accidentally , he bangs a hole in the wall and uncovers the mummified body of the girl in his vision . So far , so Steven King . In particular , a blend of "" The Shining "" , with Scatman Crothers as the twigged black guy , "" The Tommyknockers "" with the digging and "" Firestarter , "" in which the little girl has a much bigger flashlight than her father . Seeing the credits , realizing that the story was based on a Richard Matheson novel , cleared things up a bit . It isn't that Matheson cribbed from King , but the other way around . The Matheson story appeared earlier . And ( I suppose ) , Poe's "" The Cask of Amantillado "" was even earlier . The first two thirds of the movie I found a little unfocused . Those nightmarish fragmented visions are as pointless to the viewer as they are to Kevin Bacon . They seem implanted in the story to provide the generic shocks that jaded fans of horror movies have become accustomed to . Clich√©s , one and all , and not very interestingly done . When , in its last act , the film turns into a story of murder and the circumstances endanger Bacon , all the supernatural business comes together and things get a lot more prosaic and a lot more interesting . A question is raised , a new question . Not , "" What the hell is going on ? "" , but , "" Will one friend kill another in order to protect a loved one ? "" Bacon does an efficient job . Katheryn Erbe isn't a magnetic actress but the script provides us with a shower scene from the rear in which she seems to glory in her bilateral symmetry . Their little boy is just a little boy and I don't know why he's there except to pump up our worry quotient . He should be stomped on . One of the ancillary virtues of the movie is that it does such a splendid job of capturing a working-class Chicago neighborhood without any obvious display of effort . We get to know those musty , decaying houses pretty well . We can almost smell the black soil of their back yards . And neither the Sears Tower nor The Loop appears in any of the shots .

He is trying to reconcile himself to his present circumstances . Arriving at the small southern town , he must do good work in order to attract a faithful congregation . He doesn't have much to fear , just leave it Opal to get everyone together in a place where people have grown apart . The great book by Kate DiCamillo , is an excellent book for young adults . Joan Singleton adapted it for the screen and Wayne Wang directed a nice cast that produced a movie that , while some would think it's too sugary for their taste , it captured perfectly the essence of a small southern town . The sweet AnnaSophia Robb plays the leading role . This young actress is a natural , or so it seems . Jeff Daniels , one of our best actors is seen as the preacher who can't forget his wife and who has to come to terms with himself . Cicely Tyson and Eva Maria Saint are perfect as two of the town's oldest citizens that are won over by Opal's goodness . Elle Fanning is seen as Sweetie Pie , a lovely girl . B . J . Hopper and Dave Mathews also contributed to the film . This film was clearly targeted for young audiences . It has the right ingredients that prove to be a magical combination for family movies , a girl and a cute dog , a sure formula for appealing to audiences . Wayne Wang , an unlikely choice for director , brings all these elements together for a film that will not disappoint .


Text2: Unlikely neighbors "" Unhook the stars "" marked the directorial film debut of Nick Casavettes , the son of the immensely talented John Casavettes and Gena Rowlands . This is clearly the director's homage to his beautiful mother , which probably was the reason this film was made . The screen play by the director and Helen Caldwell , doesn't translate to a good film , as we watch the finished product . Mr . Casavettes ' heart is in the right place , but the movie , as written , doesn't make much sense . First of all , one wonders where Mildred went wrong . Her daughter Annie is a mess . Her son , the yuppie , lives in his own material world . We would like to think Mildred and her late husband created a nice environment for these two children . They both turned out to be losers in their own right . Mildred's neighbors don't belong in her neighborhood . One wonders how the probably low wage earner , Monica , can live across the street from Mildred's better than average home . A lady like Mildred would probably have told Monica off from the beginning . The way Monica curses in every sentence would have been a turn off factor for Mildred . Of course , we know she goes along because suddenly she has found the sweet little J . J . that Monica dumps on her . Monica and Mildred live in two different worlds and it's hard for us to accept their situation because Monica shows no redeeming qualities , except the love for her son . Mildred , on the other hand , doesn't have a clue about how to reach out for her daughter . The only positive thing Mildred does is to sell the house and go into a new life . Miami in her future ? The other thing that doesn't make sense is to watch the elegant Mildred going to the dive where Monica takes her to drink . Big Tommy's interest in her , while it might be sexual , is not fully realized either because they stick out like oil and vinegar . There is no chemistry between Mildred and this big French Canadian guy . Gena Rowlands does an excellent job as Mildred . She is always serene and composed . That's why Marisa Tomei over acting , the way she does , looks completely out of place , next to Mildred . Jake Lloyd is sweet and not bratty as J . J . , the boy who loves Mildred until his father comes back home . Moira Kelly's Annie is an enigma . David Sherrill and Bridgette Wilson play Mildred's son and daughter-in-law . Poor Gerard Depardieu , a great star in his native France , doesn't have a thing to show for himself . M . Depardieu should choose more carefully his future films in America ! With the exception of "" She's so Lovely "" , which reminded us more of his father's influence , and "" John Q "" , Nick Casavettes hasn't made a name for himself as of yet . It would be a great help for Mr . Casavettes to study his father's films , then , perhaps , he would find an inspiration for directing more movies that will showcase his talent . This one , or "" The Notebook "" , alas , don't help him at all .

350,"Text1: James Cagney as you've never seen him before . James Cagney is of course best known for his tough gangster roles but he has also done his fair share of musical roles throughout his career . It was also how he started out his career and the theater was perhaps also were truly his heart really was . This was also the movie which earned Cagney his only Oscar win and he really deserved it . It's a kind of role I have never seen him playing before and it's perhaps not only the best role out of his career , it's also one of the best movie performances I have ever seen . Cagney is especially great as the older George M . Cohan . The movie is based on the real life of musical composer , playwright , actor , dancer and singer George Micheal Cohan , who made many famous musical shows and songs throughout his career . Cagney plays him with a lot of heart and really becomes the character , from a young man till the old aging , gray Cohan . It's a quite patriotic movie , after all Cohan's plays featured a lot of flag waving and stuff like that but in this case it doesn't work out distracting or annoying since the movie doesn't lay its emphasis on it . It's a movie that tells the story of a man and it concentrates on that , rather than focusing on the things and life surrounding him , at least not until the end , when WW I kicks in and George's parents start to age . A true biography , that just gets better by the minute . It's also not a movie you would expect from director Michael Curtiz , who mostly made swashbucklers and early thrillers and action flicks throughout his career . But just like James Cagney he has done his fair share of musicals . Just like Cagney as well , he just isn't best known for that type work . The musical moments are all grand looking and besides feature some good songs . And I'm normally speaking not even a fan of the musical genre in general . Watching this is however a real treat . You can also tell Cagney is really in his element during those musical moments . A real triumph and a pinnacle within its genre , not in the least thanks to a magnificent acting , singing and dancing James Cagney .


Text2: Best movie so far this summer ! Spoilers ! ! The original is a classic that I have seen one too many times , which made Arnold . The second film , left its science fiction roots , and became a special effects film , without much of a story . A lot of films have plot holes , but how could John Conners exist without the first film happening . No bratty kid , social cause and effects ( ie the security guard why don't I kill , the science guy change of mind ) , Linda Hamilton giving a PC social lecture , and effects with no need like the truck scene . T3 had to change from the first 2 , and this makes it a strong film . The over the top action scenes add humor for the film . Arnold acts more like a machine , and becomes a strong secondary character ; smart move for Arnold . It shows he can step back for the good of the film . Arnold's computer behavior is comical ! Most science fiction has philosophy , and this film deals with fatalism . This film answers the question why does John Conner exist . As a result of fate , the second film only delayed the inevitable . One must deal with their fate . Chaos theory with free will creates order to chaos and events unfold . The strongest part of this film is the believability with the science fiction . In 1984 , Sky Net takes over , was science fiction , but with the net , and the grid cyber war , it is possible . This would damage the financial , power , communications system etc . I watched a show about cyber war on the Learning Channel , with what the NSC could do and with Sky net and the virus it is plausible . Add the sci-fi , time travel and anything is possible . The ending is mind blowing with fatalism . 7 or 8 out 10 .

Did it make sense to all that while her young sister was dying , she went off to Europe with her maiden aunt , nicely played by Lucile Watson .

Text2: I Was Up in Arms After Seeing this Picture A colossal Danny Kaye bomb . It's amazing that Danny's film career went anywhere after a film as miserable as this . This was not the film to showcase his talents . Dana Andrews was not for musicals . It was as simple as that . He played his sidekick in this and was Jeanne Crain's love interest in "" State Fair . "" Andrews hit his stride in "" The Best Years of Our Lives . "" Danny is a severe hypochondriac in this film . He gets drafted and loves Constance Dowling who doesn't have the heart to tell him that it's Andrews who is her love interest . Dinah Shore , as Virginia , loves Danny but he can't see it . General mayhem develops when all 4 of the characters are on the ship and Dowling becomes a castaway by accident . Look for Margaret Dumont in 2 brief scenes . I guess she was taking a respite from the Marx Brothers . She is not even at her gawky best here . Also miscast are Louie Calhern and Lyle Talbot , both wonderful character actors , who have little to do here and are wasted . Dinah sings nicely and I guess that she and Kaye make a nice Jewish couple . That's about it .

Well , this little movie may be a romantic comedy but it is well written ( Kriss Turner ) , well directed ( Sanaa Hamri ) , and very well acted and has some down to earth important observations about interpersonal relationships . . . and , oh yes , it deal with interracial issues , beautifully ! Kenya ( Sanaa Lathan - Best Man , Blade , The Wood , etc ) is a beautiful Type A personality , an overachiever who is up for Partner in her Accounting Firm : she has no time to search for IMB ( Important Black Man ) as her list of qualifications is far too extensive . Her fellow professional girlfriends ( Wendy Raquel Robinson , Golden Brooks and Taraji P . Henson - all superb ! ) encourage her to date to ' go with the flow ' and a fellow business associate sets her up with a blind date - the very handsome , hunky , landscape architect Brian Kelly ( Simon Baker - superb actor from Tasmania , Australia has starred in LA Confidential , Book of Love , The Ring Two , The Affair of the Necklace etc ) - and despite the fact that Kenya refuses to consider dating any man who is not black , she does accept Brian's card and in no time hires him to landscape her new home . The usual dating events occur : Simon is an educated , laid-back , tender , thoughtful , adventuresome male who happens to fall in love with the closely guarded Kenya ; when introduced at parties Simon falls victim to prejudice form black men AND form Kenya's parents ; Kenya gradually succumbs to Brian's charms and despite all misgivings they begin an affair . But peer pressures , work demands , and Kenya's self doubt jumble matters and she decides she must search for a black man . One ' just happens ' to appear as Mark ( Blair Underwood ) and for a moment Kenya believes she has found her ideal - until her heart speaks up and she for the first time is honest with her emotions and follows her true heart's desire . The apparent disparity between Kenya and Brian is handled in a sensitive and realistic way and Lathan and Baker have a sizzling screen chemistry . The supporting roles are in excellent hands : in addition to those mentioned above there are fine roles by Alfre Woodward , Earl Billings , Donald Faison , Mike Epps etc . This is a fine little film that approaches the touchy subject of black professional women who are unmarried ( ' 42 . 4 Percent ' was the working title ) and for once shows an interracial film that is more a sound love story than a sermon . It is light , airy , important , and thoroughly entertaining ! ( This coming from a viewer who doesn't particularly care for Chick Flicks . . . . ! ) . Grady Harp


Text2: The palace in the mountain Wind is always blowing throughout the monastery the Servants of God nuns have inherited in a remote part of India . In accepting being in charge of the new place , Sister Clodagh will question her faith as she faces one of the greatest challenges of her life . Michael Powell , working with his usual collaborator , Emeric Pressburger , on the Rumer Godden's novel , created a film that stands the test of time . His achievement is even more incredible as he shot this film in an English studio . The film , brilliantly photographed by Jack Cardiff , one of the best men in the business , and a frequent ally of Mr . Powell , is one of the best pictures of the English cinema . The glorious Technicolor still looks great . "" Black Narcissus "" questions how some Christians , in this case , nuns of a religious order , can be so blind about things that deviate from what it deems is the right way . When the young General wants to be part of the school the nuns are creating , they reject him , yet , he asks about how would a God , made human in the form of Christ , would respond to his petition . Sister Clodagh is also put in a spot when she wants to get rid of the old man who day after day sits staring at the distant mountains . It's Mr . Dean who challenges her in asking how would her God deal with the old man . Sister Clodagh's past is revealed in flashbacks when she was a young woman and in love with a young man who wanted to emigrate to America and she wasn't ready to follow him . Also , Sister Ruth , who is a rebel , decides to abandon the order because she is in love with Mr . Dean . The highlight of the film is the scene in which Ruth begins applying the deep red lipstick , which makes quite a contrast with her beautiful reddish hair to the horror of Sister Clodagh , who clearly is not prepared for the desertion . There is also an undercurrent between Sister Clodagh and Mr . Dean , who one feels loves her . The nun is too loyal to the principles that made her take the vows . She realizes at the end that while she had the best intentions to transform the place , she is only a human being who suffers a defeat because of her surroundings . Deborah Kerr enjoyed one of the best triumphs of her career with the role of Sister Clodagh . She is seen as a young woman of great beauty and the austere nun she became later in her life . David Farrar is Mr . Dean , the Englishman who is now living in that remote part of India and knows the people well . Kathleen Byron makes an excellent contribution as the rebel Sister Ruth . Flora Robson plays the kind Sister Philippa . Jean Simmons appears as a cruel Indian girl , and Sabu has some interesting moments in the film . This is one of Mr . Powell's best movies in his influential film career . He was one of the most innovative film makers of his generation and it shows well in "" Black Narcissus "" .

Text2: Hard to sit through and not terribly good ending The only two problems with this movie are , as the one line summary states , the length and the ending . It's so long that unless you're very determined or very patient , you're not gonna sit through it to the end ( particularly not if you're watching the "" redux "" version which I was ( un ? ) lucky enough to see on TV ) . And the ending seems to suggest that Coppola had either run out of steam or simply didn't know how he should end it . As a war film , it's not particularly realistic , I guess , but more of a piece about the descent into madness that you experience under such dehumanizing circumstances . I found it interesting to see as such a film , but arguably not much else . . . I also found it interesting to recognize the actors , whom I , for the most part , hadn't seen in a film from , at least before the 80's . If any of this doesn't make sense , don't blame me . . . blame the fact that I'm writing this as I'm almost falling asleep after the movie . Now , let it be known , that I didn't pay attention to the entire thing ; I am neither a man of great patience nor determination ( well , not enough , anyway ) so I fell asleep once or twice through this film , and actually found myself awaking a few minutes after it had ended , and had to rewind it to catch the ending . Maybe that affected my judgment , maybe not ( it probably did ) . However , what I saw , I mostly liked . The acting is very good . The characters are well-written and nuanced . The action is well-done . The cinematography is very good . All in all , a very good film , if you have the patience and you're sufficiently interested in seeing this very well done piece of film , despite it's very long runtime ( maybe you would want to start with the original version , not the "" redux "" one I saw ) . I recommend it to just about anyone who really is interested in films and the media of movies . If you can sit through it , you probably should . Any Coppola fan should definitely experience this .

It isn't as good , but it is still a rather fun movie , though it is partly responsible for the let's add teenagers to every horror movie mentality . Roy Shieder returns as do a couple other characters though I do believe Michael grew up a bit to fast as he now appears about 16 or 17 when in the last one he looked maybe 10 or 11 . There may be another shark and the sheriff is the only one who believes there is . Though this is kind of annoying as people should be more willing to listen and worry less about the tourist season this time around . His sons go boating against his will and this leads to numerous shark attacks on a bunch of the kids who just had to boat for some reason .

Text2: A little bit of Grudge with a twist at the end . I mainly say it is sort of like Grudge is the hotel setting , or rather the haunted house scenario . This is the first of the after dark horror movies I have seen , and it was okay . Certainly better than other Japanese horror movies , but then it was not super special either . This one starts out with random people encountering ghosts and switches focus on a movie being made about a mass slaying at a hotel . The director is casting the part and selects one girl who just seems to strike him as different . We also get introduced to a student who has reoccurring dreams of said hotel . Her scenes seem to make little sense until the end where everything comes together rather nicely . You should figure out what is about to occur a bit before it happens though as it is telegraphed . Still you get your creepy ghost encounters , your somewhat interesting back story , and a bit of blood thrown in for good measure . I was not entirely happy with the ending , however I did like the way the movie progressed . I was a tad confused with the introduction of the student , however , another movie Kairo was worse with switching scenarios as this one was much easier to roll with than that one . After the revelation at the end though I thought it could have wrapped up quicker , but the look on the girl's face as she was totally freaking out was priceless . A tad creepy and interesting , nothing totally new , but it works .

Well , according to this biographical documentary , the producer Robert Evans has lived the life of an elevator , or maybe a toilet seat , with a couple of truly good highs - - "" Marathon Man , "" "" Chinatown , "" and others - - and some down periods involving cocaine , murder , and the loss of his beloved mansion in Woodland Hills . It's based on Evans ' own autobiography , and he narrates this doc . One might expect it to be filled with self justification , along the lines of , "" Yes , I brought suit and left him destitute but it was never about the money . "" Instead , he's pretty generous with praise for his pals and surprisingly "" understanding "" towards those who have brought him down . I put quotes around the word "" understanding "" because what I mean is that he doesn't heap his calumny upon his undoers . He leaves them pretty much blameless . But I don't believe for a moment he "" understands "" them , or if he does he's not being frank about it . His wife , Ali McGraw , didn't leave him for Steve McQueen because Evans stayed away from home too long while working . No respectable Hollywood producer would include such a hoary clich√© in a movie , unless John Wayne was the hero . How about , "" You're married to your job "" ? As Evans himself says in the narrative , "" I was never psychiatrically oriented . "" Evans seems to have a decent sense of humor about himself . He can poke fun at his early acting efforts . Once you've achieved great success , you're at liberty to do that . If Picasso had once been a bicycle repairman he might have joked about how bad he was . Yet the role distance is there , even though Evans ' narration undermines it with an excess of dramatization . There may always be tragedy just around the corner , but when you're hearing Evans tell you this in a voice that sounds like Rock Hudson's after chain smoking two packs of Gauloise , it remains less than convincing . The images reflect the volatility of his career , as does the music . At his height , living in his mansion , accepting awards , dating models , being interviewed while wearing a pair of tinted glasses whose color matches the tint of the pullover sweater he chose to wear that day , the cuts arrive con brio . Later , during the dark years of the late 1980s , the music turns mournful and melancholic , and there are dismal shots of Evans ' deserted swimming pool with maple leaves scattered across the surface like Evans ' wasted dreams , like his hundred-dollar bills . Some of it is not entirely believable . Depressed , Evans checks himself into some sort of sanatorium . He describes himself as being "" behind bars "" and his room is "" like a cell .

Text2: It ain't no masterpiece but I quite liked it . Puppet Master : The Legacy features a woman named Macclain ( Kate Orsini ) who has been hired to discover the secret behind puppet master Andre Toulon's ( played by actors Guy Rolfe & William Hickey who is in the film & not just the trailer as the IMDb would have you believe ) serum that manages to give life to his inanimate wooden puppets such as Blade , Tunneller , Six Shooter , Torch , Leech Woman , Pinhead & the cool Jester who each become living killing machines ready to protect their creator . Macclain breaks into Toulon's final resting place Bogeda Bay Inn where she finds Toulon's old friend Eric Weiss ( Jacob Witkin ) & threatens to torture & kill him unless he hands the secret over , as the two argue the truth about Andre Toulon is revealed as his entire life & the events surrounding his killer puppets are told . . . Directed by Charles Band under the pseudonym of Robert Talbot Puppet Master : The Legacy is the eighth & to date final film in the Puppet Master franchise that started with the excellent Puppet Master ( 1989 ) all those years ago , the series carried on with Puppet Master II ( 1991 ) , Puppet Master III : Toulon's Revenge ( 1991 ) , Puppet Master 4 ( 1993 ) , Puppet Master 5 : The Final Chapter ( 1994 ) , Curse of the Puppet Master ( 1998 ) & finally Retro Puppet Master ( 1999 ) before this instalment which went straight to video in ' 03 . The script by C . Courtney Joyner under the pseudonym of Gene Yarbrough tries to tell the tale of Andre Toulon in chronological order & make some sense out of it unlike the series as it stands at the moment & is basically an excuse to use as much footage from the previous seven Puppet Master films as possible , Puppet Master : The Legacy features clips from all of the previous entries . It would be interesting to know just how much original footage this contains , at a rough guess I'd say no more than fifteen minutes worth & that's being generous . The clips are reasonably well edited into into a new film , there are a few sudden jumps in logic & location , there are numerous occasions where character's just come & go within the space of a few minutes & it's a bit choppy as you would expect a 70 minute film made up from seven other films would be . I was going to start this comment by saying that I was a fan of the Puppet Master films but then I realised I have only seen the first two which I thought were both great , unfortunately judging by some of the footage from the other sequels the series obviously went downhill in a big way . I must admit I rather liked Puppet Master : The Legacy , they at least keep things moving , the clips used are good , I've only seen the first two so most of the footage was new to me anyway & rather surprisingly the twist ending was rather good , in fact I'd go as far as to say it was pretty clever ( hell , I doubt there are many instances in any Puppet Master film you could describe as clever ) & was a nice way to round things off . Director Band doesn't do anything as there's hardly any new footage here , what is here is reasonably well shot & there are some OK shots of the puppets . Various special effect & gore highlights throughout the series are present including face slashing , brain tunnelling , hook impaling , head bashing , shooting , burning , crotch drilling , throat slashing & Leech regurgitating . The puppets themselves are cool & probably the best bunch of killer toys ever to grace the silver screen ! The budget stretched to one room , some scientific lab equipment & the services of two actors , that's all there is to Puppet Master : The Legacy . These parts look fine even though the digital video used looks odd whenever it uses clips from the first two films which actually had budgets & were obviously shot on 35mm film . The distinctive , sinister & rather good Puppet Master theme music is used throughout . The acting was alright . Puppet Master : The Legacy isn't for everyone that's for sure as most of it is just footage taken from the other Puppet Master films . However I quite liked it as","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: More of the same ? Rush Hour 2 is pretty much a continuation of the first Rush Hour , which is not entirely a bad thing . Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are back in Chan's latest east meets west action comedy , which is another goofball comedy interspersed with what is meant to be a relatively serious crime story . Structurally , Rush Hour 2 is almost identical to the first Rush Hour , which is bad in its redundancy , but good in that it is almost as entertaining and amusing as the first one was . As is almost always the case with comedy sequels like this ( take the Austin Powers films as another perfect example ) , there is a lot of comedy from the original that is turned around or repeated in the sequel , either complementing on or feeding on the success of the original . One of Chris Tucker's lines from Part 1 ( ' Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth ? ! ' ) , for example , is now spoken by Jackie Chan , in an amusing scene that clearly makes good fun of Chan's English speaking skills . The astonishingly beautiful Zhang Ziyi , of Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon fame , plays the role of one of the villains in the Chinese gang , and although she is a welcome addition to the film , Rush Hour 2 is clearly below her level of acting skill and presence . There are some excellent fighting scenes with her , which is good because even Jackie Chan's fast paced and often hilarious fight scenes seem to have met their match with the usually faster and often better moves seen in Jet Li's films . One can only wonder how long it will be before the two are in a film together . Now THAT I'd like to see . With action comedies like this , there is an almost universal lack of anything new . They are almost always formulaic , and it was a relief to see that there was some innovation here . I've seen a lot of movies like this , but I have to admit that I've never seen one that involves a Ying Tao grenade taped inside someone's mouth . That was a pretty good scene . There are some more smart-ass lines from Tucker about black people and Chinese people ( ' Don't ever get in front of a black man while he's standing at a buffet line ! ' ) that could have and probably should have been left out , but as a whole , it's a fun movie . And as s the case with most slapstick comedies and Jackie Chan films , the outtakes at the end were some of the funniest parts of the movie .

Text2: Not playing with a full deck A cast made up of some fairly well known stars embarrass themselves with this highly disjointed ghost story . After 20 years , six childhood friends gather together for the funeral of a seventh . This in turn leads them on a path of remembrance and revelations . The movie did have promise , I will say that . Good locations and a good story or both sadly derail by bad editing , mediocre acting ( if this were a cast of newish actors I'd be apt to overlook that , but most of them are seasoned pros so I can't ) , and the film just raises more questions than it answers .

And I've seen many of the Masterpiece collection , first hand on the big screen . I am also a fan of Disney's non-Christian views and presentations of the world . They make you use that imagination , whether you want to , or not . They have a way of making a person face the harsh realities of life , and realize that life will go on ; regardless . They transport you , if only for a few moments , into another world , another place and / or another time . Not many movies really do that for you , but for me , Disney animations do . The good ones , that is . I've yet to see a sequel of a Disney movie that was worth a penny of my money or a moment of my time . But in all fairness , I have yet to see Cinderella 2 and Lion King 2 .

360,"Text1: A startlingly well made political love story , The American President succeeds hugely in the tremendously difficult task of being a good love story and a good political story at the same time . Michael Douglas , who is most well known for his enormous skill in playing stolid villains or regular men who become desperate because they manage to get themselves in way over their head , puts off these characteristics to play the part of the President of the United States , and he delivers a towering performance in this role . The story is based on the fact that President Andrew Shephard ( Douglas ) will soon be facing reelection , an election which may be compromised by the fact that he is developing a romantic interest in an envorinmental lobbyist named Sydney Ellen Wade ( played beautifully by Annette Bening ) . Matters are complicated by the fact that Shephard's wife died just before he was elected in the first place , and his cabinet members ( particularly Lewis Rothschild , played by Michael J . Fox ) are urgently trying to persuade him not to date during the election . One of the strange things about this movie is that it's kind of ironic that no one has really made a political film like this that centers around a romance involving the President . Indeed , watching a man as powerful as the U . S . President using his powers to flirt with someone that he has a crush on ( okay , that sounded pretty dumb . Maybe no one's done it before because it sounds ridiculous in writing ! ) , trying at the same time to persuade her that he really is the President . While it doesn't exactly SOUND like it would make the greatest film , this premise has resulted in the exceedingly superior romantic comedy that we see in The American President . The performances in the film are spectacular throughout , but it's actually the script that deserves even more attention than the actors ' performances , which is a rare distinction in a film . I think that the reason that The American President succeeds so well as a political film as well as a romantic comedy is that both elements are so realistically presented . I think it was Roger Ebert who praised The American President for approaching and handling real issues , such as gun control and the environment , instead of side-stepping this and trying to present a President who is not taking any certain stands on any certain issues that might cause the film's audience to like him or the movie less . The love story , one of the easiest things in the cinematic medium to completely screw up , is done brilliantly here , largely because of the occupations of the two subjects that it centers on as well as the excellent script . The movie has a nearly endless amount of comments to make about the American Presidency , the way that the public sees the office , and the restrictions that it places on its occupants . There is a pleasant irony between such things as President Shephard's ability to get Wade on the phone when she doesn't even have a phone of her own ( hey , I'm a poet and I didn't even realize it ? ) , but his complementary inability to even bring her to the house for a nice , innocent dinner . President Andrew Shephard is faced with the unfortunate task of trying to appease the American public , retain his position in the White House , convince Sydney Ellen Wade that he is who he says he is and that he is genuinely interested in her , and provide for his own romantic happiness , with the added conflict that if any one of them fails , all of the others are likely to fail as well . It's true that , this being a rather light-hearted romantic comedy , we already know how the film is going to end , but brilliant dialogue , a fascinating story , unusually interesting characters , and a tense political atmosphere prevent the material from getting boring just because we really already know how it's going to turn out in the end . Besides that , the romance in the film is so well done that that element alone makes it worth watching . There's a scene in the film when President Shephard and Wade are dancing in a crowded dinner hall , and she asks him what people are going to think about the whole situation , wondering who that woman is and why the President is dancing with her .

Text2: Is that you , Josephine ? Larry Semon made ' The Bakery ' during the phase of his career when he was trying to be Chaplinesque . We see him here in the titular bakery as the general dogsbody , just as Chaplin was employed in various workplaces in several of his Essanay and Keystone comedies ( notably ' Dough and Dynamite ' , also set in a bakery ) . And here , as in several of Semon's other comedies from this period , Oliver Hardy is cast as a villain very much in the mould of the characters played by Eric Campbell in Chaplin's comedies for Mutual . In ' The Bakery ' , Hardy is even wearing bushy eyebrows and a moustache that make him resemble Campbell in ' The Adventurer ' . For once , Semon makes a distinctive entrance . We first see his character only from below the waist , the upper half of his body concealed beneath the stack of parcels he's carrying . Only after he stumbles through a trap door do we see his face : one of the most naturally comic faces in all of silent films . Too bad that Semon's comedic inventiveness never caught up with his appearance . Some of Chaplin's short comedies got a great deal of comic mileage out of one unusual prop ; notably the escalator in ' The Floorwalker ' . In ' The Bakery ' , Semon gets impressive mileage out of a rotating pillar of shelves , each shelf containing a different cake . Semon spins the pillar so that its protruding sign spins round and hits Hardy in the back of the head . Then Hardy chases Semon round the pillar , prompting Semon to take the natural ( and very Chaplin-like ) lurk of riding the pillar while it revolves , so that he can relax while Hardy pursues him . There's even a Chaplinesque plot line here , with a shortage in the bakery's books . I expected Hardy , as the villain , to be the culprit here . . . and was surprised when things went otherwise . Elsewhere , there's a Prohibition gag involving a bottle labelled ' Home Brew ' . ( Which makes as much sense as a bag of cocaine marked ' Cocaine ' . ) I'll give a good-sport award to actress Eva Thatcher for a sequence in which a mouse climbs into her clothing ; too bad the routine isn't funny . The real mystery of this Semon short is the brief but virtuoso performance by a trained monkey . This monkey looks exactly like Josephine , the monkey who gave such remarkable performances in Harold Lloyd's ' The Kid Brother ' and Buster Keaton's ' The Cameraman ' . But those movies were six and seven years after ' The Bakery ' . . . is it possible that Josephine's movie career lasted for so long ? I'm absolutely certain that this is the same monkey ; I wish I could verify it . ' The Bakery ' is well above Larry Semon's average , largely due to the fact that for most of its length he's emulating Chaplin's brand of comedy . Unfortunately , by the end of this short movie , Larry Semon has reverted to his true nature , and we get one of those wildly implausible Semon gag sequences : this one involving a ladder that manages to tip its occupants into ladies ' bathrooms and other inconvenient places , in a manner that's too implausible to be funny . There's too much cakery fakery in ' The Bakery ' , but at least it's concentrated into the last 300 feet or so of this short movie . I'll rate ' The Bakery ' , much higher than I'd usually rate a Semon film .

361,"Text1: A Tough Film to Review Commenting on FACTOTUM , a film based both on Charles Bukowski's novel of the same name and simultaneously an autobiography of a strange writer , is a difficult task . If director Bent Hamer and screenwriters Jim Stark and Hamer were striving to create the milieu in which the story of Bukowski's alcohol-soaked , lowlife women lover life as a wannabe poet and writer , a life of depression and failure and striving to be something other than a misfit , then they have succeeded admirably . If that is the goal then the movie deserves five stars . Sadly , the monochromatic delivery of lines , of lack of movement , of repetitive failures , and of the inordinately boring voice over delivered in a monotone makes staying with this film almost impossible . Matt Dillon is Henry Chinaski ( read Charles Bukowski ) , a man who writes when he is barely sober from his 24 hour a day drinking , submitting stories to magazines and editors . But his main concern is making just enough money for the next bottle of booze . He hooks up with some equally sad women - alcoholic Jan ( Lili Taylor in her usual fine characterization ability ) and alcoholic Laura ( the always fine Marisa Tomei ) - and some transient buddies whom he meets at his various nothing jobs , attracting the attention at times of guys who will join him in a bookie racket , but always struggling with employers who do not tolerate his bellicose and drunken behavior . Even his parents throw him out . He is a sad sack of a man who finally gets a story accepted by Black Sparrow Press , seemingly the purpose of dragging us through this depressing 94 minutes of a film . Matt Dillon's performance has been praised by some and he does seem to embody Henry Chinaski's dreary soul , but the performance ( especially the boring voice over portion ) is so flatline that it is difficult to care for him at all . Yes , Bukowski wrote and lived like this and for Bukowski fans the movie will satisfy . For others this film is just too interminably dreary and long to tolerate for a second viewing . Grady Harp


Text2: M√©nage a Trois , but on whose terms ? If three can play at love , and if that love is an equilateral triangle , then each of the three is equally responsible for the ramifications . Were that the case in this little low budget Indie film BOOK OF LOVE the story would have more resonance . But art imitates life and life is full of contradictions and double standards and that is what seems to writer / director Alan Brown seems out to show us . David ( Simon Baker ) is a popular history teacher in a private girl's school in New Jersey and is blissfully married to Elaine ( Frances O'Connor ) who is an Events Planner and thrives on her time with her husband , wanting to delay having children for ' at least ten years ' in lieu of an exciting marital sex life . Into this radiantly alive couple's life enters a young fifteen-year-old highschool student and swimmer Chet ( Gregory Smith ) who happens to meet them in an ice cream parlour and immediately feels a warmth for the two of them . The feeling is mutual , especially and David and Elaine learn that Chet has no strong family ties , has never even been into Manhattan much less to Disney World , a place Chet covets . David and Elaine invite Chet into their home and lives , dining with him , taking him to a club in Manhattan ( a place where Elaine takes the stage to sing with her lesbian friend entertainer ) , involving him in talks about Cambodian history and philosophy , etc . As an aside , their lesbian couple friends approach David to be the sperm donor for a child and Elaine and David agree to their request . David , Elaine and Chet appear to be a most happy trio until Chet makes physical advances to Elaine , advances which Elaine initially gently rebuffs but simultaneously feels awakened sensual responses to this young virginal lad . Chet finds it difficult to separate his love for the couple and his corporeal desires and ultimately Chet and Elaine have a sexual encounter . Elaine confesses her indiscretion to David , allows him his initial pain , and then is surprised at David's forgiveness and immediate physical response to her . Chet comes to David's office , apologizes for the event , and David again surprises Chet with his forgiveness and his suggestion that the trio continue with David's promised trip for the three of them to Disney World . While on the outing to Disney World David invites Chet into the hotel room for a drink and a demonstration of Chet's diving skills , a set up for a physical encounter on the floor . Elaine enters the room , sees the encounter as a sexual one , frightens Chet who stabs David in a scuffle , and the Disney World trip ends in disaster . It is the working out of the new twist on the triangle that furnishes the rest of the film and the final results of the trio's relationship is surprising and stretches the limits of credibility . The problem member of this m√©nage a trois is Elaine , a woman who allows herself to become sexually involved with Chet , but when she believes David is likewise sexually involved with the lad she is unable to cope . It seems like the woman of the triangle determines the rules and that is where many will feel this story is more tragic . O'Connor is a fine English / Australian actress and gives a top-flight performance . Simon Baker is another Australian ( Tasmanian ) actor who has a great deal of depth and strong screen presence . Gregory Smith is a young Canadian actor who shows tremendous promise . Together the three give fine ensemble acting that makes this unlikely trio credibility and engages our empathy . There is a lot of talent in this little film and for a first movie writer / director Alan Brown gives notice of a talent to watch . In time some of the side indulgences included in this film will be less intrusive and more insightfully utilized . But on the whole this is a successful film worth watching . Grady Harp , April 05

362,"Text1: A movie that means well , but is as overbearing as a rehab cult member Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature , and not because it's not without trying . . . Actually , it is . It's a shamble all the more because it's writer / director / technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film . Sometimes a first time filmmaker , full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students , goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed , unsure , and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story , the extremely personal side , gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story . Gaglia , who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their "" patients "" with crazy group scare tactics , psychological mind-f sessions that could go on for days , and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most Nazis cringe , escaped finally when he was 15 . I'm glad he got out , though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film-making skills , if only for a couple of days , to learn things like , say , structure , proper lighting , fluid camera movement , subtlety with actors , and other basics that are perpetually lost here . It's all the more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public ( there was recently a Newsweek article referring to a similar AA cult-rehab ) . Many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas . This is an ever-nagging sensation throughout Over the GW , where it almost feels like Gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesn't know how to communicate it properly through his characters . The character that one would think is closest to him , Bronx teen Tony Serra ( Gallagher ) , who is taken by his mother to a rehab in New Jersey , would be closest to Gaglia , is actually much more of a one-dimensional being , where there is very little back-story ( we see a brief freak-out , in black and white , in his old home ) and little connection to his mother ( Moriarty ) , who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another . But there is a story to go with his two-year crisis , I guess . Right off the bat things get rough ( a nude cavity search in the first five minutes ) , and soon it's clear that instead of medical care it's more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect , where the head doctor Hiller ( Insinnia ) is a total over-controlling loon . But soon Tony's sister Sofia ( Donohue ) gets thrown in to the program , and as opposed to Tony's repeated moments of outrage and supposed non-compliance , she goes head-on through the whacked-out three step program and once released becoming a runaway . At times there are bits in this fractured nightmare , where there's one woman , a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she's become a prisoner not allowed to leave , and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them , that do contain some raw power , very brief glimpses of Gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama . But these are moments few and far between . It's not just the unsuccessful characters , who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical D . A . R . E . rip-offs ( maybe some of them , like an angry black youth , the passive-aggressive counselors , or even Serra's older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program , would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them ) . It's that Gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny $30 , 000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through . He over-uses tints , mostly with a shade that looks urine-coated ) , he jiggles his hand-held DVX camera as if it's supposed to be intense ala City of God ,

Brief plot summary goes as this : a prep kid needs money so he takes a job looking after a blind old guy who lives in a cottage with his family . If that was it , this movie wouldn't have even gotten off the ground , but then something interesting happens : the old guy is quite the classic ( bleep ) . And this Lieutenant Colonel is played by Al Pacino in the ' bravado ' style of his abilities , his abilities being of his instincts , even if it is not at all one of his best performances . Too much of it is over-emphasis , close to being not even a complete person , even in the strongest moments . It's almost as if the Oscar to Pacino was more for his career up till then , not even for this film necessarily . Slade leads the young man ( Chris O'Donnel ) on a coming of age odyssey in NYC . If you take this part of the film ( like taking the entire 90 minutes of Tom Hanks on Cast Away island and sea ) , you have something quite intriguing at times , but the film also has some un-needed stuff left over from preppie-school message-movie land , and it doesn't work at all .

364,"Text1: Kind of a Medieval "" Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf "" Peter O'Toole is Henry II , a true "" Lion in Winter "" in this 1968 film version of the play by James Goldman and also starring Katharine Hepburn , Anthony Hopkins , Timothy Dalton , Nigel Terry , Jane Merrow and John Castle . On Broadway , the roles of Henry and Eleanor were played by Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris . The casting director for the Broadway production commented that the original auditions , before Preston and Harris injected the spice and humor into the dialogue , were heavy going , the delivery of the actors very , very serious . Imagine this movie with no spark , no sarcasm , no wry humor injected into the lines , and you've got yourself a real nightmare . Fortunately , it's not the case . Though the story takes dramatic license with the truth - for instance , there was no Christmas gathering of the actual family in 1183 , but there was in 1182 - the depiction of the family's infighting , considering how everything turned out , is probably quite correct . King Henry II wants to name his successor and brings his family together . This includes his imprisoned wife , Eleanor of Quitaine ( Hepburn ) , his mistress , Princess Alais ( Merrow ) , and his three sons - Richard ( Hopkins ) , Geoffrey ( Castle ) and John ( Terry ) , and Alais ' brother , King Philip of France ( Dalton ) . Everybody makes deals they don't intend to make good , promises they don't plan to keep , and alliances they don't want in order to secure the throne either , in the sons ' cases , for themselves , or in Eleanor and Henry's cases , for someone else . To say that Henry and Eleanor have a volatile relationship is a tremendous understatement , and the dialogue is an incredible roller-coaster ride that's never boring . One wonders if an audience would sit through such a film today . If not , it's a pity , because it's so brilliant . Watching O'Toole and Hepburn sparring - sometimes so cruelly and bitterly that it's devastating - is addictive . You can't turn away from it . Hepburn shows us immediately by subtle actions - a quick expression that's just as quickly covered up , a slight hesitation in movement or speech - that no matter what her words say , she worships Henry still . For Henry , she is the most challenging and exciting woman he has ever known - and because of the volatility of their relationship , they can't survive together . Talk about being able to push each other's buttons - with Henry , it's whether or not Eleanor slept with his father ; with Eleanor , it's his desire to marry Alais and divorce her . O'Toole takes the title of the film literally , and he indeed roars like an old lion . A powerful and overt actor , Henry II , which he played twice , is one of his greatest roles and this performance perhaps his best . Handsome , sexy , angry and wild , he holds the screen magnificently . For me this is Hepburn's best role . Her Eleanor is beautiful , dignified , sensitive and determined , easily wounded by Henry , though she tries not to show it . Henry II lived another 6 years , during which time Eleanor remained imprisoned by him , although she enjoyed more freedom and actually occasionally traveled with Henry . Henry was succeeded by Richard and then , because Richard had no heirs , by John . Eleanor spent her last years as a nun and , no surprise , outlived all of her children except for King John and Queen Leonora . Both Henry and Eleanor will live forever in "" The Lion in Winter . "" Imagine a movie with such superstars that Anthony Hopkins has a supporting role - thus was the case in 1968 when the young Hopkins played Richard , a closet homosexual who has had an affair with Philip of France . ( "" Oh , Richard , "" Eleanor says as she sends him to make a deal with Philip , "" promise him ANYTHING . "" ) History is quite divided over whether or not Richard was actually gay , but some writings definitely indicate that he was . Hopkins is brilliant as a tough and even cruel man who has a very sensitive side that can be gotten to by his mother . The rest of the acting is uniformly excellent . One of the

After the rather childish Merlin and the just plain weird Excalibur I was pleased that this film was more grown-up and with better characters who you can actually connect with . I've not seen Julianna Margulies in anything else aside from Out for Justice ( yay ! ) and Ghost Ship . But damn , she was totally gorgeous as Morgaine , a character previously portrayed as a villain . Though I have the book by Marion Zimmer Bradley , I have not yet read it ( I'll get round to it ) . But I can tell you now that her version of events tells it from the point of view of the women and how their conspiring and unloyalty brought about the end of Camelot . For a legend with so many incarnations this angle was quite refreshing . It's far from a woman's film though . It does , however , a lot of love story in it . But it's the kind of love story where you know what the characters are thinking and what they feel rather than just something rudely stapled on to appeal to the women . Mists of Avalon is also wonderfully shot and has many scenes of unique atmosphere . All of this , obviously , is backed up by Lee Holdridge's utterly beautiful score . A dozen great themes and moods played out to various emotions . Definitely one of the best scores ever , methinks . Like I have said , there are loads of movies to choose from regarding this legend . But Mists of Avalon is the best I have seen so far . So I recommend that you choose this ' un . The DVD is in great-looking 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound . Some slight extras , including deleted scenes , are on there too .

366,"Text1: Cheesy , lame , but still a lot of fun Howard the Duck is a film that I grew up with , I was only a 1 year old when it was released , but my mom and I would watch it together all the time . I think that's the reason why this movie is just special to me . But still I watch this movie and honestly it's not as bad as most people exaggerate it to be , granted it's not Citizen Kane , but it's still awesome to watch . I think people take the movie too seriously , first off look at the title , if you're expecting a duck to deliver an Oscar worth performance , get your head checked , second people make fun of the "" flirting "" between the duck and Lea Thompson , which was meant to be a joke , not real . Third , the ending , people make fun of it and it's being over the top , I personally found it to be so funny and still a ton of fun to watch , how could you not get a kick out of Jeffrey Jones ' performance ? He was awesome ! If you wanna know what the movie is about , read on before you see the movie so you can get a good idea and judge for yourself . The film begins late at night in "" Duckworld , "" which is a version of planet Earth , but with talking ducks living there in place of human beings . As Howard tries to relax , his armchair begins to vibrate violently , and Howard and the chair are promptly yanked through outer-space , all the way to Cleveland on planet Earth . After ending up in an oil drum , Howard hears a fight involving a woman and two thugs pretending to be her fans . Howard uses his skills of "" Quack Fu "" to defend her . Intimidated by a talking duck , the thugs scamper . The woman , Beverly , thanks Howard and , feeling sorry for him because he has no warm and dry place to sleep , invites him to her apartment . The next day , Beverly takes Howard to see Phil Blumburtt , who she believes is a scientist that can help Howard get back to Duckworld . It turns out Phil is actually a janitor at a museum and Howard , infuriated with Phil's charade . A few days later , Dr . Walter Jenning , and Larry who explain to Howard that they were doing a routine procedure at the lab , only for the experiment to go out of control , causing the laser to hit Howard's planet instead . Howard suggests he can be sent back to Duckworld if the laser can be put into reverse . He is taken to the Dynatechnics lab alongside Beverly , only to find out on arrival that the laser is seriously damaged due to another explosion . The explosion brings down a "" Dark Overlord "" who is not seen by the audience at the time , and takes over Jenning's body . Howard and Beverly see Dr . Jenning , but he is in the process of being taken over by the Dark Overlord . With Howard and Beverly both unaware of this , they escape in Jenning's car onto the freeway with him driving dangerously due to his worsening possession . They stop outside a diner just before he is fully taken over . Inside the Diner , the Overlord explains his attempts to call forth his fellow aliens from the Nexus of Sominus so that they may take over the world . Honestly , yeah the plot is a bit much to grasp , but cut the movie some slack , it's about a duck for goodness ' sake ! For me , it still makes me laugh and I have a ton of fun watching it . I loved seeing Tim Robbins and Howard trying to get to the factory to destroy Jeffrey Jones before he could take over the world , Tim was absolutely hilarious ! Yes there are a few things about this movie that are over the top but I still think that this movie is just mindless entertainment . Hey how many movies do we have where a duck saves Planet Earth ? Hmm , I guess this is the only one ; but give the movie a fair chance , it's a cute one .


Text2: Another James Bond Classic to remember James Bond in Dr . No , from what I understand this was the debut of the 007 films or at least one of the first . I have to say that I really enjoyed Dr . No . Maybe even a little better than Goldfinger . Again , I've said before , I'm enjoying this in the fact that I'm getting more Austin Power jokes . Not to mention finally I know where Dr . Evil comes from . Dr . No is the new villain and he has an island where he is killing everyone who steps on it and plans for world domination .

367,"Text1: Letting go of fear doesn't work for those around us SPOILERS Max Kline , Jeff Bridges , not only survived a deadly plane crash that cost the lives of some 200 passengers he also saved about a dozen people from that burning inferno . Max becomes a hero in the eyes of those that he saved as well as the news media . Max for some strange reason seemed to walk away from it all as if nothing happened which to many , including the FBI , seemed weird and strange . The airline sends a trauma expert Dr . Pearlman , John Turturro , to examine Max as well as the other survivors to see if their all right and if not what treatment they would need . The movie "" Fearless "" concentrates on two survivors and one wife of a survivor who are in some way connected to each other . Because of the tragedy . Max's friend and architect partner Jeff Gordon , John DeLancie , was killed in the crash and left a wife Nan , Deirdre O'Connell , with two little children . Jeff greedily switched the tickets that Max gave him for the flight for cheaper ones that didn't have life insurance to cover himself . Carla Rodrigo , Rosie Perez , who also survived the crash , thanks to Max , lost her little boy when he fell out of her hands and was killed . This made Carla fall into a deep depression by holding herself responsible for his death . Max's change of life after the crash comes into conflict in dealing with the realities of both Carla and Nan as well as his wife Laura , Isabella Rosselini , in getting his life back to normal . Max soon develops a fearless attitude toward death and during the movie risks his life as if he were tempting death to see somehow that if he's really dead or not . Carla is the only one who seems to bring Max back to the real world with her depression over her sons death in the crash . That makes Max go out of his way to show her that she wasn't responsible . Having Carla her sit in his car one evening and having Carla hold a tool box , as if it were her baby boy , Max then crash the car full-force into a brick wall ! This was to show her that she couldn't have held on to her child to save him from the plane crash : a bit insane but it worked in curing Carla of her severe guilt feelings . The car crash also settled Max's not wanting to lie about Jeff's death . Jeff's lawyer Brillstein , Tom Hulce , wanted Max to lie about the circumstances of Jeff's death to get a bigger settlement . Now Max doesn't have to testify by showing that he became suicidal because of the plane crash and thus lost control of his mental faculties . It was shown in the movie , after Max survived the plane crash , that everything that Max did he seemed to be guided by some invisible force . Like the one which had Max lead those survivors of the plane crash to safety . This unseen force made those who thought that Max was a bit strange and odd see that he was in some way a changed but better person because of it . The end of the film seemed a bit confusing but thinking about everything else in the movie that lead up to it did somehow make sense . Max , with his wife present , picks up a strawberry from Nan's lawyers batch of gifts that he had and munches on it which seems to poison and kill him . It was explained early in the movie that Max had a deadly allergic reaction to strawberries since he was a child . With everyone thinking that he's dead Max miraculously comes back to life with his wife happily holding and kissing him . We've seen earlier in the movie Max eating strawberries , again tempting death , with nothing happening to him ! So why then should anything like him possibly dying from eating the strawberries happen to him now when it didn't happen before in the movie ? Was it that strange force or was it Max himself in getting him and his wife Laura back together since their strained marriage , due to Max's relationship with Carla after the plane crash , which had him and his wife on the verge of separating and divorcing ! Deep and interesting movie about how facing death in the present and surviving changes us for the better in

Text2: Slick Electioneering Propaganda This is as slick a piece of campaign film as ever came out of Hollywood - - barring , of course , the anti-Upton Sinclair stuff turned out as newsreels in the 1930s during his campaign for governor of California . President Coolidge is presented as a simple man of the people who helps his cousin with the haying when he is in the neighborhood , works in the building he was born in and lives in the same house his father was born in : just another fellow like you and me . He runs the nation just about as well as we could . Except they don't even use a pronoun , or a name . Surely when someone was reading this off the screen , someone would ask "" Who is that ?

Text2: well the first half was enjoyable . . . . . 80's metal band Whitesnake's sultry siren Tawny Kitaen is extremely lucky in some ways ( ie . she dated OJ Simpson and lived to tell the tale ) . but decidedly unlucky in deciding this as her first feature film . Kitaen plays the titular role of Gwendoline who , with some help , is trying to find her father and a rare butterfly . While the first half of this film is so bad , it's good in a campy culty way , humorously enough the second half , when they actually find the girl tribe of the Yik Yak is when it takes a nosedive and becomes tedious . You'd think it would only get better by injecting a truckload of topless women , but you'd be wrong . As it's definitely not .

I'd STILL watch it a million times more than that "" Avacado Women in the Jungle of Death "" crap fest .

370,"Text1: All Men Are Brutes Susan Sarandon is a delight as always , with her exopthalmia and perky nose . Geena Davis , in her first big role since her appearance in "" The Accidental Tourist "" is also good , and yummy in a toothy sort of way . The movie is fun to watch but it's silly in a desperate kind of way , slapping each other's palms and going "" Wheee ! "" as they sail off together into the Grand Canyon . ( The photography is sunny and splendid . ) More important than the performances , more important than the photography , more important than anything else about the film is that it is a perfect illustration of a sociological point - - It is impossible to have bonding without an enemy . People not only bond WITH one another but AGAINST others . ( Anyone into social psychology should check out Muzafer Sherrif's classic "" Robber's Cave "" experiment before seeing this flick . ) That's why the president's hooper rating always soars after a national crisis such as a terrorist attack . Suddenly our bonds with each other as "" Americans "" become more important than internal differences in regional or political viewpoints . This principle goes unspoken in the film . How could it possibly be articulated ? We would find ourselves sleeping with the enemy . But the message is there , covert as it is . There isn't a truly sympathetic male in the movie . Harvey Keitel is a relatively benign authority figure , but he is distant and powerless to do do anything other than his duty , which is evidently to put them in a position where they feel they need to turn into part of the scenery . Michael Madsen tries to be understanding and helpful but - - MICHAEL MADSEN ? ( How about Timothy Carey ? ) His looks , his demeanor , lightly rasping voice , his smoking , belie his dialogue . We recognize the face of the beast when we see it . That's why Costa-Gavras was nailed by critics for casting the sympathetic looking Yves Montand as a CIA-sponsored torture instructor in "" State of Siege "" . The husband is a stereotypical idiotic patriarchal male . A hitch-hiker , smooth and apologetic and cute , turns out to be a thieving moral idiot when his glands are satisfied . A would-be rapist is a greasy gargoyle . A truck driver is something out of the barroom scene in "" Star Wars . "" The flaw lies not so much in the movie , which is filled with breezy chatter and is exhilarating , and not in the script either . The deeply disturbing aspect of this motion-picture event is the audience's and the critic's response to it . What - - ultimately - - is there to applaud about a movie that tells us that the two genders are by nature or by fate enemies of one another . That one is oppressed and exploited by the other ? And that the resolution of the conflict lies not in negotiation but suicide ? If that were true , there would be no audience around to clap when Thelma and Louise do their joint nosedive . Yes , it has brio and leaves you feeling amused and happy most of the time , but it leaves a sour taste afterward . In the end this is a tragedy , not the comedy it was meant to be .


Text2: Politically correct , racist and dumb . I used to really like "" The Patriot . "" Unfortunately , I watched it again recently and found myself quite disappointed . It's too silly , really . The ending , for example , is a hoot ( somehow I had overlooked it countless times before ) . The Brits are all these vicious , stupid dogs and the Americans are smarter , better , stronger , and cooler . It's extremely politically correct , so much so that it's almost laughable . In one corner there's the stereotypical black freedom fighter . In the other , the Evil Brit . And in yet another corner , the Man Who's Lost His Wife and Doesn't Want to Fight Because He's a Father and Has Learned to Value Human Life Despite His Violent Past ( similar characters exist in every movie ever made , just about ) . There's an exchange of dialogue that goes like this , during a fight : ( Before fighting the boss on level eight - err , I mean the British ) : White Racist : You're a free man , now . Black Man : I'm here on my own accord , now . White Racist : I am honored to be fighting alongside you . Truly honored . Then the black man smiles warmly . It needn't be pointed out that this is awful stuff , but just for the sake of pointing it out to you : This is awful stuff , folks . Later , during a retreat , Mel Gibson's character grabs the American flag , hauls it forward , yells "" No retreat ! "" and waves it in the air . The black man looks on fondly . The point of all this is clear but it's way too heavy-handed and stupid . It's subtlety on the level of that scene in "" Cool Hand Luke "" ( the only problem I have with the movie ) where Paul Newman complains he just sees a lot of guys laying down rules . The exposition is unnecessary , and in both cases it ruins the flow of the scene . So , to summarize : The movie is politically correct ( it was originally going to be based on the Swamp Fox but they weren't allowed to show a hero mistreating his slaves , as the Swamp Fox did ) and racist . It's anti-British , which I don't really have a problem with because every movie needs a villain , but it's a bit too much . A couple years ago I considered this one of the best war films of all-time . Now , I see a pop culture reworking of a historical period , transformed by the director of "" Godzilla "" and "" The Day After Tomorrow "" into a silly , poorly-acted ( apart from Gibson , who I'll always enjoy in film ) , stereotypical jumble of the biggest clich√©s in the book .

371,"Text1: A very average television show in the vein of "" Full House "" Joey , Matt and Andy are three brothers living in Philly in a building above a car garage where they work . The garage used to be owned by their father , but he has recently passed away , leaving the three boys ( one an adult , one a high-schooler and a middle-schooler ) to live with their mother . Every episode of the show would somehow involve a moment where the oldest brother gets in a tizzy and throws a fit , then later apologizes and acknowledges that he still is upset about his father's death . This tension resurfaces in every episode - and gets really old . Obviously his father's death is the foundation of the plot for the show , but that doesn't mean the entire narrative needs to somehow center around this . The supporting cast is rather weak - the other two Lawrence brothers ( they're all brothers in real life ) decrease in acting ability by age , the youngest becoming nothing more than the equivalent of a Mary-Kate / Ashley Olsen "" cute "" gimmick , and there is of course the comedic role given to a troublesome co-worker at the garage - an overweight slob named Lloyd who eats .

Text2: From the people who gave you St . Elsewhere TATTINGERS is an example of the hit and miss aspect of production success in television . The writers and staff who created the excellent medical show ST . ELSEWHERE decided to branch out and make this similar comedy / drama about a famous New York City restaurant called TATTINGERS . It was supposed to be on par with Le Cirq or "" 21 "" , and it was owned by Nick Tattinger ( Stephen Collins ) , who is divorced from his wife Hillary ( Blythe Danner ) . They have two daughters . Part of the plot , by the way , is not described in the description that was given on the thread . Nick was shot and seriously wounded when he found some local drug dealer trying to sell drugs to his older daughter . He knocked the guy down , and started taking the girl home , when the drug dealer recovers , pulls out a gun , and shoots Nick . At the time the show began , Nick has recovered , but the dealer has gotten out of prison , and he is constantly harassing Nick and his staff , causing food deliveries to be sidetracked or delayed or stolen , and also occasionally invading the precincts of the restaurant . Now that point alone shows you a problem with the show's scripts . On ST . ELSEWHERE , the writers frequently showed their disillusion with the American justice system by having criminals get early release , or not get caught or convicted , or by having people we sympathize with who commit crimes and go to prison as a result . They obviously took this feeling into TATTINGERS , but went too far . In the real world , if this drug dealer was harassing his shooting Victim and his restaurant ( as he is ) it would likely lead to the dealer returning to prison . In the super real world , Nick would probably have the drug dealer dealt with in a final method that would not bear looking into by the police . Instead they had this harassment involved with the shows for too long . It made no sense at all . But what was far worse was the engine that geared up for every episode's plot . Instead of trying to build stories around the workings of the staff , their hopes and dreams , and their private lives , the writers quickly tried to use a rather hackneyed plot idea again and again and again . Nick claims ( in the first episode ) that he has many friends , and frequently finds himself doing favors for people . Well , that happens - but not with the idiotic frequency that it happens to Nick . It is reminiscent of two episodes ( at least ) on M . A . S . H . , where Hawkeye has some simple problem to cure and has to arrange ( or try to arrange ) half-a-dozen or so exchanges of favors before he can get that new boot he needs , or get that furlough set up or whatever . The episodes on M . A . S . H . that used this became so predictable that they are among the least funny of that series . Here it was done weekly as the plot . And it was less than successful here to . In real life , somebody who found his friends so frequently demanding so much help with "" favors "" would wonder if it would make sense to find a new set of friends . There were some interesting moments on the show . The aged George Abbott and Garson Kanin appeared in one episode as themselves , proclaiming they were TATTINGERS regulars . In another episode there was a cute joke , about a demanding customer who was coming named Mr . Wilkes . When he showed up , the maitre'd said , "" Where is Mr . Wilkes ' booth ? "" There was even a reference to the more successful ST . ELSEWHERE . An actor who played a doctor on ST . ELSEWHERE ( who had died of a heart attack on that show ) appeared as a lawyer in an episode of TATTINGERS . He is complaining about his recent problems , mostly about his cases , and then adds , "" And my favorite cousin Eliott just dropped dead at the hospital he worked at in Boston ! "" .

The all-star comedic cast alone draws you to the movie , much less the jokes themselves . But let me tell you , the jokes did not fall flat at all . I don't know how many times I laughed , but it was countless . Unlike most comedies , RAT RACE delivers the whole way through , then has a HUGE comedy scene during an already funny movie ( a few in particular among many , such as the airport scene , the helicopter scene , The Lucy Bus and the Hitler scene . ) Basically a remake of the 1969 film IT'S A MAD , MAD , MAD , MAD , WORLD , the plot of the movie is a little different , and goes a little something like this : A billionaire tycoon named Donald Sinclair ( Cleese ) puts gold coins inside 6 slot machines in his hotel , to draw people on a game of his to be the first to get to Mexico City , and find a million dollars stored in a locker at a train station . First one there , wins it all . We find that a football referee ( Gooding ) who has made the worst call on a play in history , two money seeking brothers ( GREEN ) looking to sue the hotel , a mother ( Goldberg ) just reunited with her daughter she gave away years ago , a man taking his family on their first vacation in years ( Lovitz ) , an uptight young man ( Breckin Myer ) who finally takes a risk gambling one coin into a slot machine , and last but definitely not least a Frenchman named Enrico Polini ( Atkinson ) all find a coin . After being let in on Sinclair's game , at first they all say they won't go after the money . Then it begins . ALL of them rush away after the money , except Breckin Meyer's character , which leaves to take a flight home . On the way however , he meets a young female helicopter pilot ( AMY SMART ) who agrees to fly him to Mexico City , unaware of the little gamble . Later she is let in on the secret however , and she agrees to head to Mexico with him anyway . All the characters are completely loveable , especially Atkinson's . There're some famous cameos in this film as well , to name two are Kathy Bates and the band Smash mouth . There're a lot of interesting things about this film . One , is that it's the first to have two African-American actors in one movie together . Two , the character progression and introduction is done so well , it's incredible . It's truly amazing how good a comedy CAN be , and this is a good reference to look at if you're filming comedy . Another thing this comedy has , is the fact that while you're rooting for everyone , you wouldn't REALLY care if your character doesn't get the million . That's just the way the movie goes . And the end , unlike most comedies is truly great , and while a bit predictable what action the characters will take , we never guess HOW they do . If it's Donald Sinclair betting on who's going to throw up first , to your favorite characters doing wild and zany things , RAT RACE proves , it's truly a MAD , MAD , MAD , MAD WORLD , full of laughter and other great things , too many of which to wrap up in this comment !

Text2: One of the best of the ' last stand ' movies . In addition to Bataan being one of the finest World War II films ever done , it also marked the final transformation of Robert Taylor from romantic leading man to tough action star . After this one Taylor , NEVER got cast in any powder puff roles . He's a tough , believable army sergeant who's in command of a squad that's been cobbled together from remnants of other squads and given a suicide rear guard mission to hold off the Japanese from taking and crossing a key bridge . Some of the other men of his squad are Lloyd Nolan , Thomas Mitchell , Robert Walker , Barry Nelson , Desi Arnaz . There's an army pilot with a plane to be repaired played by George Murphy and when Captain Lee Bowman is killed Taylor is in command . So they hold the Japanese off , the Battle of Bataan in microcosm , hoping for aid that never came because the United States had no aid to give at that point . In the tradition of The Alamo , they all go down , one at a time . Of the cast I'd single out Lloyd Nolan and Desi Arnaz . Nolan is another army veteran , a hardbitten hardcase almost a mirror image of Taylor . Their scenes have some real bite to them . But Lloyd Nolan was never bad in anything he ever did . Desi Arnaz is quite a revelation . His accent is pretty thick , he never got to be a Latin Lover leading man like Fernando Lamas or Ricardo Montalban did . In fact that accent was part of his whole shtick with his wife later on in I Love Lucy . But Arnaz shows her he was capable of being far more than the patient but sometimes exasperated Ricky Ricardo . Too bad he never got more opportunities like Bataan . No derring do heroics in Bataan . These are ordinary people of the greatest generation doing a job that had to be done .

373,"Text1: A Magical Bon-Bon from Michel Gondry The French have a way with films that tinker with reality , fantasy , illusions , and delusions and the result of those traits have produced some of the most exciting and avant garde films ever made . Michel Gondry has inherited the mantle from Cocteau , Resnais , etc and runs with it in this charming little diversion of a film THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP . Gondry is primarily a visual artist and tells his stories in a visual manner , but that is not to say his stories are superficial or trivial : he has a preoccupation with the thin line between reality and non-reality , between dream and diurnal creativity , and it is this space that occupies his mind , his pen , his camera , and his mission in this little tale . St√©phane Miroux ( the enormously gifted , dedicated and hunky Gael Garc√≠a Bernal ) is a true ' artist ' , a young man whose father is Mexican and whose mother is French , and he has entered Paris to begin a job his mother Christine ( Miou-Miou ) assures him is creative : it actually is a boring , restricting graphic design outfit ( though populated by some zany confr√®res including Guy played beautifully by Alain Chabat who allows to run with his idea of publishing a calendar whose months are pictured by world disasters ! ) that at first defeats St√©phane's artistic integrity . St√©phane dreams and in his dream life he is a TV host who can make the most impossible things happen . His work frustrations push him further into his dream world and he finds it more real than the mundane life of daytime . He lives across the hall from an equally delicate artistic mind named St√©phanie ( the always fine and adroit Charlotte Gainsbourg ) who is caught up in her own dream world of making little boats of paper and water of cellophane and clouds of cotton . The two begin a touch and run relationship that gradually develops into a mutual appreciation for each other's idiosyncrasies - in the best of all possible ways . Gondry peppers his script with make-believe constructions , testy conversations , and some very funny and naughty observations that he tosses off with aplomb . Gael Garc√≠a Bernal infuses this strange role with a facile use of three languages ( English , French and Spanish ) and with a tender sense of comic timing and sensual magnetism that makes him irresistible . He carries the fantasy on his capable shoulders allowing us to love his bizarrely complex character at every quirky turn . He is an actor who takes more risks than most and is destined to be one of our more important actors as he continues to gain attention . For those who need sharp margins of linearity and borders between reality and fantasy , this film may confuse and frustrate . But for viewers who love ' taking rides through dream fantasies on felt horses ' this film is sure to please . Grady Harp

374,"Text1: Lucy & Desi and Rodgers & Hart ' Too Many Girls ' is froth , but it's well-made froth : a fun movie musical that's just slightly below top-notch , based on a 1939 Broadway musical comedy of the same name , starring Eddie Bracken and Desi Arnaz ( who repeat their stage roles here ) . The songs are by Rodgers and Hart , but only one song here has become a standard : ' I Didn't Know What Time It Was ' . One song from the Broadway version that doesn't show up here is ' I Like to Recognise the Tune ' , a snappy quartet . When I interviewed Eddie Bracken in 1993 , he told me that this had been his favourite song in the original Broadway production , and he was disappointed that he didn't get a chance to perform it in the film version . One problem with ' Too Many Girls ' is that it's got almost exactly the same plot as the Gershwins ' musical ' Girl Crazy ' , but with the sexes reversed . In ' Girl Crazy ' , a wealthy young playboy from New York is sent by his father to a tiny ranch in the Southwest to keep him away from his multiple girlfriends . In ' Too Many Girls ' , a wealthy young playgirl from New York ( Lucille Ball ) is sent by her father to a tiny college in the Southwest to keep her away from her boyfriend . . . a guy with the improbable name Beverly Waverly . ' Too Many Girls ' doesn't stand up to comparison with the other show : ' Girl Crazy ' came first , and it features George and Ira Gershwin's best score ever . . . whereas Rodgers and Hart were not up to their usual standard when they wrote the songs for ' Too Many Girls ' . I was never a fan of Lucille Ball , because I dislike the ridiculous character she played in all her tv series and most of her movies . In ' Too Many Girls ' , amazingly , she gives one of her very few realistic performances as a plausible human being , and she's actually quite good here . I wish she'd played roles like this more often . It was during production of ' Too Many Girls ' that Lucille Ball met Desi Arnaz , leading to their marriage and a tv series that I always considered vastly overrated . But Arnaz is quite good in ' Too Many Girls ' , playing a Cuban conga player ( what a stretch ! ) who isn't at all like Ricky Ricardo . Desi and Lucy are not teamed in this movie : each of their screen characters is attracted to somebody else . Arnaz , Bracken , Richard Carlson and Hal LeRoy play four football heroes . Arnaz and Carlson are believable as gridiron stars , and Bracken might just possibly be a place kicker . . . but the slender and limp-wristed Hal LeRoy is just not plausible as a football player . LeRoy does absolutely nothing to justify his presence in this movie except for a big production number halfway through the film , in which he does a spirited tap dance on top of a tom-tom . For some reason , this dance is cut out of most television prints of this movie . There's an amusing running gag concerning college girls who wear beanies to let the male students know whether or not the girls are sexually available . You might spot Van Johnson very briefly in two of the dance numbers . At the end of the show , Desi Arnaz whips out his conga drum , and does a very energetic rendition of ' Babalu ' while all the college students form a conga line across the campus . This leads to a bizarre joke which physically disgusted me , when a biology professor peers down a microscope and he sees a bunch of microbes forming a conga line . The crude animation for this brief gag makes the microbes look nauseating : also , this joke is a rip-off of an animation gag in the 1930 movie ' Good News ' , in which some chalk drawings suddenly start dancing during the ' Pass that Peace Pipe ' number . ' Too Many Girls ' is a lot of fun . I don't like Lucille Ball's tv shows , but she gives a fine performance here , and I'll rate this movie .


Text2: A Twist on the Theme of a Love Affair L'amour Dangereux is a beautifully filmed and very well written ( Fran√ßois Lemaire , Steve Suissa and Samantha Mazeras ) story that finds more information about the early stages of love in the young set than a score of other films . Director Steve Suissa knows exactly how to balance the motivations and the responses of his cast , making a potentially predictable story one that holds our attention - and hearts - from the first frame to the last . Simon ( Nicholas Cazale , a formidable screen presence ) is a lower class laborer , kind , caring , industrious , and ' in love ' with a girl Noemie ( Jennifer Decker ) he has observed since childhood , a girl whose parents are property ( shop ) owners and thus in another class . Always ready to increase his work to make a better salary , Simon accepts a questionable ' job ' for 500 Euros for just 2 hours work . Needless to say the job is a robbery and Simon , in the course of the failed robbery , assaults a policeman who is attacking his friend , wounding the policeman badly . The others in the robbery are caught but Simon escapes . He visits the caf√© where Noemie works , asks her if she has car keys and Noemie not only gives Simon her father's car and keys , but also asks Simon to accompany him on his escape . The remainder of the film is a road trip with Simon ( who is age 18 ) and Noemie ( age 16 ) running from the police . They find joys in nature , live in a small shack on the beach , and fall in love in one of the most sensitively written sequences on film . Simon is hesitant to say he loves Noemie because he feels responsible for her : Noemie begins to feel she must return home but will stay if Simon will only say he loves her . The cops led by the wily inspector Queyrolles ( Bruno Wolkowitch ) close in and Simon is captured and the manner in which the film ends is one that reinforces the importance of truth in life and relationships . What could have been a Hollywoodesque ending complete with suicide leap is instead a tender working through of personal growth . Nicolas Cazale is one of the more sensitive actors in French film today ( ' Three Dancing Slaves ' , multiple TV roles ) and this film should make him a star . The entire cast - including Marc Samuel as Simon's misunderstood father - is splendid . The cinematography is magnificent and the tender musical scoring mixing Schubert , Chopin and modern songs fit the mood perfectly . This is an amazing little film that bravely takes on issues of the Romeo and Juliet manner and remains entirely unique . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp

375,"Text1: Bava turns his attention to a new genre and does a creditable job . Mario Bava , the late , great master of artfully done horror films , tackled a completely different genre - the crime thriller - in this incredibly gripping film . A trio of no-count hoodlums : cool , calm and collected "" Doctor "" ( Maurice Poli ) , and the mangy duo of Bisturi ( Aldo Capone ) and "" Thirty-Two "" ( Luigi Montefiori , a . k . a . George Eastman ) , pull off a violent robbery and take it on the lam . They soon have acquired themselves some hostages : Maria ( Lea Lander ) and Riccardo ( Riccardo Cucciolla ) , and force Riccardo to drive them the rest of the way to their destination . Bava proved just as adept at this sort of material as the more fantastical stuff . It's stylish and energetic , not to mention extremely grim and gritty . He and his crew were aiming for "" maximum cynicism "" , which they pull off in a major way . The movie , largely confined to the interior of a car , creates an overwhelmingly claustrophobic setting , with many close-ups of the actors ' intense and sweaty faces . The movie pulls none of its punches and can make a viewer feel as if they a part of the action as well ; it has that sense of immediacy . In fact , that was another aim of the film-makers : to make it appear , as much as possible , that the story was unfolding in real time . This movie moves at a true machine-gun pace ; it's established in the first few minutes and simply does not let up until the picture is well under-way . Bava was apparently quite enthused to be working on this project , which would prove to be contagious . It can quite easily make the viewer enthusiastic watching it . Adding to the entertainment factor is Stelvio Cipriani's immensely enjoyable , funky and flashy music score . It's also quite an attraction to see so much of the Italian countryside . Fans of the film and the director know the following details , but for the uninitiated I should mention that this film might not have seen the light of day . The production company went into bankruptcy before the completion of the film and it was locked away for many years until co-star Lander was instrumental in rescuing it and getting it a release . Producer Alfredo Leone and Mario's son , director Lamberto Bava ( longtime assistant to his father ) would re-edit the film , shoot new material and opening credits , and change the ending and music score , giving it the new title "" Kidnapped "" . The cast really gives this 100 % . Cucciolla ( who Bava had wanted for the lead from the start ) and Poli are excellent as the most controlled of the characters , with Eastman a real hoot as the deliciously unhinged "" Thirty-Two "" . He and Capone make for a great pair of depraved lowlifes . This film is a lot of fun , and worth catching for any Bava fans that have yet to see it .


Text2: Ideal vehicle for the late , great Lee Marvin . Lee Marvin is the cold-as-ice Walker , living only for one thing : to get back his fair share of a heist pulled years earlier . Receiving assistance from a stranger named Yost ( Keenan Wynn ) , he takes on the Organization that his traitorous "" friend "" Mal Reese ( John Vernon ) has joined . "" Point Blank "" , based on a novel by Donald E . Westlake ( using the pseudonym Richard Stark ) is an impressive thriller from director John Boorman , pre - "" Deliverance "" . It's both tough & brutal as well as bleak and haunting . Boorman makes great use of montage and flashbacks , as the film switches between moments in the past and present . His stylish thriller is well shot , edited , scored , and paced , with great use of its San Francisco locations . It creates a seedy world full of characters who if not blatantly dubious are still morally compromised in one way or another . It's a stirring tale of the "" no honor among thieves "" variety that cannily combines art , grit , and atmosphere , right up to an effectively ambiguous ending . Marvin's Walker is one of his best ever parts ; he perfectly inhabits this character who seems just so dead inside . Angie Dickinson , as sexy as she's ever been , is the sister of his wife who gives him some assistance . Wynn is fantastic as the character whose motivations don't become clear until the end ( this revelation is pulled off well ) . Vernon is excellent as the sneaky and self-serving Mal . Lovely Sharon Acker makes the most of her brief screen time as Walker's repentant wife . Carroll O'Connor , Michael Strong , and Lloyd Bochner all play a great bunch of slimy villains . And turning up in bit parts are actors such as James B . Sikking , Kathleen Freeman , and Sid Haig . One of the more striking films of its decade , "" Point Blank "" is a crime thriller worth catching . The novel was filmed again as the 1999 Mel Gibson vehicle "" Payback "" .

Most of her films and performances are really good - and she has been one of the few ( very few ) "" Blond Bombshells "" with lasting movie power . Personally I think she knows how to choose most of her properties , and that helps . THE BANGER SISTERS is a sensible variant on THELMA AND LOUIS , which Hawn's co-star , Susan Sarandon , made with Geena Davis years earlier . Unlike that classic which ended in a suicidal drive off a cliff by the heroines , this one confronts the issues of individuality reemerging with less destruction as a result . Suzette ( Hawn ) has just been fired from her job , and is driving in the southwest without any really clear plan for future action . She stops in the desert and picks up Harry Plummer ( Geoffrey Rush - with a nicely done American accent in this film ) . Plummer is a writer at beam's end - suffering numerous emotional quirks and a current writer's block , all of which he blames on his father . It seems nothing Harry ever did pleased his father . He is going to Phoenix , Arizona to confront the old man . Suzette drives him to Phoenix , and after they separate she goes to look up her oldest friend "" Vinnie "" ( short for Lavinia - Sarandon ) . She finds her friend in an up-scale section of Phoenix , and watches her friend kiss her daughter ( older daughter Hannah - Ericka Christensen ) good night as the daughter goes off to her high school graduation prom . Sarandon is certainly dressed like a social matron type now - understandably as we later learn her husband ( Raymond Kingsley - Robin Thomas ) is a highly successful lawyer with political aspirations . But this is unsettling to Suzette - when she knew Vinnie they were palling around Los Angeles twenty years later , and having a raucous old time . Suzette returns to the hotel that Harry is at , and ( despite his protests ) camps down there in a spare room . Harry is too neurotic to take advantage of Suzette's free-spirit offer of sex , but he does allow her to stay . It's lucky she does - Hannah and her fellow students are at their prom in the hotel , and Hannah had taken some bad "" acid "" and gotten sick . Suzette steps in to help Hannah with this problem , and then drives her back to her home . And in doing so she confronts Vinnie . Vinnie recognizes Suzette - and totally misunderstands her being there . She thinks that Suzette is there to get money . Quite hurt at this ( and an offer to give her $5 , 000 . 00 ) , Suzette explains she was just driving Hannah home and leaves . Vinnie learns from Hannah that she took drugs and Suzette helped her . Later that morning the still stiff-necked Vinnie visits Suzette in Harry's hotel room and apologizes ( stiffly ) and offers to take her to lunch the next day . Suzette accepts . Two plots slowly evolve here . Harry's neuroses towards women crumble as he gets to know what Suzette is like - he even keeps a hot bath for her while she is out driving Hannah back home . Suzette and Vinnie get to know each other and the divide between them as Suzette watches how Vinnie is a control freak over Hannah's relationship with a boyfriend , and on trying to build-up the self-esteem of younger daughter Ginger ( Eva Amurri ) despite the latter's bratty crying and selfishness . Vinnie notes how all her clothes "" are beige "" while Suzette looks like a walking flower ( because of her free and easy lifestyle ) . While Suzette slowly gets Harry to emerge from his neurotic cocoon ( and even start typing up a literary storm while she is out ) , she also reawakens long dormant freedoms that Vinnie clamped down on in

Text2: Alexander Korda and his history lessons Born in Hungary , Alexander Korda became a leading figure in British cinema . He would approach Hollywood in his production , casting , and vision of how movies should be made . And he was quite aware of what he was facing in his struggles . Britain's film industry was never as wealthy as it's American cousin ( or it's German cousin , for that matter ) . But due to language it had inroads to the United States as well as the empire . If it could not meet Hollywood's ( or Ufa's ) best production values , it had a stable of actors that were hard to match . In fact , many of them ended up in Hollywood ( much to Korda's disgust ) . This was not only those born in the British Isles like Olivier , Leigh , Laughton , but also those who were foreign born who ended up in British films as stars ( like Veidt ) . Korda also had European history and culture to play with , and in the 1930s would do a series of films that involved both . They centered on some historical or legendary character : Henry VIII , Don Juan , Catherine the Great , Rembrandt , the Roman Emperor Claudius . Laughton appeared in three of these , as Henry , Rembrandt , and Claudius . Douglas Fairbanks Sr . would be Don Juan and his son would be Catherine's husband Peter III of Russia . There were also "" foreign "" or "" imperial "" settings for some of these epics . Sabu became Kipling's Mowgli in "" The Jungle Book "" . The Arabian Nights were the basis for "" The Thief of Baghdad "" . Henry VIII is really not filling in the entire monarch's life or reign . It barely notices wife # 1 ( Catherine of Aragon ) , who it considers dull . It begins with the conclusion of the second marriage with Anne Boleyne in 1536 , and then jumps rapidly into the brief third marriage , the comedy of the fourth marriage in 1541 , the deep tragedy of the fifth marriage in 1544 , and the last marriage , wherein Henry seems to have married a nurse and a scold ( not really historically correct ) . Laughton is superb as a man , seeming with everything , who can't ( for one reason or another ) find the happiness he seeks in a content home life . But the film does not delve into his policies , and it really does not get into the personality conflicts within Henry's character . He does act the bully and the gallant and the buffoon ( such as when discoursing on fine table manners ) , but the parts ( if analyzed ) do not hold together as well as say Robert Shaw's sly and sinister monarch in "" A Man For All Seasons "" , but Shaw is playing a younger man in a period of only six years , while Laughton is dealing with nearly twelve years as the same man fights to retain youth and yet ages badly due to ill-health . Laughton did deserve his Oscar , but Shaw needed two more films of Henry at later stages to fill in his first rate junior portrait . Laughton did well with Henry , as Korda did by selecting Laughton . We are the richer for both of their visions .

377,"Text1: Karloff & Daniell Haunt Old Edinburgh THE BODY SNATCHER who supplies fresh corpses for an Edinburgh doctor in 1831 soon adds blackmail & murder to his iniquitous deeds . This was one of a short series of horror films in which Boris Karloff starred for producer Val Lewton , the others being ISLE OF THE DEAD ( 1945 ) & BEDLAM ( 1946 ) . Lewton had the knack of producing films full of atmosphere & menace on a very low budget and THE BODY SNATCHER is no exception , getting most of its chills from the wonderful acting and the literate , intelligent script - although the climax is genuinely terrifying . Karloff is chillingly perfection in the role of the sly coachman who augments his salary with a little grave robbing . A gentle man who is kind to crippled children , yet can murder without a second thought , Karloff paints the cunning portrait of a very human monster . Every step of the way , however , he is equaled by Henry Daniell , a wonderful British character actor who never received due recognition for his skills . Playing a brilliant anatomist who feels he must continue to use Karloff's gruesome deliveries for the light they shine on solving medical problems , Daniell delivers an elegant portrayal of a deeply conflicted man who is pulled ever nearer the center of the vortex . In a relatively small role - his last with Karloff - Bela Lugosi is memorable as a greedy servant who tries blackmail at the worst possible time . Russell Wade as a medical student and Rita Corday as a young patient's widowed mother help move the plot along , but wisely no romantic subplot is allowed to develop . Edith Atwater does very well as Daniell's housekeeper , a woman with many secrets . Movie mavens will recognize elderly Mary Gordon , unbilled as the pathetic mother at Greyfriars graveyard . At one time , the bodies of executed prisoners supplied the medical schools of Britain with all the corpses they could use for the purposes of dissecting & lecturing . But judicial reform nearly dried up the flow of bodies from that source , while the proliferation of new schools and anatomy theatres made the shortage acute . The medieval laws still on the books made the legal acquirement of bodies almost impossible . The ghastly vocation of body snatching thus arose to fill this void . Body Snatchers - also referred to as grave robbers , resurrectionists , or Sack ' Em Up Boys - would haunt cemeteries by night , looking for the recently deceased to disinter . Often the caretakers in the graveyards would be in financial league with these hooligans , as well as the doctors at the medical schools . Prices paid for the bodies could be quite exorbitant , considering the risks that were taken . Leaving dogs or spring-loaded guns at the graveside were just some of the elaborate precautions taken by the friends of the deceased , who often kept vigil by the graves until enough time had passed to make the corpse no longer desirable . Eventually , it became quite difficult to count on the graveyards to furnish enough fodder for the grisly trade . ' The ruffian dogs , the hellish pair , The villain Burke , the meager Hare . . . Nor did they handle ax or knife To take away their victim's life . . . No sooner done than in the chest They crammed their lately welcome guest . . . ' Arriving in Edinburgh in 1827 , William Burke met fellow Irishman William Hare , who was keeper of a low lodging house . Scurrilous rascals both , when an old pensioner died there in November of that year , Burke & Hare sold the body to a surgeon for 7¬£ , 10 shillings . Delighted with this easy money , the nefarious pair soon took to hastening the deaths of their ' subjects . ' At least 15 hapless victims were lured into the lodging house and smothered ( so as to leave no sign of violence on their flesh ) , the bodies then sold to respected surgeon Robert Knox . On Halloween in 1828 , suspicious neighbors summoned police and enough evidence was found to immediately arrest Burke & Hare . At the trial , Hare turned King's evidence and admitted to the murders . He was released and promptly disappeared . In his confession , Burke completely exonerated Knox of any knowledge of the killings , but the doctor was hounded by the press & public and quickly relocated to London , where he carried on a successful career .

What is the disease that turns people into zombies ? Why is Carmilla a Vampire ? Who is Julia to her ? Who the hell is The General ? What does he want ? Where are Travis & Jenna going ? How can Travis run a man over & yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it ? What's with the mental ward at the end ? There are also some confusing & unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more . There are just so many things wrong with this film , the narrative doesn't make a blind bit of sense , the concept is terrible & never really explained properly plus it's incredibly boring .

Forget about any Vampires fighting Zombies because it just doesn't happen , tell me again why is this film called Vampires Vs . Zombies ? Director D'Amato has served up one of the most incompetent , rubbishy , badly made , poorly thought out & excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made . Vampires Vs . Zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all , there is not one single aspect that I can praise . The gore is really fake looking , there are some blood splats which look like red water , some really cheap staking effects & a half decent climax where the zombies feast on Carmilla's & Jenna's intestines , this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes & in no way makes up for the other turgid 85 . The budget on Vampires Vs . Zombies must have been small , in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars . This is one of the most badly made horror films it's been my misfortune to watch , the entire thing just sucks . The acting is predictably awful , & I mean awful .

Text2: Yet another failed second sequel . It's extremely difficult to make a good "" Part 3 "" in any franchise , and Saw is a perfect example . The descent in quality from parts 1 and 2 to this one is so precipitous that it makes me think of the fact that , in trilogies or otherwise , good second sequels are extremely hard to come by . Back to the Future and Alien 3 are the only two that I can think of at the moment , and there's a Saw 4 . It starts with the investigation of a man who had chains attached to numerous parts of his body , and he had to rip them off in order to get out of a room before a bomb exploded . One of the detectives says that that was "" all he had to do . "" He gets mocked for this by another detective , since the man had to rip chains out of both of his Achilles tendons . Makes it a little hard to walk out of anywhere . At any rate , before long we sit through a pointless series of scenes showing the kidnappings of various victims , ripe for the fast-forward button . By this point in any series or franchise or whatever , the formula will be getting pretty old and tired unless something new is added . There's nothing new here . It's the same old crap about this guy John Kramer somehow having the time to devise unbelievably complex torture devices and little puzzles for the victims to try to solve in order to escape . The biggest problem is that by now it is getting so ridiculous to see this guy devise schemes to literally rip people to pieces while at the same time trying to criticize people for neglecting children and wives . What ? ? ? Sorry John , but the brutal tortures and murders are having the little unexpected side effect of damaging your credibility just a tiny bit . In this installment , John has kidnapped a doctor and is forcing her to keep him alive . I love her introduction , by the way . She performs one of those movie operations where she does something miraculous , saves a young child's life , and everyone around her gets mad at her for it . I love that . Talk about not being appreciated . And on top of that , her marriage is falling apart . Soon she finds herself kidnapped and wearing a collar that's basically half a dozen guns pointed at her throat . Maybe my own luck isn't so bad after all . And the brilliant talent of Angus Macfadyen is totally wasted as Jeff , Dr . Denlon's ( Bahar Soomekh ) husband and another of Jigsaw's victims . Here's the whole movie - "" Hello so and so , I want to play a game . The device you are wearing is attached to your whatever , in order to escape you'll have to pass a series of tests . Let the game begin . Blah blah blah blah blah ? ? "" If this is getting old for you , don't feel like you're missing anything if you stop watching these movies now . By this point , the Saw films are only for hardcore Saw and horror fans , the latter of which I used to consider myself but with each movie like this that comes along , the further away from the genre I feel . Remember Hostel ? If that's where horror movies are going , to that level of vacuous thought and logic , I'm done , I can tell you that right now . Saw 3 is a hundred times better , but still a bad movie . One of the major revelations that this sequel adds to the series is that we see an interesting setup to the original film , as well as behind the scenes of how and why some of the devices are created and Amanda's relationship to Kramer , the killer . Their relationship is ridiculous in the extreme , they just don't make a lick of sense as human beings . Not even a drug addict would get as emotionally attached to such a pasty , brutal man as this guy . Her tears before his surgery are outdone in bizarre ridiculousness only by her reaction of disgust during his surgery . Ripping that woman's rib cage apart didn't seem to bother her so much . Maybe it was the licensed physician that was worrying her . Speaking of which , there is nothing dumber than people who blame doctors for their illnesses . Dr","{""output"": ""NO""}"

What a wonderful fantasy-comedy-romance concerning the two leads and surrounded by such hilarious supporting performances of Robert Benchley , Cecil Kellaway , a young Susan Hayward , and that lady who kept singing "" I Love You Truly "" ( Helen St . Rayner ) ! Witty lines , awesome visual effects , and perfect timing combine to make this one of the most pleasant surprises from the Golden Age of Movies when audiences wanted escapism from the war that was raging at the time . It was perhaps because of this movie-and possibly Smith's original source novel-that helped make the classic TV series "" Betwitched "" - with Elizabeth Montgomery as another stunning blond witch you'd love to go home to-possible . Certainly , Ms . Lake is at her most beautiful here and-despite what I've read about her and Mr . March's dislike off-screen-has great chemistry with her co-star . Most hilarious scenes involve Mr . Kellaway and his drunken forgetfulness concerning his spells ! For anyone who doesn't mind a classic fantasy filmed in black-and-white , I Married a Witch should be right up your alley !


Text2: Live-action Underdog may be more entertaining for kids than adults When I saw the trailer for Underdog with my friend , he thought it would be good while I thought it would be just mediocre . With the actual movie those were the thoughts each of us had of it since he laughed at most of it while I just sat there only occasionally chuckling . With Disney's name on it , I pretty much expected some lessons and cutesy humor that kids would eat up and make us sophisticated adults want something more . . . sophisticated . With a cast like Peter Dinklage , Patrick Warburton , John Slattery , James Belushi ( okay , maybe not him ) , and the voices of Brad Garrett and Jason Lee as the title character , part of me hoped maybe some clever lines would come out of them , not so . Most of the humor is visual and not wacky-visual but more amusingly-playful-visual though the scene that Underdog does to the Garrett-voiced dog at the end made me laugh a little loud . So , like I said , this wasn't hilarious , just partly amusing . The beginning with scenes of the actual Underdog cartoons were probably the most entertaining along with some of the bloopers at the end . All in all , kids under 12 will probably enjoy this more than childless adults . P . S . I saw this with a trailer of Alvin and the Chipmunks with Lee as the live-action David Seville . I hope that isn't as mediocre as this one .

This is a solid re-telling of the Dracula story with some legitimate thrills provided to the viewer along with pretty photography and sets and a tasteful lack of blood . I'm curious how this looks and sounds on DVD . Story-wise , they might have embellished some of the action scenes and made Dracula a little more powerful . ( I can't see him feeling a regular human being which he did here in the end . ) Other than that , it's a well-done movie with no exaggerated characters , nice colors , no problem understanding accents . . . . one of the better Dracula films ever made , just maybe the best .

Text2: A Shockingly-Straight Story From David Lynch "" A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love "" describes this odd David Lynch film . This was especially "" odd "" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 - 20 years . Those were dark and shocking films ( Blue Velvet , Wild At Heart , Mulholland Drive ) and this is the opposite . I know it disappointed a lot of his fans . Others were delighted by it . Count me as one of the latter , and I own all three of those "" dark "" films , too . This was another supposed-true life story , here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies . Well , I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an "" odd "" film of sorts , so Lynch stays in character with that ! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role . He is the type of guy , face-wise , voice-wise , low-key personality-wise , that just about everyone likes . The wrinkles on his face tell many a story . It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released . The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much , and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child ( Sissy Spacek ) and her tragic past , but once Alvin Straight ( Farnsworth ) begins his trip , the story picks up . I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up , but I am more generous with it . I think it's a hidden gem . To them , it was a sleeping pill . I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story . It IS slow and if that's okay with you , you might like this . Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way , such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble . ( Henry Cada as "" Daniel Riordan , is a standout in that regard . ) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing , but that's a joke : he's only in the final few minutes of the movie ! The Iowa scenery is pleasant . I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil . It's a nice state with nice people . . . . like this movie .

Text2: Wow . Very rarely do you seriously come across a movie with no redeeming values whatsoever . I mean , there are tons of movies these days that are so bad that you say something like that about them , but it's a rare occurrence when you can apply that statement literally . Neon Maniacs is the story of a lot of creepy monsters that live under the Golden Gate Bridge , evidently for no other reason than to make people wonder why a lot of monsters who can be killed by water would choose to live so close to it . In thinking back on the movie , is there really any reason at all why they live under the Golden Gate Bridge ? Is it just so they can include a couple shots of the bridge at the opening of the movie ? Not only do we never find out why these creatures live to close to the one thing that can destroy them on contact , but we also never know where they came from or why they are killing people . Maybe they're upset because they're different . This is definitely an 80s horror film , so obviously you expect the acting to be just as bad as it is , and I think that Neon Maniacs really tests your levels of belief by trying to get you to believe that teenagers in the 80s thought it was the cool thing to do late at night to park their van in the middle of some park and play football and make out in the woods . Oddly enough , as dumb as that sounds , it looks even dumber on screen . I will not waste your time describing what kind of creatures these are , because they are little more than some make-up artists weak effort to make some disgusting monsters for a meaningless horror film and their exact descriptions are beside the point . There is everything from an alien to an ape-man , so you can just imagine for yourself what's in between , if you're lucky enough not to have seen this movie . If you've read any of the other reviews of this movie on the IMDb , you already know that the movie sets up for a sequel that was never made ( my good friend and colleague Christopher Brown makes a good point in his review , that the sequel may have never been made because Lightning Video went out of business , but he also makes a shocking miscalculation of the quality of the movie itself ? sorry Chris ! ) . It's true that the movie leaves the possibility of a sequel so open that it calls too much attention to the fact that one was never made , but this is not an uncommon way to end movies like this . Little Shop of Horrors , for example , had a very similar ending , with the grinning plant showing up in the cute garden at the end of the film . Personally , I am more concerned with the sheer lack of quality of any kind from top to bottom in this movie ( there's a scene at the end , during the ' climax ' of the film , where the hero and heroine are hiding from the approaching demons , and decide to lay down on the floor and make-out and just not worry about the monsters that are closing in , I guess hoping that they will just disappear ? as it turns out , they were right ) , and besides that , even if someone wrote a sequel to this mess , who in their right mind would want to direct it ?

I watched the film last night and over all , I'd say it wasn't too bad , I've seen a thousand times worse . The only major complaint , was the lesbian sex scene really necessary ? Like , what did that have to do with the story at all ? It's not like it was even realistic , it was some sick director's fantasy , because they are drop dead gorgeous girls who are moving like a porno film , it was just ridicules . The effects were actually kinda cool though , like the scene where the guy was torn apart by the ghosts was visually very cool to look at . The CGI is a little much , but to be honest , I'm at that point where I'm giving up and just accepting it , so I'm going to let go the over the top stuff go , but it's a cool horror story . Ariel's sister just supposedly killed herself and has a secret about the haunted hill house , there is a statue in there that is worth millions . Leading us to the "" bad guys "" who are in it for the money and are using Ariel and her boyfriend to the house to get it . But they meet a professor and his student who are also after the statue , leading like Indiana Jones , and claims the statue should be in a museum . But understandably Ariel just wants to get out of there , but the house won't let her . Return to House on Haunted Hill is not too bad , really . I'd say there is a good amount of scares and the story is decent enough , it's not your typical bad bad sequel that I expected . Would I recommend it to anyone ? Not too many people , I think you'll have to see yourself , and be in a good mood to see a horror movie . Otherwise if you take the time to watch this , don't take it too seriously , because you are going to hate it . Gotta love the boy fantasy of having three women together naked and moving like a porno movie .


Text2: Hey , where has the house gone ? ? Ah , the house that vanished ? This oddball ( alternate ) title alone was more than enough reason for me to purchase a copy of this obscure and relatively unknown horror flick . But unfortunately , and as the case with too many 70's horror efforts , the title is by far the most exciting aspect about the entire production . This is an unbelievably dull film , stuffed with all the annoying genre-clich√©s and predictable plot-twist you can possibly think of . During the opening sequences , we follow a young couple ? a photo model and her petty thief lover ? as they break into an isolated house during a foggy night . There they witness a murder and only the girl manages to escape into the woods surrounding the house . And , in case you wonder , the title is really accurate ! When the girl ? Valerie ? wants to show some of her friends where the murder took place , she can't locate the house anymore ! ? Like it vanished into thin air ! Anyway , life goes on and Valerie falls in love with a strangely introvert boy who has a peculiar affair with his aunt and classical music plays whenever he's on screen . The murderer hasn't forgotten about Valerie yet and all kind of sinister happenings lead her back to the murder-house . The plot sounds sensational on paper , and I'm convinced it could have been really great , but the elaboration is very poor and way too slow . The only things to admire during the tedious middle section of the film are main actress Andrea Allan's good looks and her smoking HOT body . Yes , I am aware this is a shallow remark to make , but her spontaneous stripteases truly are the only moments that hold your attention . Director Jos√© Ram√≥n Larrez seems to realize this too , since the amount of sleaze and nudity gradually increases as the film reaches towards its climax . There's very little suspense and the few murder scenes are tame and as good as bloodless . The more than obvious denouement is almost like an insult to trained horror fans .

But before I get to that , I'll cover a couple aspects of the film that really worked for me . First , the action sequences are generally well done . As individual set pieces , the action scenes work . Second , when I first heard that Kelsey Grammar was brought on board to play the Beast in X-Men : The Last Stand , I was a little apprehensive . I mean the thought of Frasier Crane doesn't exactly conjure images of an action hero . After seeing the film , I cannot imagine anyone else in the role . Grammar is the center of attention in every scene in which he appears ? and it's not just the makeup . On to the problems : I can sum up most of the issues I have with X-Men : The Last Stand in two words ? Brett Ratner . The decision to allow Ratner to direct X-Men : The Last Stand was a total mistake . Ratner seems to think that throwing together action sequences and CGI effects is all you need to make a good movie . Sorry Mr . Ratner , but the first two films were much more than this . The script and direction feel rushed and sloppy with little thought given to what made the series so good to begin with . There is no character development . Mutants are thrown on screen with the sole purpose of showing off special effects ? not in an attempt to create memorable characters . And the characters from the previous two movies are handled poorly . Jean Grey's conversion to the Phoenix isn't explained at all . And she does nothing for most of the movie other than standing around looking like a reject from an army of the undead . Cyclops , a major character from the other movies , is killed off with no fanfare . And his death occurs off-screen ! Why ? Rogue is totally unnecessary . None of her scenes have anything to do with the plot other than adding some unneeded WB style melodrama . Professor Xavier and Mystique ? gone far too quickly . And Wolverine has been reduced to little more than an Arnold Schwarzenegger wannabe spouting one-liners like he's working at the local comedy club . I could go on and on , but you get the idea . In short , it's a disaster .

Made in the late 1960s , it became a hit with American audiences in the grips of our madness called "" Vietnam "" . British soldier Charles Pumpnick ( Alan Bates ) is ordered in a typical screw-up to go into a French village to defuse a large bomb left by the Germans . It is World War I , and the British are led by Col . MacBibbenbrook ( Adolfo Celi ) who is actually sending Pumpnick for a second reason : he wants to know if the Germans have actually left the town , so that his soldiers can "" reoccupy "" it . Given the tedious and murderous stalemate on the Western Front between the Allies and Central Powers in their trenches , any temporary regaining of land is a great victory . The Germans are led by an officer as fully suspicious of the British as MacBibbenbrook is of them . So he decides to test the waters by pulling out most of the troops , leaving a trio to watch for the British turning up . Pumpnick , rather reluctantly , does pop up , and soon discovers that the French citizenry has long since fled the town in the wake of the massive warfare around it . The only people he find seem very eccentric types . They should be - they are the inmates of the local insane asylum , who were abandoned by the doctors and staff . They have now decided to take over their imagined roles in the new reality of the deserted village . Soon Pumpnick realizes this , but he soon finds himself protective of these lunatics . He also finds their gentle insanity has some real substance to it that moves him - much more than the intense insanity of the outside world does . Other writers and artists have tackled the idea of the madmen running the asylum . A good example is Edgar Allen Poe , in his short story , "" The System of Dr . Tarr and Professor Feather "" . But Philippe De Broca's film compares insanity in two forms , and finds the form we normally "" punish "" by incarceration in asylums to be far kinder than the larger one . None of the madmen and women of the asylum threaten or hurt Pumpnick ( a point which shows this is a fantasy , as in real life they would have some dangerous types ) . The ones who we reward with rank and power are far more willing to send the Pumpnicks of the world into dangerous ( if not deadly ) situations . The conclusion of the film is too well known for me to discuss . I will only say that when the more dangerous outside lunatics get rid of each other's threat , Pumpnick opts to stay on with his new friends . They will welcome him . Aside from this I like to comment on more point . De Broca had a bit part where he shows that things on the outside can only get worse , when he shows up as Adolf Hitler briefly , delivering the German officer a message . Perhaps I should say the intensely bad situation will get even more intensely bad in twenty years time .

387,"Text1: A Nutshell Review : Shinobi ( 2005 ) There are many Romeo and Juliet type stories out there , and this happens to be one of them , set in Japanese medieval times , with fantastical martial arts moves that will probably wow action fans with their pace and brutality . It reminds me of the time when I was watching Hong Kong's Stormriders which somewhat raised the bar for such movies , and in terms of action set pieces , Shinobi doesn't disappoint . The story however , given its romantic element , somehow misses the mark . Yes , we know that it's written in the stars that the star crossed lovers are doomed to begin with when they fall for each other , having their only love sprung from their only hate , and it's actually quite a critical plot point in terms of character motivation when they become the appointed heads of their respective clans , but I guess romantic tangles get tossed aside when more room for action is required to satisfy genre fans . Shinobi is set during the time of feuding clans in the Tokugawa era . The Iga and the Kouga clans reside in hidden villages , and the Lord of Lords have just decreed that the clans can go on an all out war against each other . This naturally spells trouble for both Oboru ( Yukie Nakama ) and Kouga Gennosuke ( Jo Odagiri ) , who have recently professed their love for each other in secret . The decree dictates that each clan selects 5 of their best warriors to duke it out , and no prizes if you guess that both Oboru and Kouga Gennosuke are amongst the warriors selected . There's more political intrigue up the movie's sleeves , but these plots and schemes are secondary to the action that unfolds . Each of the 5 warriors have unique skills , and when they're exhibited , it's edge of your seat stuff excitement . However , the major flaw is that most of them are one skill wonders , meaning they're masters of that skill , and you see little more . It's akin to X-Men's mutants , and some powers though will ring familiar , like the blatant claws from fists , and healing prowess . But the best bits of powers though belong to our leads , because it's only natural for the most powerful to be leading their respective clans , but again , they suffer from limited fighting scenes . Most are quite violent and enhanced with some really nice special effects , but for those who are squeamish , you probably would wince at the stabbing , decapitations , etc . What started off quite promisingly , gets dragged into clich√©-land . Shinobi though boasts some stunning landscape visuals , that will make you wonder if they really exist , or are spruced up with a computer . Strictly for those who enjoy Romeo and Juliet interpreted in various retellings and adaptations , and fantastical kungfu junkies .


Text2: Good action , good acting , idiotic one-liners , a bonehead story , and James Bond at his most reckless . ( spoilers ) The traditional opening sequence of Tomorrow Never Dies is excellent . Especially when compared to the horrendous opening of the awful film that followed this one , The World Is Not Enough . When we see James Bond steal the bombs from the Nuclear Arms Bazaar in Russia , overcoming every obstacle ( including an overdone gunfight ) , we expect an awesome film to follow , but to a large extent we are disappointed . I'm willing to accept the suggestion that a fighter jet could be piloted , at least temporarily , with the knees , if the pilots hands are busy trying to prevent the co-pilot from strangling him . I actually liked that scene , but for him to also be able to fly right underneath another jet ( I won't even go into the fact that the pilot of the other jet didn't seem to notice this ) and eject the co-pilot into the co-pilot seat of the other jet , thus blowing it up , is just too far . Still , the opening scene , ending with Bond victoriously asking where the recovered bombs should be delivered , leaves the audience with a smile and the hopes of a quality action film to follow . The story involves a high-powered media mogul who intends to instigate World War III in order to boost his ratings and make him ridiculously rich . Although , from the looks of his ? office , ' he already IS ridiculously rich . No , this isn't original at all , but at least the scriptwriters were courteous enough to put the quote that they stole and made a movie out of right into the dialogue ( William Randolph Hearst once said , ' You provide the pictures , I'll provide the war . ' ) . There you have the entire plot of the film . The famous quote ' Good news is no news ' is another stolen item that can be found in Tomorrow Never Dies , thinly disguised in the clich√©d line , ' There's no news like bad news . ' As Bond first takes on his mission impossible , there is a good scene where he introduces himself as a banker to Mr . and Mrs . Elliott Carver ( the offending media mogul and one of Bond's own past lovers , respectively ) , but he revealed himself far too soon when he not so subtly make a comment about Carver's crimes . Sure , they have to get the movie going , but if he hadn't been so ham-handed in that scene , he might not have wound up in that sound proof room . Speaking of which , Elliott Carver , the media mogul , makes an extremely unimaginative villain for this 007 installation , and although he seems effective enough at first , he soon reduces himself to an annoying character who badly misuses his own power , leading to his own violent death in the spinning wheels of the horrendous exaggeration that was one of the tools he used to instigate his artificial war . Probably the best part of this whole movie is the unintentional comic relief . As I watched Tomorrow Never Dies , I found that I burst out laughing more often than I found myself on the edge of my seat . When Bond parks his car in the parking structure , after having stolen the decoder device , a bunch of bad guys arrive , tow truck and all , to break into the car and retrieve the decoder . It was funny enough when one of them tried the door handle , only to be given an electric shock , but when another one of them tried the other side , with the same result , I found myself in hysterics ! And then , just to make sure that Tomorrow Never Dies is not confused with an action movie that is to be taken seriously , a THIRD guy tries the door , receiving the obvious electric shock , after sledge hammers and machine guns had failed to provide entrance to the car . Which is weird , because the windows were shot out readily enough in the car chase that soon followed which was , by the way , the best action sequence in the entire movie . This is more of an action comedy than anything that Jackie Chan or Chris Tucker have ever done . The murders that James Bond commits in Tomorrow Never Dies are also fairly uncharacteristic .

Text2: Beautiful atmospheric suspense behind a darkly Machiavellian story Quite honestly , at first , I did not know what to make of this film . Upon first viewing , it seemed like an overly-long , over-dramatized , superficial piece of cinematic sludge . However , upon a second viewing , I've come to appreciate the fiendish wit , and slow building suspense which is comparable to the malevolent Hitchcock-ian style suspense fans will quickly recognize . However , it does lack the subtlety of said director's style but gives you in-your-face evil in its place . These performances are really quite indicative of America's New England accents , mind-sets , and coastal way of life . Everyone contributed above-average performances , so there is no need to single out anyone other than Colm Feore . Colm Feore takes on the character of Andre Linoge ; the personification of evil itself . As a Being of great power and extreme longevity , his quest for a prodigy is actually quite understandable . However , the way he goes about it , was psychologically sound in execution , and provides him the very end he desired . He divided . He terrorized . He manifested . He planted the seeds of apathy , and he conquered . Very cleverly written and portrayed with a marvelously Machiavellian execution . You never even notice that it was actually , Made for TV . There was one issue , I had with this film . You never discover what Linoge's race is . You are told he is neither a God , nor an Immortal .

He demonstrates some of the elder Vampyric abilities , but I got the feeling there was much more there than mere Vampyrism . It would have been nice to have been told .

With 4 Little Girls and especially When the Levees Broke , Lee takes focus of the subject matter , and expands upon the narrative to make the central story intertwined without losing anything close to worthwhile to know . It goes without saying it honors the memory of those four girls slain in the church in Birmingham , but it also honors the memory for the others who died and fought in the Civl Rights battle of the early 60s ( it was a battle by way of perpetration by the likes of "" Bull "" O'Connell , and the rabid racists like the only man who was convicted in the late 70s of the church bombing ) . Lee starts off profiling the girls and their childhoods , their parents and childhood friends recounting their innocence , their energy , being simply kids growing up happy but in the midst of racism all around them . From there Lee branches off - using the "" white / colored "" segregation of something as minor as a water fountain , to branch off to Birmingham itself , its history , being the focal-point of much of the strife for black people in the south , Dr . King's eventual and crucial involvement , and the white racists . It's staggering information one learns , even if one already thinks they know all there is to know about the civil rights struggle . Just the information on Governor George Wallace ( and , surprisingly , seeing Wallace interviewed with his near-gone voice and mind ) is enough to raise repeated eyebrows in astonishment . And then Lee brings it back to the girls again , and that fateful , cursed day that one family member said she saw in a nightmare the night before . The interviews are presented with unabashed compassion for the family members , but not with misplaced sentimentality . The case itself , and how it becomes one of the pivotal pieces that , tragedy besides , leads the civil rights movement even further , has so much power that it's impossible to dramatize it . Lee simply uses music , photographs , and the faces of those who knew these girls , as well as public figures ( i . e . Kronkite , Cosby , Jesse Jackson ) , to accentuate the material . It's skillful storytelling , and told with a story that needs to be told , and revealed to those who may forget the horrors of the American south merely forty-something years ago and more . Simply , one of the director's finest ' joints ' .


Text2: David Lynch's Bizarre Nightmare of Fatherhood This phantasmagorical David Lynch film is nearly suffocating in its ability to immerse its audience in a domestic nightmare . It's a fascinating film , but not one I can say I necessarily enjoyed watching . All of Lynch's fever dream movies are open to interpretation , so I can only say what I took from this film personally . To me it was entirely about the fear of responsibility and the potential stagnation that comes with domestic married life and fatherhood . The baby in this film is literally a creature from another planet ; it's threatening not because it's evil or menacing itself but rather because it has needs and wants that it has no clear way of communicating and which its father doesn't entirely comprehend . The film manages to capture in images and sounds the kind of abstract thoughts and fears that lead men into mid-life crises . It's a difficult film to summarize or even describe , other than to say that it lingers in the brain and is amazingly unsettling to watch .

He tries to reach out and deal with them but they resist - - lead on by Artie West ( Vic Morrow ) who is one step short of a psychopath . He keeps trying and then things get violent . . . Yes , it's very dated now . . . we have kids shooting teachers and other students dead nowadays , but in its time this was considered a truly shocking film . It was accused of provoking violence in schools ( which is ridiculous - - the film is anti-violence ) and was the first Hollywood film to use rock'n'roll in its soundtrack . All that aside it's still a good movie . The script is as explicit as Hollywood would let it be ( the kids don't swear but they come close ) and it was shot in gritty b & w . The performances are almost all uniformly excellent - - especially Sidney Poitier as Miller ; Margaret Hayes as a teacher who is almost raped and especially Morrow who is downright horrifying as West . It's hard to believe this was his first film . The only so so performances were by Ford ( too grim-faced ) and Anne Francis who has the hopeless role of his pregnant wife . I first saw this on TV when I was in high school ( 1976-1980 ) . I remember when "" Rock Around the Clock "" started blasting out during the opening credits I really felt a jolt go through me ( I can only imagine the effect in 1955 ) . I loved the movie but I realized it was probably toned down by Hollywood ( I found out later it was ) and I've never believed the "" happy "" ending . Still this is undeniably a powerful film and a definite must-see . Also , historically , it's an important film . A classic . A definite 10 .


Text2: Better than the original The original 1960 "" 13 Ghosts "" was a very boring , stupid horror film . This one , while no classic , is actually quite good . A grieving widower Arthur ( Tony Shalhoub ) , his hot daughter ( Shannon Elizabeth ) , annoying son ( Alec Roberts ) and feisty black maid / cook / babysitter / whatever ( Rah Digga ) get trapped in an all glass house with a sort of psychic ( Matthew Lilliard ) and a ghost liberator ( Embeth Davidtz ) . It was set up by the evil Cyrus ( F . Murray Abraham ) and he has 12 murderous ghosts in cages down in the basement . But they all get out , one by one , and go after the family . This is pretty dull stuff until they get locked in the house , the ghosts escape . . . then the movie REALLY gets going . The ghosts are very brutal-looking and their attacks are bloody and violent . In a nice tip of the hat to the original , people in the movie can only see the ghosts when they have special glasses on . The special effects are excellent and it has more than a few scary scenes . The plot does go out the window at the end , but I was still interested . The acting - - Shalhoub is OK as the father . Davidtz is in it for the money ( and her character is badly written ) . Lilliard goes way over the top . . . as always ( take a few Valium bud ) . . . seriously , can't this guy do anything but overact ? Elizabeth is full of life and is viciously attacked in one scene but she's not in the movie enough . Roberts is just annoying as the kid . And F . Murray . . . he can play this villain role in his sleep . . . and he does . And Digga is funny but her character is clich√© city . No masterpiece but not the disaster I was expecting .

Text2: Father of the Bride As far as I can work out , it is after this film that the career of Steve Martin has had very few laughs , which is a shame , he just needs to find the right film . Anyway , this is the remake of the 1950 film , and it sees middle aged father George Banks ( Martin ) with wife Nina ( Diane Keaton ) having to prepare the wedding for their 21-year-old daughter Annie Banks ( Kimberly Williams-Paisley ) . They had never met her fianc√©e Bryan MacKenzie ( George Newbern ) , living an upper class with his parents in Bel-Air , but George tries to keep his feelings about wedding preparations and this new man in his daughter's life intact . But it is mainly the thought of never seeing his daughter again that gets to George the most , and it is only after a near cancellation ( over a blender ) that he understands he has to let go and reunites the happy couple . So the wedding day comes , George walks Annie up the aisle , and the rest of the day he can't even say his final goodbye before they leave for honeymoon , but at least she called him . Also starring Home Alone's Kieran Culkin ( Macaulay's brother ) as Matty Banks , Martin Short as Franck Eggelhoffer , B . D .

392,"Text1: Early Sam Peckinpah film is a real delight . This superb Western stars two legendary icons of the genre in Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea . McCrea is Steve Judd , aging former lawman who agrees to take a job transporting gold from a mining community to a small town . He acquires two traveling partners , first his old friend Gil Westrum ( Scott ) , who brings along brash youth Heck Longtree ( Ron Starr ) . Along the way , they meet young bride-to-be Elsa Knudsen ( Mariette Hartley ) , who runs away from overbearing , deeply religious father Joshua ( R . G . Armstrong ) . This second feature from Peckinpah is an elegant , methodically paced film . The script , credited to N . B . Stone , Jr . , is at once wistful ( Steve and Gil often reminisce about days gone by ) , humorous ( McCrea rides into town as a carnival gets under way , and acts as if the crowd has gathered for him ) , sentimental , and poetic , with some wonderful lines . It shares the theme of The Old West giving way to the new ( with Steve and Gil representing a sense of wisdom and experience , and Heck representing naive recklessness ) with other Westerns from the period , and comes across as a completely genuine , heartfelt ode to that era . It also explores that timeless subject of whether people can be truly either good or evil , and the fact that in general they fall somewhere in between . And , ultimately , it's a very nice tale of re-affirming one's basic sense of decency and honor . Lucien Ballards ' cinematography of the California wilderness is majestic , as is George Bassman's music . The two aged stars absolutely shine in superior roles ( sadly , this was Scott's final film ) with Starr and Hartley doing fine in representing the younger generation . Edgar Buchanan has a real standout scene as a judge , who despite his drunkenness , manages to deliver a very good speech about marriage and human nature . Armstrong is excellent as always . The antagonistic Hammond brothers are played by a great bunch of performers , including James Drury , John Davis Chandler , John Anderson , and future Peckinpah repertory players Warren Oates ( who's particularly funny as the comedy relief among them ) and L . Q . Jones . "" Ride the High Country "" tells a moving and effective tale in a fairly compact running time of 94 minutes . It's now motivated me to watch the other films in its celebrated director's repertoire as soon as possible .

Text2: Style over substance - but the style is good ! Before Peter Weir went on to make ' A ' class films such as The Dead Poets Society and Witness , he had a rather unsuccessful stint as a B-movie cult flick director . Despite the fact that he's become better known for his critically acclaimed films , his lesser cult films show much more imagination and are far more fun to watch . The Cars That Ate Paris works from a delicious premise . A small township in Australia named ' Paris ' causes car accidents and salvages valuables from the wreckages . The town's currency is radios , clothes etc and this lucrative business is doing well for the town . When someone survives a crash , they usually end up mentally disabled , which is good for the town as it stops them from being caught by the pesky insurance investigator . This is all well and good until George and brother Arthur drive into town . George is killed in the crash , but Arthur survives it ; pretty much unharmed . Nobody has ever left Paris before , which prompts the Mayor to take the young man into his family home . This is something that will go on to have massive repercussions on the township of Paris . . . Peter Weir deliciously blends several elements into the plot line . On one hand , we have the incredibly surreal idea of a whole town killing people for their valuables . This blends with the whole crazy cult idea , and this in turn mixes with the idea of the things that people will do to survive . Weir has speckled the movie with loads of great imagery , such as the old women who's job it is to take the valuables from the cars stuffing clothes down their top , and the devilish cornerstone of society , the Mayor , overseeing all the horror . Despite all the film's good elements , however , Weir has failed to make the film a complete whole . It may be down to inexperience , but while he's busy creating his atmosphere ; the characters have been forgotten about , and this makes it difficult to care for them , and the story beyond an aesthetic level . There is much to like about this movie , and it's definitely worth seeing for the imagery alone ; but it's hard to really love it , and that stops me from giving the film a high rating . I still recommend the movie , however , as it's well worth seeing .

394,"Text1: Just why did Shirley Temple's ex star in these kinds of movies ? My rating of course only applies because I assume that only ' 50s-B-movie fetishists would even take any interest in "" The Brain from Planet Arous "" . But previous reviewers have noted that this movie takes a slightly different approach : criminal brain Gor comes to earth to inhabit a man's body and thereby rule the universe , while police brain Vol arrives in search of the criminal brain ( meaning that most of the brains on Planet Arous are good guys ) . Therefore , even non-fetishists should take some interest in this movie . The characters are pretty much what one would expect : the men are all hot-headed , while the one woman is desperate . The main character Steve March is played by John Agar , aka Shirley Temple's first husband . I also saw him in "" Journey to the Seventh Planet "" ( although I paid slightly more attention to the hot babes in that one ) . Maybe he starred in ' 50s and ' 60s B-sci-fi movies because his reputation as Shirley Temple's ex limited his opportunities ( actually , I don't know whether that limited his opportunities ) . Also starring are Joyce Meadows as Steve's hubby Sally Fallon , Thomas Brown Henry as her father John , and Dale Tate as the voices of Gor and Vol . If this had ever gotten shown on "" MST3K "" , Mike or Servo or Crow probably would have said "" If Planet Arous has a brain , why didn't the people behind this movie ? "" But I personally didn't think find this a bad movie . Like any ' 50s sci-fi flick , you have to accept it for what it is .

Robin Williams was actually the best character , as a manic Russian gynecologist ( yeah , like an immigrant's really going to get to be a gynecologist in this country ) .

"" subtext running throughout "" Friday Night Lights "" - it's there in the pre and post game revelry ; it's there in the storefront "" Gone to the Game "" signs ; it's there in the radio talk show snippets that alternately proclaim and shred the embattled coach , and it's there in the memories of those who either once lived or who want to live the dream of winning a championship . When I view a film like "" Friday Night Lights "" I'm more interested in the characters and their motivation than in the outcome of the big game , and on this score the movie delivered in a big way . For Coach Gaines ( Billy Bob Thornton ) , winning the state championship is not an option , it's a matter of where he and his family will live next year . The followers of the Odessa-Permian Panthers take their football seriously , as do all the fans of all the football teams in all the towns of East and West Texas . In that regard , the movie realistically depicts the rabid and obsessive fervor that grips the town on game day after game day . For the players , it seems that there is no time to relax , and life outside of football is virtually non-existent . Team quarterback Mike Winchell ( Lucas Black ) is in the game because he has the talent , but it's never quite clear that he even likes to play . Running back Boobie Miles ( Derek Luke ) has an ingratiating charm , you'd like to smack him for his cockiness , but he puts points on the board . Receiver Don Billingsley ( Garrett Hedlund ) faces a tougher opponent at home than he ever sees on the football field , his father ( Tim McGraw ) is a one time football champion himself , who can't crawl out of bottle or the memories of his championship season . When Don drops a pass in practice , the father's reaction is one of rage and humiliation , so much for positive reinforcement . The movie follows the Permian Panthers on the way to the final state championship game with all the highs and lows , wins and losses in between . It's a harrowing ride , particularly after superstar Boobie blows out a knee , and refuses to face the reality of life without football . After all , this was to be his ticket to the big time , pro ball and all the trappings that go with being a football hero . The locker scene between halves of the championship game is a defining moment . Coach Gaines can get into his players like no one else can , and he finds just the right words to inspire his players to do the undoable . You just know how this game will end . Or do you ? For me , the movie succeeds in challenging the viewer to re-evaluate one's concept of winning and losing , knowing that when the game's over you have to be able to look your fellow players in the eye and know that you did everything you could for the team . And once the game is over , the game is over , there's no going back and no do-overs . In that respect , it's a lot like life .

Tedeschi is a fine actress and has illuminated many films with her quiet , understated beauty that leaves most of the ' glamor ' girls dead in the water . She doesn't make it easy on herself opting for an intricate storyline requiring both a large cast and ensemble playing and allegedly basing her screenplay loosely on her own life . If I were producing a screenplay that called for an actress who could convey guilt about being very wealthy convincingly I'd be unable to come up with anyone other that Bruni-Tedeschi . At close to forty she can still do gauche and make it come out charming and more than this she is able to extract equally fine performances from the likes of Yvan Attal , Denis Podalydes , Chiara Mastroianni and not least her own mother playing the mother of the fictional - but - lightly - based - on - Valeria herself Federica . She brings it off superbly and takes her rightful place alongside such other distinguished female directors as Agnes Varda , Diane Kurys , Ann Fontaine , and Agnes Jouai .

It's equally clear from the comments I've read - mostly from the USA - that not many people are fully conversant with the expression ' White ' Russian , which simply refers to members of the Russian aristocracy that came to an abrupt end in 1917 , after which date all Russians , whether or not active Revolutionists , were ' Red ' . So here we have ex-aristo Sophia ( Natasha Richardson ) roughing it with her titled family in Shanghai ; two of the family members are Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave both woefully underused especially Vanessa in a role that anyone just out of Acting School could have done standing on their head . Merchant-Ivory do themselves no favours by choosing to remind us of Casablanca ; whilst it's true that Natasha Richardson has inherited her all of her mother's heartbreaking beauty ( well , leave us not lose our heads , about 90 per cent of it ) it's equally true that the curiously wooden Fiennes is light years short of both Bogie's charisma and talent . There was more chemistry between Yassar Arafat and Golda Meir than between Fiennes and Richardson and when they ARE your love story then you got trouble , my friend , right here in River City .

The title on this one was "" The Gun and The Cross "" , close enough to the original to get the message across . The title character wields both , as Marjoe Gortner is revealed to be gunfighter Ernie Parsons , masquerading as a preacher after he finds a real one who was bushwhacked . Donning the clothes of the dead minister , he arrives at the town of Castle Walk just in time to help the local folk deal with nasty town boss Ross ( David Huddleston ) . It's fairly formulaic , with nods to 1952's "" High Noon "" and 1973's "" High Plains Drifter "" , along with a preview of 1985's "" Pale Rider "" . However with it's own spin on things , it comes across both interesting and entertaining , particularly with the inclusion of Pamela Sue Martin as Gortner's love interest . Their scenes together are played both for romance and camp value , and I got a kick out of Sally ( Martin ) explaining how she wouldn't be the youngest widow in town if Parsons were to meet his demise . Along with the principals , you have some fine supporting players doing character portrayals you might have seen before ; Slim Pickens as a sidekick of the preacher , Geoffrey Lewis as a hired gun , and Estelle Parsons , who starts out somewhat annoying as Sally's mom . but then settles down a bit to accept the preacher and his mission . The ending comes as just a bit of a surprise , and you have to fill in your own blanks as to the town's reaction , especially Sally's , when Gortner's character realizes Billy's ( Pickens ) advice is correct .

The International English title mentions the ' Conquest of Atlantis ' , and that probably makes more sense , but in the end , it's the destruction of Atlantis that takes center stage . There's an entire mythology offered by Zantas , the last high priest of Uranus , that explains what's going on with Antinea and her cohort of Grand Vizier clones . It involves the betrayal of Uranus and how at his death , his blood becomes a rock of power , which Antinea will use to become omnipotent . Only the rays of the sun can destroy the rock , so that clue is a preview as to how Hercules will save the day . Reg Park is the beefy Hercules in this film , probably the best known bodybuilder after Steve Reeves to don the mantle of Zeus ' son . The entire first half of the picture has him unusually resigned to his fate ; his buddy Androcles , the King of Thebes had him drugged so he could whisk him away to do battle against an unknown enemy . Herc's son Hylus was in on the scheme and tries to stay out of dad's sight as long as possible to avoid a Herculean butt kicking . One has to consider just how effective a king Androcles actually was . He's on a mission to save his kingdom , and not one warrior from Thebes accompanies him ; he had to man the ship with galley slaves and cutthroats . He mentions to Hercules that his senators didn't agree with him , but come on , he's the King ! At least Hercules was sharp enough to avoid being drugged a second time . When Antinea attempts to slip him a mickey , Herc fakes it so he can continue investigating the secrets of Atlantis . He had some fun earlier defeating the shape shifting Proteus who protected the island from the outside world . The other effect that caught my eye was when one of Antinea's ineffective soldiers got the ' House on Haunted Hill ' acid wash reducing him to a skeleton . I'd be curious to see the outtakes from this picture . How many times can you use the word ' Uranus ' before it starts to take it's toll on cast , crew and audience ? I'm sure by the time Atlantis blew up , Hercules was ready to say - ' you watch yours and I'll watch mine ' . And what about the captive women , er , woman ? Well she hooks up with Hylus on the voyage home , exchanging a major lip lock with Hercules ' son as they sail off into the sunset . All's well as Androcles comes out of his state of amnesia , and he doesn't remember a thing . As for Hercules , he shows just how powerful a son of a Greek god can be ; when he climbs aboard the ship after swimming to safety from Atlantis , he's as dry as a bone !

402,"Text1: The film's good , but Nero gives an uncharacteristically bad performance What do you do when you've been beaten , robbed , and kidnapped and you don't feel the police are doing enough to find those responsible for the crime ? If you're Carlo Antonelli ( Franco Nero ) you take matters into your own hands and go after the bad guys yourself . This is the basic premise of Enzo Castellari's Street Law . It's an action packed film with enough gun battles , car chases , and bloodshed to make the most ardent of fans happy . Some of the violence may seem a little far fetched , but that only adds to the fun . Castellari certainly has an eye for action sequences and films these scenes with some interesting camera work . The film does drag a bit during some of the more dialogue heavy scenes as Nero delivers another of his endless speeches railing against the police . The supporting cast is good with Giancarlo Prete giving a standout performance . The other name in the cast , Barbara Bach , is so underutilized that I forgot she was in the movie a couple of times . As hard as this may be to believe , Franco Nero is actually the weak link in Street Law . Some of his reaction shots are ridiculous . Nero's character gets the stuffing beat out of him several times in the film . During these beatings , Nero has a look of complete astonishment on his face as if he didn't realize these baddies were going to beat him up if he kept interfering with them . This is just one example , but Nero needlessly overacts in several other scenes throughout the film . I don't know if it was Nero's fault or if Castellari is to blame , but it hurts the film .


Text2: two-thirds of a fantastic dark comedy on the nature of sexual insanity , though not as successful as later Almodovar It's safe to say that even in a film by Pedro Almodovar that is only marginally successful within the margins there are some good , steamy , questionable times to be had . I can just imagine Pedro sitting in front of his notebook just figuring out ways to mix sex , film-making , kidnapping , and other lewd exercises into some kind of cohesive single film . What makes a very good chunk of Tie Me Up , Tie Me Down exciting satirically is that Almodovar never gives in to making anything TOO serious . Which is perhaps what ends up transitioning the situation Ricky ( Antonio Banderas ) and Marina ( Victoria Abril ) are in from the absurd and flirtingly masochistic to the ( ironically ) conventional and quasi-sweetness that is obviously deep in Almodovar . Perhaps the tying up and re-tying becomes part of a metaphor on the filmmaker's part , that despite it being something very dangerous and totally provocative it's also inviting in ways that would be elusive otherwise . Then again , that the material does ( mostly ) work , by being so disturbing in the bluntness and perpetually deranged mind-set of Ricky , but then in the human connections that are enhanced all the more . If only the motivations - even in such loose and wacky-Almodovar circumstances - were a little more convincing . Nevertheless , I liked a lot about Tie Me Up , Tie Me Down up until it goes off the rails with its logic turning into knots ( simply , I just don't buy that Marina falls for Ricky just like that , even if she was an ex-junkie porn star , and Ricky's advances are like that of a uppity , headstrong but shy 13 year old , a slight reminder of A Life Less Ordinary's bizarrely innocuous kidnapping turned romance ) . Chiefly , the performances and the usually arty-yet-trashy style from Almodovar and his crew . Banderas is , by the way , in one of his best and funniest performances here , a near emblem of the male ideal for a life with a woman , and a with an innocent yet fervent attraction to bondage , with that perfect look in his eyes detailing all even in brief moments . Yet there was something about his stay in the mental home all those years that did something to his ideas towards sex and what it is to live , and Banderas captures this mix of intense sadism crossed with the heart of an old Hollywood-studio leading man who will do anything to brush the leading lady off of her feet . Abril is always believable too , even when Almodovar gives her character a turn around into something more akin to an exploitation film , however sweet it tries to be . While she decides to underplay her immediate fear of her kidnapper , it works to add a level of comic timing to Ricky's own odd-ball ways . They make a great pair , really , especially when it comes to that ' turning point ' , where Almodovar uses his unique style to get five ceiling-mirrored shot of a pivotal scene . There's also a fantastic role of the director of the film Marina is starring in at the start of the film , the aged Maximo Espejo ( Francisco Rabal , who's been in countless films including the Eclipse and Belle de Jour ) , who has the ideas burning and changing around at a beat as to what his ending will be for his actress - death , being saved , something else ? His moments on screen display a richness that lies often in Almodovar's script , where the surreal pressures of shooting the movie for Maximo somewhat carry over - and sort of dissipate as the characters become vulnerable - into that realm where reality and un-reality cross paths . This is heightened , and made a little additionally conventional , by the musical score , which like many of Almodovar's work is a tip of the hat to Herrmann compositions and old Hollywood romantic classics . There's even an emotional upheaval when Ricky and Marina meet again on that balcony overlooking the vista . The wildest thing about the picture is that one does become absorbed in the push and pull relationship between ' kidnapper ' and ' kidnapee ' ( I quote that for its a little redundant to use those terms as the film goes on ) , and that these fed up people are practically the most average couple you'd ever","{""output"": ""NO""}"
403,"Text1: some cute moments but the movie just didn't work for me This movie was a minor picture with relatively low aspirations . Seen in this light , it's a fairly good picture but definitely one you'll probably forget soon after seeing it . Most of this is due to the difficult to believe chemistry between John Wayne and Jean Arthur and the rest is due to the pretty ordinariness of the plot . Jean is besought by suitors back East . She needs a break and meets up with rodeo star Wayne and is almost instantly smitten . However , despite a good start , things run amiss and it appears that nice girl Jean won't get her man . But , this being a Hollywood picture of the 1940s , then you KNOW it's a cinch it will all work out in the end . This picture probably did nothing to either help or hinder either actors ' career , but it lacked believably chemistry and plausibility . Absolutely no surprises but a pleasant diversion nonetheless . By the way , a very similar movie is THE COWBOY AND THE LADY starring Gary Cooper and Merle Oberon . It also earns a 6 but I must admit that this John Wayne and Jean Arthur film is just a tad better , so if you MUST see one , see LADY TAKES A CHANCE .


Text2: From The Famous Astin-Martin To The Rocket Belt To The Q-Boat & More Instead of showing all of the wild James Bond gadgets throughout his long film series , this program concentrated on 5-7 items ( but did mention others ) . The writers decided to break it down into five major categories : 1 - cars ; 2 - boats ; 3 - guns ; 4 - flying machines and 5 - covert spy gadgets . The car segment was focused on , as they said , "" the most famous car in the world . "" That would be the Astin Martin DB5 , made famous in "" Goldfinger . "" That was the auto which had machine guns in it , oil slick apparatus and other goodies never seen on screen before . We also see another really nice car from "" Goldfinger "" - the expensive "" Rolls Royce Phantom 3 . "" The featured boat is the sleek "" Q Boat , "" named after that eccentric maker of Bond gadgets in his movie , "" Q . "" We go to the USA Midwest and witness a demonstration of the boat and what it can do on the Kankakee River . Not many speedboats can go 80 mph and have 350 horsepower with a such a light load . It was seen in "" The World Is Not Enough . "" Later , we see other boats that were in other Bond films . The gun segment was mainly showing how guys are trained at a special tactical training school in the art of everything you see Bond do : fighting skills , weaponry , flying , boating , you name it . It's pointed out that no one in the world can learn all of these skills at an extremely high level ( but James Bond , of course ! ) Two flying machines are featured : the "" Rocket Belt , "" first designed and tested at Textron Corporation in Buffalo , New York , in the late ' 50s and early ' 60s , and then the "" Auto Gyro , "" a small helicopter-type machine that can be used anywhere . The "" Rocket Belt "" has been demonstrated all over the world . Put simply , a man puts this apparatus on , which is like a back pack , and - zoom - he's up in the air flying . The few men that have been trained to do this over the years are interviewed and seen from tests to performing at big events like the Super Bowl . Eighty-five year old inventor and flying of the Auto Gyro is Ken Wallis , who tells us and shows us what his cool machine does . "" Little Nell "" was the name of one of these flying machines , the one you might have seen in "" You Only Live Twice . "" Finally , we go to a store in Beverly Hills , Ca . , where a man demonstrates some of the gadgets they have in their "" Counter Spy Shop . "" These things are incredible , but seemed to me to be most valuable to crooks and cops , not everyday people . They have machines that can tell you if someone is in your house wearing "" a wire ; "" voice machines that can tell you if someone over the phone is lying ; whether your phones are being tapped ; machines to change your voice and see through walls , etc . , etc .

The footage is of poor quality and of little interest . In the beginning , as the commentator talks about Hollywood glamor and the beautiful people , there is a clip of three men standing outside of the Oscars - all unrecognizable , and one of them looks like Dwight D .

There are no clips from movies . Everything shown is from press conferences or premiers , or events where the press was present , and the film quality is uniformly bad .

Clark Gable is included ( along with some interesting news - he won an Oscar for Gone With the Wind ) ; Gary Cooper is not .

Text2: Excellent look at the granddaddy of sports scandals David Straithairn , D . B . Sweeney , John Cusack , Charlie Sheen , James Read , Don Harvey , Gordon Clapp and Michael Rooker are "" Eight Men Out "" in this John Sayles movie about the throwing of the 1919 World Series by the Chicago White Sox . It's another pathetic story of how money can corrupt even usually honest people . The film shows that part of the reason the players caved was that their boss , Charles Comiskey ( Clifton James ) underpaid his team and worse than that , was a welsher , making unkept promises to get good performances out of the players . Sadly , Buck Weaver ( Cusack ) refused to throw any games but was accused anyway , and spent the rest of his life trying to clear his name . "" Say it ain't so , Joe , "" spoken by a young boy to Shoeless Joe Jackson , demonstrates the hero worship these men enjoyed from the public - which is one reason why they were found not guilty . An independent commissioner , however , banned them from baseball for life . John Sayles has done a terrific job both on the screenplay and in his direction of these fine actors . Though this was a low-budget movie , it looks like a big studio film all the way , and the dramatization of the events keeps you hooked : the casual way Lefty Williams ' wife's life is threatened if the next game isn't lost ; the poor circumstances under which Buck Weaver and his wife lived - just think of the players today ; Joe Jackson putting an X on his witness statement , unable to write and many other moments . Sayles takes his time leading up to the actual trial , giving great detail about what led up to the throwing of the games . So many screenwriters today have lost the art of the build-up - not Sayles . Getting to the point in the first five minutes isn't as important to him as character and story development . It's rare , and he's to be commended . Standout performances come from David Straithairn as pitcher Eddie Cicotte , who would never have gone along had not Comisky reneged on his bonus . Straithairn is one of the finest actors today , and his guilt , suppressed anger and unhappiness permeated his performance all the way through the film . John Mahoney is great as Gleason , the manager , who can't hide his disappointment but in the end , sticks up for his players ; Michael Lerner as the disgusting Arnold Rothstein , portrayed as a discourteous man who likes to throw his large weight around ; and of course , John Cusack , who has heartbreak reading on his face as he desperately tries to play his best game while his teammates seek to throw it . The players never saw all of the money they were promised . Instead of going into the record books as outstanding players , they went in as crooks , all for a couple of thousand dollars . They learned the hard way that some things - - such as your reputation and honesty - are more important than money . Unfortunately , some of today's players still haven't learned that hard lesson .

405,"Text1: takes on the egotistical qualities in artists - and gangsters - in Allen's very funny send-up of Broadway Now this is something sort of rare , though not really : Woody Allen mixing satire and drama , and the satire actually even more convincing than the drama . The opposite was in a more serious affair , Crimes and Misdemeanors , where art and murder and infidelities all get into one big pot of personality crises . This is the same case with Bullets Over Broadway , though this time Allen's tackling of the ego-maniacal crutches of the Broadway scene - the aging star Helen Sinclair ( Dianne Wiest , one of her very best performances , funniest too ) , the bumbling boob Olive Neal ( Jennifer Tilly , appropriately annoying - and then how it sort of infects the outsiders to the major Broadway scene , one the protagonist David Shayne ( John Cusack , excellent here ) , and Olive's bodyguard , Cheech ( Chazz Palminteri , a character he could play in his sleep , but played pretty well anyway ) . Cheech is hanging around during rehearsals of David's first play he's writing and directing , following getting funding ( on the condition of Olive as a psychiatrist ) from a heavy-duty mobster , and soon he's suggesting ideas , and in the process becomes David's uncredited collaborator . But meanwhile infidelities are abound , with David falling for the wonderfully self-indulgent Helen , and a goofy romance between Olive and the thespian Warner Purcell ( Jim Broadbent ) , leading to a purely ironic climax . Allen's skills at navigating the neuroses of all the characters is very skilled , and sometimes the one-liners are surprisingly funny , all based on the personalities ( Wiesst especially , in a voice that is a little startling at first , gives a classic line about the world ' opening ' up , and her running gag with "" don't speak "" ) . Even with the more dramatic connections , which doesn't seem to be as much of Allen's concerns since it's pretty one-note with the mob side of things ( and , frankly , the fates of Olive and Cheech sort of seem a little too contrived for the sake of the irony par for the course ) , we do get a very memorable bit to make things worth the while , like David and Cheech's down to earth talk at the bar . But if there's anything else to recommend more strongly it's for the sharpness of the script in the theater scenes , the backstage banter , the hilarious tension stirred up by grudges and ill-timed romances . Plus , there's a bit of an added treat for fans of past Allen films , where he casts Rob Reiner in a role sort of similar to that of Wallace Shawn in Manhattan . Not a masterpiece , but a very enjoyable work that's successful on its dark-light terms .

406,"Text1: Someone's been watching Rear Window ! I've heard some really good things about this film , so it didn't surprise me that it didn't quite live up to expectations . Someone's Watching Me is an early TV movie from so-so director John Carpenter and it was released in the same year that his biggest hit - slasher flick Halloween - was released , so I'm guessing that a lot of the praise for this film comes from John Carpenter fans . This would appear to be Carpenter's attempt at a Brian De Palma-style Hitchcock tribute , and the main influence here is obviously Hitchcock's masterpiece , ' Rear Window ' . Naturally , the film has nothing on Hitchcock and could really be described as a poor man's impression of the classic film ; but thankfully , Carpenter doesn't just copy and the result is an interesting take on an already well done theme . The plot focuses on a female TV director who finds herself being watched through a telescope by a man in the block across from her . Not to content to just watch , the man also terrifies her by calling her up . She tells the cops , but as usual there's nothing they can do - so she takes to investigating herself , along with her new found boyfriend and a lesbian who works at the same TV station . I have to say that I'm not the biggest fan of John Carpenter's body of work ; but this film actually represents one of his biggest successes . The film works thanks to the way that the writer / director manages to keep things at least mostly interesting throughout , and while the film doesn't boast too many real biting sequences , it at least never stagnates to the point of tedium . The Rear Window influence is felt throughout , and one pivotal sequence is pretty much lifted from the earlier film . However , most of the movie is original , and so I wouldn't go as far as to call this a complete rip off . The film was made for television in the seventies , but all this really means is that there's a lack of bloodshed ( which the story doesn't really need anyway ) as the production values and acting are decent enough for this sort of film . I have to say that I'd have liked this film more if Carpenter could have worked a bit more mystery into the proceedings , as the identity of the tormentor is never really important , and that's a shame as it could have added an extra element of interest if the director was willing to go a little further . Still , the film ends well ( if a little abruptly ) , and since it runs smoothly throughout , I have to give a thumbs up .


Text2: Giant underground worms , a barrel of laughs and some very nifty special effects - monster movie masterclass ! Tremors was one of my all time favourite movies as a kid , but since then ; only my nostalgia for the film has remained . Upon seeing the film for the first time as an adult , it immediately hit me that I had great taste even as a child . Despite being an overblown and silly monster movie at heart - Tremors is a damn good film . The thing about Tremors that stands out the most is definitely the special effects . While none of them are particularly impressive individually - together , they combine to brilliantly create the illusion that the small town of ' Perfection ' really is under attack from giant subterranean worms ! Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward take the lead roles as a couple of handymen , living out of a truck , that decide they want to move up in the world . A local , and larger , town is their desired destination ; but before they can exit Perfection , they uncover a lot of strange events . Severed heads in a pool of blood , a dehydrated man atop a telephone tower and , best of all , a car that's been dragged underground - radio still playing ! Along with a college student called Rhonda , it doesn't take our heroes long to realise that their quiet Nevada town is infested with giant underground worms ! The main reason why Tremors works so well is because it follows the same plot formula as the classic monster movies such as ' Them ! ' . This makes the film predictable ; but when the plotting is this much fun , it really doesn't matter . Adding massively to the entertainment value are the two leading men . Their conversations are constantly funny , and ensure that the film is never boring for a second . Typically for this sort of film ; almost all of the residents of Perfection like to spend their spare time doing things that make vibrations - bouncing basket balls , driving tractors , playing with pogo sticks etc ; but even this unlikely situation can be forgiven due to the extreme good nature of the movie . The characters on display are really great , the best of them being Burt Gummer , played by Michael Gross . Complete with his basement full of guns and wife who's just as nuts as him ; Gross steals every scene he's in . Something that's often ignored in films like this is the writing . Writers S . S . Wilson and Brent Maddock have put together an excellent story , complete with all the suspense , inventiveness and laughs that you could ever want . On the whole , Tremors is a cut above the average monster flick !

Although it is a true story , the facts it depicts were risqu√© and its plea for the right to be different has a contemporary feel . Ren√© F√©ret's directing was certainly influenced by that of Robert Bresson , but he occasionally shows a certain warmth which the master never allows himself . Circa 1850 : Alexina who spent her youth in a completely female world ( a convent , then a training college ) becomes a schoolteacher in a small village . She feels she's different . She does not have her periods . Worse , she falls in love with her colleague ( a woman of course ) . Pretty soon , they become lovers , as Alexina feels more and more the man in her / him . But one of their pupils ( it recalls Wyler's "" the children's hour "" ; the difference is that here it is a true rumor ) reveals theirrelationship . Alexina loses her job and has a physical exam . It would seem that she is an hermaphrodite . There's the rub . The nineteenth century society is not prepared to accept such a "" monster "" . Victor , "" the wild child "" ( see Truffaut's movie ) was not dangerous for the society-he had appeared earlier in the century - because he was sexless and not really clever . Alexina wants to marry her / his lover . But the world in which she lives is still dominated by religion and puritanism . The biology lesson is revealing : when she tells her pupils about the frog reproduction , Alexina does not mention that the male inseminates the eggs ( and however it happens in the water ) .

410,"Text1: Somewhat routine feeling third Psycho film . Psycho III starts about a month after the tragic events of Psycho II ( 1983 ) as Norman Bates ( Anthony Perkins ) tries to carry on with his slightly unstable life , he even hires a guy named Duane Duke ( Jeff Fahey ) to help him around the motel . Then a disillusioned nun named Maureen Coyle ( Diana Scarwid ) who has lost her faith in God drifts into the motel & hires a room , that night Maureen tries to commit suicide by slitting her wrists but while delivering fresh towels to her room Norman gets to her in time & saves her life . Meanwhile nosey journalistic reporter Tracy Venable ( Roberta Maxwell ) becomes increasingly suspicious of Norman's behaviour & with Emma Spool still missing Tracy believes Norman is up to his old ways & becomes determined to prove it . . . The second sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's original Psycho ( 1960 ) I personally think Psycho III doesn't have that much going for it , Universal allowed Norman Bates himself Anthony Perkins to direct & star in this & to be fair he isn't the problem . No , it's the lacklustre script by Charles Edward Pogue . With Psycho II writer Tom Holland turned in a really clever , intricate psycho thriller with some genuine twist's & turns that will keep most viewers guessing right up until the very end & threw in just enough 80's exploitation like gore & nudity to make it fun . However for Psycho III you can forget about any clever narrative , any surprising twist's or any real mystery . It's far too obvious who the killer is & while Psycho II mercifully realised showing Anthony Perkins in drag dressed as his mother complete with wig would just not work & would look frankly ridiculous that's precisely what happens here in Psycho III . Anthony Perkins in drag is not scary or creepy or clever & to me feels very lazy in a ' lets have Norman as the killer because it's the easiest & simplest thing to do ' sort of way . It's not a totally terrible film though , the pace is alright , there's some nice gore & nudity here , the character's are fine & some of the black humour & one liners are OK & even though it's a bit uninspired it does fit in quite well as a Psycho film . Apparently Perkins wanted to shoot Psycho III in black and white but Universal quite rightly told him to forget it . The ending was also the subject of some changing , Universal felt the ending was too weak & it needed more of a twist so Perkins was brought back in to shoot some moire footage although I am not sure where the film originally ended & what new footage was shot . It is also said that in the original script Duane Duke was the killer . There are one or two nice murders here including some stabbings & a cool slit throat . The film looks pretty good & Perkins does OK with some nice lighting , angles & shots . Production wise Psycho III looks pretty much the same as the previous two as again it's almost entirely set within the Bates Motel & it's grounds . The acting is alright , no-one really stands out for me here . Psycho III isn't as good as the previous two films but it ain't too bad when all things considered , worth a watch but it's lacking a little something overall I think .


Text2: Unwatchable between the fight scenes ; not much better during them The only possible source of entertainment in a movie like "" Bloodfight "" is the fighting , but even that is spoiled here by terrible direction , bad camera angles and sloppy editing . The plot rambles on for about an hour , then turns into a tenth-rate "" Rocky "" . The Oriental actors , burdened with someone's idiotic decision that they should all speak exclusively in English ( in a misconceived attempt to help the film break more easily into the American market , perhaps ? ) , recite their lines robotically , without any feeling . On the other hand , the white actors , who can speak English more fluently , can't act ( only Cristina Lawson comes close to doing both of those things simultaneously ) . "" Bloodfight "" is only for those who'll watch Bolo Yeung in any film , no matter how atrocious it may be . ( )

Text2: Strike Up The Bland Despite a reasonably varied output Jacques Demy is destined to be remembered by film buffs as the onlie begetter of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and by admirers of Cole Porter , Larry Hart , Frank Loesser , Johnny Mercer etc as the William MacGonigall of lyricists , indeed Demy established something of a record in the number of banal lyrics he has committed to celluloid . Defenders will argue that in creating ' sung-through ' musicals he was not looking for extractable hit songs ( though in English translations two did emerge from Cherbourg ) . That first musical was bittersweet albeit brightly lit whereas this last entry is much more dark as reflected in the sombre reds and blues . Set against a strike it all ends in tears but along the way Danielle Darrieux , and Richard Berry weigh in with some fine work . Definitely watchable .

412,"Text1: Welcome to Sherwood , my lady ! If there is any film that Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland will be remembered for ( as screen partners ) it's ' The Adventures of Robin Hood ' . It has become one of the most beloved storybook films of all time - - action , romance , majestic sets and music , a sparkling script with many juicy lines and all of the swashbuckling swordplay done with great flourish and style . The highlight of the many action scenes is the duel between Flynn and Rathbone as they overturn heavy tables and candelabra , all the while exchanging some blustery dialogue . As for Flynn and de Havilland , their screen chemistry was never more obvious . Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone make a memorable pair of villains and the remarkable cast includes sterling performances from Melville Cooper , Ian Hunter , Una O'Connor , Alan Hale , Eugene Palette , Montagu Love and Patric Knowles . It's a fairytale version all done up in gleaming technicolor , the action and romance made even more impressive by Korngold's exquisite Oscar-winning score . The romantic highlight is the scene in Marian's bedchamber , a Romeo-and-Juliet-like moment with Flynn climbing a vine to her balcony to woo his damsel in distress . The archery tournament sequence is a joy to behold - - and de Havilland was never more beautifully photographed than in her reaction close-ups as she realizes the tournament is a trap . Una O'Connor is a joy as her loyal servant and Alan Hale makes a wonderful Little John . In fact , all of the supporting roles are perfectly cast . Rousing entertainment that has charmed the socks off everyone since its release in 1938 and outclasses the Kevin Costner version in every way possible . Long live the bandit of Sherwood Forest ! ! And last but not least , Erich Wolfgang Korngold's classic score remains one of the finest film scores ever , sweeping , majestic and always complimenting the on-screen action and romance . The new Ultra-Resolution process on the 2-Disc DVD gives an image that is probably better than when actually released in 1938 , when it opened to rave reviews at Radio City Music Hall .


Text2: Dark exploration of man's inhumanity to man . . . Despite all the realism depicted in THE GREY ZONE amid the actual day to day operations of a Nazi prison camp , there's a certain stage quality in the dialog that serves as a reminder that you're watching the screen version of a stage play and not what should seem more like a true life documentary . That's the fault of the script taken from David Mamet's play and other eye-witness sources - - but the acting is excellent . And yet , it does manage to convey just how those prison camps used other prisoners to operate the gas chambers , to carry out the deed with false promises - - "" Just be sure to remember where you hook the clothes so you can pick up your belongings when you leave "" - - and the backbreaking jobs of loading trucks with dead bodies and depositing them on chutes that go directly into a blazing furnace . Amid all this , various stories are entwined involving the petty quarrels among the men assigned to these tasks so they could prolong their own lives for at least four months of assured survival . The story involving a girl who does not die during the twenty-minute gassing and is then revived and how the men argue over how to protect her from further harm , is intense and touching in that it shows the humanity that is still in their souls . Her story and how it ends is one of the film's most memorable and touching elements . This is more of an in depth look at "" the final solution "" than any other recent films dealing with the extermination of Jews has ever been , with the exception of SCHINDLER'S LIST and THE PIANIST in which the accent was more on the triumph of the human spirit and a much broader view of the war itself in epic mode . This is a darker , intimate look at the actual operation of the camps as experienced by a handful of prisoners - - the brutality , the torture , and raises the question : how far would you go to survive ? It also shows how not all the Jews were as passive about their fate as some have claimed , often opposing the Nazi officers and paying for it with their lives . In the hands of a greater director , it might have been an even more impressive film than it is , so that I'm unable to place it in the same class with the two films mentioned above . The cast is uniformly good , but HARVEY KEITEL is outstanding as an SS Commander keeping strict tabs on the camp's hard-working doctor . In its own way , it's just as important . Young students of history would be well advised to view this one for a better understanding of how "" the final solution "" was supposed to occur and the methods used to carry out an enormous project known as "" the holocaust "" .

414,"Text1: THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR ( Vernon Sewell , 1967 ) Peter Cushing used to refer to THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR as the worst film of his prolific career , and this was enough to keep me from getting the SE DVD of it on R2 from DD Video when I purchased four more second-tier British horrors from the same outfit last year - namely , ISLAND OF TERROR ( 1966 ) , NIGHT OF THE BIG HEAT ( 1967 ) , CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR ( 1968 ) and THE CREEPING FLESH ( 1973 ) . Eventually , it was shown last Saturday night on an Italian TV channel in its original language with forced Italian subtitles , and I really couldn't let an occasion like that pass me by . . . Tigon was always seen as a cut-rate Hammer and this film was clearly inspired by the latter's THE REPTILE ( 1966 ; one of the Bray Studio outfit's best of the decade , and which THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR can't hope to match ) - where , again , we find a female monster ' created ' by her eminent but misguided entomologist father ( Robert Flemyng ) . The monster design ( we're dealing with a giant Death's Head Moth here ) isn't too bad , actually , and it's thankfully not over-exposed during the course of the film : besides , Wanda Ventham's character is interesting in that she doesn't bemoan her fate as usually happens in such genre efforts - rather , she's single-minded in seeking out her prey among Flemyng's na√Øve students and rugged helpers around the estate , all of whom are easily swayed by her attractiveness ! Aided by a fine score from resident Tigon composer Paul Ferris , the film creates a reasonable Gothic atmosphere throughout ( with , at one point , even an amateur rendition / parody of a typical Grand Guignol performance set up by the students - and also featuring Ventham - in Flemyng's house ) . The script , incidentally , is by Hammer alumnus Peter Bryan ( THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES [ 1959 ] , THE BRIDES OF Dracula [ 1960 ] and THE PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES [ 1966 ] ) and , while offering no real surprises , it's quite enjoyable for what it is - certainly better than its reputation would suggest ! That said , the monster's come-uppance in an unconvincing and abrupt fiery ending is one of the lamest of its kind I've ever come across . . . Cushing - with his customary fastidiousness and dry wit intact - is always a pleasure to watch ; Flemyng , too , offers his unhinged medico routine - and it's interesting , to say the least , to witness this clash of Hammer and Italian horror acting styles ! Notable among the supporting cast is Roy Hudd as a scurrilous morgue attendant . At this stage , I don't know whether I'll eventually spring for the R2 DVD - since it contains a 25-minute career overview with Ventham - but , if it's ever discounted again by one of my British retailers of choice ( and provided that it hasn't gone out-of-print by then ! ) , it's worth considering . Another DD Video title I've long neglected is THE DEVIL'S MEN ( 1976 ) , incidentally , also starring Peter Cushing - and , even though it's an equally maligned horror effort , I have to admit that I'm a sucker for such things . . .

I now realize and understand the dislike shared between Captain Crawford ( Alec Guinness ) and Lieutenant Scott-Padget played by Dirk Bogarde . At that young age , the two things I remembered the most was the scene where sailors were given maggot infested bread to eat and the ' cod pieces ' the officers wore .

What they and their henchmen have been doing is rustling cattle by the horde , or by the herd , whichever you prefer . Then they run the stolen cattle across the Mexican border , rebrand them , and filter them back into the states to sell at a profit . Many honest ranchers and small cattlemen get shot up in the process . Errol Flynn was one of them , his ranch destroyed , his cattle driven off , and he himself shot full of holes . A friend , John Litel , seeks him out in his Hollywood-style Mexican village where he finds Flynn now completely recovered and in possession of a ledger that proves Kelly's guilt . Also , need it be pointed out , Flynn is as gay and cheerful as ever . Flynn and Litel now set out for Texas to see to it that Kelly and Francen pay their debt to society . The rest of the plot gets complicated . Alexis Smith , gorgeous in Technicolor , enters the picture along with S . Z . ( "" Cuddles "" ) Sakall . The first is beautiful , the latter is less funny than silly , though the tastes of contemporary audiences may be responsible for that impression . Poor Litel is shot unawares by Francen . It does not come as a surprise . We know as soon as we meet his character that he is dead meat . The smoothly groomed miscreants steal the ledger or the diary or the MacGuffin or whatever it is - - the evidence . Flynn has to do a bit of shooting to get it back . He gets it back . The bad guys die . The rest of the good guys live . It's not a demanding film . It goes down like a double caf√© latte mit Schlag . None of the characters is in the least ambiguous . We never feel sorry for a moment when the bad guys get it . And the good guys have no qualifying quirks . They're all good-natured heterosexuals . I kept wishing for some surprise - - maybe Flynn could open his closet and a copy of Pepys ' diary would tumble out with all the ribald passages underlined . Anything . But , as it stands , the movie , though a bit slow , is enjoyable . The whole Warners factory was at work here . All the expected supporting players are present . The score is by Warners stalwart Max Steiner . How he could write so MANY scores for so MANY movies of different genres is a mystery . Flynn is fine as his usual casual self . He's casual even in action scenes . In the 1937 "" The Adventures of Robin Hood , "" he interrupted a sword fight with the menacing Basil Rathbone to wisecrack . "" Did I upset your plans ? "" Here , he faces down gunman Tom Tyler . They both draw and shoot , and Flynn asks wryly , "" Something wrong , McClaine ? "" Tyler , by the way , then does a reprise of his pre-mortem performance in "" Stagecoach . "" He drops one of his guns , turns and begins to walk slowly away , drops the other gun , takes a few more steps and drops dead . The superb photography is by Bert Glennon . Alexis Smith is merely decorative , but she IS decorative . S . Z . Sakall , a Hungarian , mangles the syntax of the English language and slaps his blubbery cheeks with his palms when he's frightened , which is most of the time , but his role is perhaps more dramatic than his persona can handle . I genuinely enjoyed the wardrobe and the art direction . San Antonio really looks glamorously Mexican . And the director has Victor Franken at varying times chewing on a tamale and what appears to be a soft taco . I've often wondered , though , about the livelihood of characters like Flynn's .

There's some lousy back projection ( but all Hitchcock films have that ) and I was never really sure WHAT the bad guys were doing ( something to do with microfilm ) . Also I've never believed Grant's actions when someone is killed in front of him ( WHY did he grab the knife ? ) . But the film is so incredibly entertaining no one has ever cared . This has some of Hitchcock's most famous scenes - - the infamous "" crop dusting "" sequence and the climax on top of Mount Rushmore - - but the whole film is just as good . There's a tense auction sequence and Grant's harrowing car ride down a treacherous road while dead drunk . There are some amusing parts in the film : Grant's mother appears to be a few years YOUNGER than him ; the main villains last name is Vandamm ; the romantic sparring between Grant and Eva Marie Saint is full of sexual innuendo ; Martin Landau ( one of Vandamm's henchman ) is gay ( he says he has a woman's intuition and has slightly exaggerated mannerisms - - but it's not offensively done ) and get a load of Vandamms mountain house at the end ! Grant appears a bit old for this but he pulls it off ; Eva Marie Saint is incredibly beautiful and pretty good as the love interest ( sort of ) ; Martin Landau is so young and handsome with blazing blue eyes and James Mason is just perfect as the evil Vandamm - - his lines seem to come so effortlessly and he's so suave . . . but you also see the cruelty hiding underneath .

417,"Text1: Great slice of underrated ( dark ) film-making from a cinematic genius I don't know why everyone thinks "" After Hours "" ends happily . This is a brooding , dark , bitter film , with a pessimistic outlook on life and a downright depressing core message . It is a "" comedy "" with no laughs , and few chuckles . It is also a great cult film by director Martin Scorsese that came and went in 1985 with little attention . It's surprising to see that Scorsese took on another comedy so shortly after his major flop , The King of Comedy ( 1983 ) , starring Robert De Niro . Scorsese publicly acknowledged that he wished he had never made The King of Comedy and his star disowned it . It was a film so far ahead of its time , no one understood it ? or much less , cared to see it . Thank goodness this did not dissuade Scorsese from making another comedy . He was back two years later with After Hours , which is an intense , hellish , nightmarish odyssey through New York City's Soho late at night , and into the morning . The film's protagonist , Paul ( Griffin Dunne ) , is an unlikable character who generally gains sympathy with us only because of his grueling misfortunes . Fate , it seems , has a grudge against poor Paul ; as the night progresses , it only becomes worse and worse , until he is running away from a bloodthirsty mob and happens to inadvertently witness a random murder . "" I'll probably get blamed for that , "" he says to himself , which is exactly what we're thinking . This really is the sort of film that makes you almost want to stop watching , it is so painful . Nothing at all goes right for Paul . When he seeks comfort in a friend , he is relieved , finally able to sit back and take a breath of air - - only to look outside and see his "" friend "" alerting the bloodthirsty mob . The plot ? what little there is ? begins in a typical daytime office setting . Paul meets a girl after a hard day at work ( Rosanna Arquette ) and they arrange to meet later that evening . On the way there he loses all his cash through the open window of a speeding taxicab and is left with few dollars . On top of this , Paul soon realizes that Arquette is not his type and leaves to go home ? only to find that local subway fare has been raised and he doesn't have enough cash to make it back to his apartment . Thus begins his nightmare . Scorsese's genius move here is that as Paul progresses onwards into the night , the film slowly loses its balance and topples over into a distinct category of weirdness . The beginning is fairly standard and realistic . It is typical Scorsese with exterior shots of New York City , character-driven dialogue and so on and so forth . About of the way through it becomes a bizarre Terry Gilliam-esquire hell ride and Scorsese lets loose on everything . It's brilliant film-making and a devastating satire of New York's late-night underbelly . The original ending ( storyboarded but never filmed ) involved Paul being reborn after crawling through a random woman's legs ? that's how bizarre , and creative , this film actually is . Dunne is suitable in the role of Paul ? a fairly unknown character actor ; he doesn't have the charisma or talent to be a typical leading man . Which , I think , is part of the reason he seems so comfortable in the role of Paul , who is certainly one of cinema's most unusual heroes . Another film might setup Paul as a meek , hard-working , likable guy who gets stuck in bad situations ? when in fact Paul is a confident jerk who probably deserves what is coming to him . Before picking up Arquette he flirts with her roommate ( Linda Fiorentino ) and gives her a back massage . He puts the moves on Arquette , then ditches her when she resists . He's not shy and he's not an all-around good guy ? he's a flawed character that only helps the entire experience feel more realistic . Scorsese is at the top of his game here . Many techniques would be used five years later in GoodFellas . Note the ringing phone and the abrupt lunge forward ; the keys being tossed out of the window in first-person perspective ; the rotating camera

Valerio believes that the idea of a supernatural evil force lurking in the convent ran by Mother Vincenza ( Franca Stoppi ) is pure rubbish , instead seeking a demented psychopath amongst them , committing murders . What Valerio doesn't realize is that Vincenza is in league with Satan , having cavorted with the lord of darkness , hiding their female spawn in the attic of the convent . The nuns under Vincenza's watch have been driven to fear , with many of them overcome by demonic possession . . any opposing threats , such as the elder Father Inardo ( Andrea Aureli ) who tries to use the rites of exorcism in cleansing the nunnery of it's evil , are destroyed . Vincenza will do whatever it takes to keep anyone from taking her daughter away . In other words , Valerio has a spiritual and physical battle on his hands . Bruno Mattei mentioned in an interview for the DVD release of "" The Other Hell "" that this flick was remastered from an obscure 16 mm print , having been a flop during it's initial release and abandoned . I guess , even though it's such a bizarre demonic horror nunsploit that often lacks in coherency opting to blindside the viewer with unhinged behavior and gory violence , that we should be somewhat thankful that this film can be seen at all . I can sure say it wasn't boring . Franca Stoppi sure lets it all hang out as the evil Mother Superior , wielding a knife at the end ready to viciously stab anyone that got in her way . There's this witches ' den with a burning cauldron , coffins containing murdered nuns , a slab for "" wicked nuns who committed sinful atrocities "" where we actually see one dead corpse get her innards plucked , laboratory tubes and flasks bubbling with liquid , etc . There's this cool tunnel leading to the den containing rows of skulls , kind of a "" cryptic "" form of art . We actually see a possessed nun tormented by blood-oozing stigmatic attack . The priest , Father Inardo is set on fire in his attempts to exorcise the nunnery . We see Franco Garofalo's grounds-keeper / animal wrangler / cook Boris ' hand covered in maggots and bitten by a dog . . he's later attacked in the throat by an unleashed dog . We see an actual rooster beheaded for later din-din . Vincenza and Satan's spawn lives in a small room where dolls and mannequins hang from the neck . We see a previous Mother Superior actually attempting to boil Vincenza's infant daughter in a pot on a stove ( . . and for goofy effect , which might have many chuckling with glee , Vincenza's infant , clearly a doll , telepathically murders the Mother Superior ) . Plenty of audacious moments on display certainly to entertain those craving the twisted delights Mattei and writer Claudio Fragasso churn out in doses . I guess this is probably Mattei's best film . . quite an outrageous concoction of surreal and horrific images . I think it , if anything , will entertain those that are not offended by the blasphemous material . The Goblin score , used from Buio Omega , somehow actually works in this film .

CIA director , Paul Devereaux , upon knowing how Dexter has found out about the war criminal , sends his henchman Frank McBride to eliminate Cal Dexter for him . Little does this corrupt government official realize the former Viet Nam veteran is ahead of all the evil forces and how he will avenge the murdered youth . The film , which was made for television , is based on a Frederick Forsyth novel . Director Robert Markowitz , working on the screen treatment by Alan Sharp delivers a taut action movie .

419,"Text1: After you , Alphonse . . . Marcel Aym√© ( pronounced ' Ah-may ' ) was France's equivalent to Thorne Smith . Aym√© wrote fantasy stories which , like Smith's , tended to feature unobtrusive men whose lives are irrevocably changed by an unexpected encounter with the supernatural , not always ending happily but usually with a bit of sex along the way . There are also distinct similarities between Aym√©'s works and the stories of James Thurber . Some of Aym√©'s best stories , intriguingly , were written during the Nazi occupation . ( This is especially evident in his bitter story ' La Carte ' . ) My own favourite Aym√© tale is ' La Grace ' , about an ordinary man - a decent individual , but hardly a candidate for sainthood - who suddenly finds himself equipped with an unwanted halo . Desperate to get rid of this inconvenience , he proceeds to commit every imaginable sin . . . but can't get rid of that halo . The French television programme ' Theatre Tonight ' offered a 1973 production of Aym√©'s play "" Other People's Heads "" . It's a good choice for the television format , as the characters are kept on a single set by one character who holds them prisoner in a room . Several other plays - - notably ' The Petrified Forest ' - - have also used the hostage situation as a successful conceit for a one-room drama . Fr√©d√©ric Maillard is a procurer : the French court system's equivalent of an assistant district attorney . Maillard is an extremely respectable man , so of course he has a few guilty secrets . Maillard has an attractive wife , Juliette , but he also has a mistress : none other than Roberte Bertolier , whose husband is Maillard's fellow procurer . Tonight , the Maillards and the Bertoliers are celebrating Fr√©d√©ric's greatest triumph . He has just convicted a man for murder . What makes this conviction so noteworthy is the fact that there was absolutely no evidence against the defendant , a man named Valorin . . . yet Fr√©d√©ric convinced a jury to convict Valorin purely by means of his own eloquence . Valorin has received the death sentence . The victory party is so jubilant that none of the celebrants is particularly disturbed when news arrives that Valorin has escaped . Guess who's coming to dinner . Valorin arrives chez Maillard , and proceeds to hold everyone prisoner . Now , they will listen to him . . . or else . SPOILERS COMING . Aym√©'s script skilfully combines drama , suspense and comedy , as the dishonesties of Maillard and the others are exposed . Valorin insists that he is innocent of the murder , and now he reveals an alibi which he was prevented from offering at his trial . On the night of the crime , Valorin was miles away . . . having sex with Roberte Bertolier ! There are several good performances here - - especially that of Georges Aminel as the desperate fugitive - - and the entire play is well-paced and expertly directed . I'll rate this .


Text2: The very first stop-action animation . I viewed a print of this short film in the archives of the British Film Institute . ' Matches : An Appeal ' is the earliest known example of stop-animation , or indeed any form of movie animation . It is therefore of vital historic importance despite its crudity . The very brief film shows a stick-figure made of matchsticks , who climbs a stepladder to swab a paintbrush against a wall . In a technique that probably looked extremely unconvincing even to contemporary audiences , words form on the wall , presumably painted by the match-man . The message reads : ' For one guinea Messrs Bryant & May will forward a case containing sufficient to supply a box of matches to each man in a battalion with the name of the sender inside ' . As the film is dated 1899 ( when matches were still comparatively expensive items ) , presumably the battalions are British troops serving in the Boer War . However , I spoke with a curator at BFI who absolutely asserts that this film was made in the early 20th century and accordingly refers to the Great War . As I viewed an acetate dupe print rather than the original footage , I shan't offer any opinion as to this film's provenance . By modern standards , this film is almost laughably crude . But its historical significance is undeniable . I'll rate this very short film .

Text2: Duke played like a piccolo . A common thread running through Cecil B . DeMille films is the leading lady having two men getting their hormones in an uproar over the leading lady . You've got Joel McCrea and Robert Preston rivals for Barbara Stanwyck in Union Pacific , Gary Cooper and Preston Foster over Madeline Carroll in Northwest Mounted Police , Charlton Heston and Cornel Wilde flipping for Betty Hutton in The Greatest Show On Earth , etc . But DeMille never did this theme better than in Reap The Wild Wind . Without Paulette Goddard coquetting both John Wayne and Ray Milland , you wouldn't have a plot for this film . Additionally John Wayne for what maybe the only time in his film career plays a knave . After appearing to lose Paulette Goddard to Milland , Wayne goes over to Raymond Massey and Massey plays him like a piccolo and wins him over to his nefarious schemes . Massey gives the best performance in the movie . There is a long trial sequence and Massey being an extremely shrewd lawyer almost turns the whole trial around and has court convinced that it's Ray Milland behind all the pirate wrecks in the Florida Keys . This after playing John Wayne for a fool . Massey is done in of course , but by something he really couldn't take into account . The action takes place in the Florida Keys where Paulette Goddard owns a salvage company . Yet she lives in grand plantation style that would put Tara to shame . Now Florida was a Confederate state , but the only part of Florida that had the plantation culture was the panhandle . You didn't have Tara style mansions in the Keys . But because the movie is set in the South you also have some really bad black stereotypes . DeMille was hardly the only director to use them though . But one incredible error slips through . One of the characters during the trial was a black actor named Oscar Polk who plays Saltmeat who is a crew member of John Wayne's ship and gives a key piece of testimony that ultimately proves to be Raymond Massey's downfall . Saltmeat is identified as a Barbadoes free Negro in the film . But Saltmeat doesn't talk like Harry Belafonte . He sounds like any ordinary black actor who would be playing a field hand on the old plantation . I can't believe DeMille didn't realize this error . But I guess it was easier to bow to the racial stereotypes than show a black character realistically in context . The movie made a lot of money in 1942 . It was filmed in great technicolor and it did win an Oscar for Special Effects because of the climatic fight with a giant squid that Milland and Wayne engage in . The effects look cheesy now , but back in 1942 they were something else . I think a lot of black people would be terribly offended if they watched this dated epic .

422,"Text1: A descent into total madness ( Thre are Spoilers ) A movie that's incomprehensible no matter how you try to describe or explain it . "" The Shout "" is a film with an irrational story about a lunatic spinning a tale about his experiences from the wild Australian outback to a sleepy little town on the coast of England as he's being examined by a doctor at the mental institution that he's been incarcerated in . This happens during a game of cricket on the hospital grounds between the staff and inmates . Charles Crossley , Alan Bates , is telling his doctor Robert Graves , Tim Curry , how he developed strange and mystic powers while he was living with the aborigines for 18 years in the wild reaches of the Australian desert and perfected among other things the "" Terror Shout "" that can kill in an instant anyone who's near enough to hear it . Imposing himself on a naive and unsuspecting couple Anthony , John Hurt , and Rachel , Susannah York , Fielding when returning to England Crossley became the guest that just doesn't want to leave . Using what he learned from the aborigines Crossley steals one of Rachel's shoes and casts a spell on it where she becomes madly in love with him giving into his every whim and command . Even sitting at the foot of the kitchen table , like the family dog , and eating scraps that Crossley throws at her as her astounded husband Anthony watches . Crossley talking about the human soul and how it can be hidden in a tree or stone or anywhere else besides the human body and about his power to be able to affect the dreaded "" Terror Shout "" . Crossley then takes Anthony out into the sheep meadow , where there's no one around , and demonstrates the "" Terror Shout "" by telling Anthony to stuff his ears with whatever is available to him and then let's it roar . Anthony gets his brains scrambled and almost all the sheep that were in the meadow were killed by Crossleys animal-like howl . Anthony later finding the stone where Crossley's soul resides in and then breaking it that in affect breaks the hold that Crossley had on him and his wife and lands Crossley into the asylum that he is in now . Reliving his story in what looks like a hot dog or refreshment stand on the institutions park grounds it suddenly begins to rain very heavily . As the cricket game is called off some of the staff an inmates start to push the stand where Crossley and Dr . Graves are in away from the downpour . With his talk being suddenly interrupted by all this Crossley becomes very violent and agitated and starts to scream out hysterically . It's then Where Dr . Graves tells him to shout , maybe believing that it would settle him down . That turned out to be a bad mistake on the part of Dr . Graves where Crossley gives out a tremendous and ear-splitting "" Terror Shout "" where the stand that he and Dr . Graves are in seems to be hit by a sudden bolt of lighting with both Crossley and Dr . Graves as well as a number of staff and inmates of the institution ending up dead . The more that I watch this movie the more I get confused , just what were the writer and director trying to tell the audience ? Or was the film supposed to be a lesson of how a man can become so immersed in his detachment from reality that in the end he descends in to total madness .


Text2: A Nutshell Review : The Ex If I were to look at it , I would say The Ex aka Fast Track forms a loose trilogy of sorts with regards to growing up , and somewhat like a natural progression in the different stages of life that Zach Braff's characters form when stringed together . With Garden State , it's in the 20s where you're having a feel for the ground , exploring your options and not knowing exactly what life will dish out to you . With One Last Kiss , so you think that you're dead sure about your other half , you're getting married and vowing to spend the rest of your lives together , and suddenly an ingenue comes along , and cast doubts about that . Plenty of what-will-you-do moments , with outcome that are different depending on your values , but totally possible , and brought out earnestly through Braff's performance as the everyday man . In The Ex , Zach Braff plays the blue collar salaryman whose hotshot lawyer wife had just given birth and as agreed , she'll be a stay home mum . But he just got fired from his job , thus sending their agreement into red alert zone . Taking up his father in law's offer , he uproots himself , wife and baby and starts work in a new age advertising company , only to meet up with his wife's ex . You'd come to expect the usual jokes about not fitting into a totally different corporate culture with its own idiosyncrasies , conflict with the parents , and the constant threat posed by the wife's ex Chip Sanders played by Jason Bateman , which I bet almost every male would want to kill given his attitude and back stabbing nature . It's classic office politics at work as we root for the survival of Zach's Tom Reilly , though at times you'd expect him to have a little more backbone , and a little bit of smarts to survive the jungle out there . If that sounds a little like Meet The Parents , it does . And it also is styled after Just Friends in the rivalry department , where two guys do battle over a girl , only that this time , it's the third party up against a married couple . Though I'd say it again , nothing beats riling you up when you see how the bastard at work gets away with almost everything , and get incensed with his obvious intentions to bang his ex , i . e . the wife . The flow of the movie did seem a little broken at times , which I suspect that there were a lot more filmed than was put on screen , perhaps saving them for the DVD release . The ideas injected into the movie were numerous , but that made for the narrative feeling a little scattered . For instance , Amanda Peet as the wife Sofia Kowalski didn't really have much to do except nurse the baby , and be in some of the most trying comedic scenes such as the ones involving yoga . Fans of Braff will not want to miss yet another familiar performance , and remember to stay tune during the credits for a coda , as well as various bloopers , some of which are genuinely funnier than the bits that made it to the movie .

423,"Text1: The biggest reason to see this Laurel and Hardy film is to see a very young Jean Harlow For years there has been a half-truth among Hollywood lore that Howard Hughes "" discovered "" Jean Harlow when he cast her to star in HELL'S ANGELS . While this may have been her first big role , she'd already appeared in quite a few shorts for the Hal Roach Studios . This film , in fact , was the second Laurel and Hardy film in which she appeared ( the other being LIBERTY ) . While her role is not huge , it's very clear that this is Jean - - though her 1930s trademark looks are not present in DOUBLE WHOOPEE . Aside from Jean , it's pretty much an average to below average Laurel and Hardy film . I think most of this is because while funny , the chemistry isn't quite right here , though it's hard to exactly put my finger on it . It just didn't seem quite like a Laurel and Hardy film - - and by 1929 the style and format of their shorts was pretty much established . The boys play employees that are sent by an agency to work at a nice New York hotel . At the same time , a rich European prince arrives and the folks at the hotel mistake Stan and Ollie for the prince and his Prime Minister . After finally discovering the mistake , they put the boys to work . There are two main "" big gags "" in this film . The first involves a contrived bit involving an incredibly unsafe elevator . Through no fault of Stan and Ollie , the Prince keeps falling down the elevator shaft . This bit was a bit over-used and also had me wondering if they really made elevators like this . If so , then I am surprised that most Americans weren't killed ! The second is a series of bit like you'd see in other Laurel and Hardy films such as TIT FOR TAT and TWO TARS . A small argument escalates and Ollie and a tough guy ( Charles Hall - - in a very typical role for him ) start destroying each other's clothes - - and Stan joining in for good measure . This bit is reprised later inside the hotel with the other hotel employees and soon everyone is fighting and destroying each other's outfits . Both gags are reasonably funny to watch but also seem amazingly contrived if not impossible - - making the humor just a bit forced . Still , it's not a bad film at all , though one that is best remembered for a small part played by a young and relatively inexperienced Jean Harlow .


Text2: A case of high expectations that just didn't pan out , . . . Given that Sergio Leone was partially responsible for this film ( though he did not direct it , I found out later ) , I grabbed the tape and was excited . After all , his Westerns from the 60s were among the best of the genre ever made . However , despite this past track record , this film was a major disappointment to me because it seems the writers tried to combine many of the typical Leone elements with a comedy ! ! ? ? Huh ? ! I do NOT watch a "" Spaghetti Western "" for its comedy ( though there may be a few funny moments , they are not meant as comedy ) . And , to let the audience know it's all supposed to be funny , Ennio Merricone's score ( usually the highlight of any Western ) sounds like it belongs to a 1960s or 70s Disney movie much of the time ! Now , if I had no idea who Leone was and if I had never even seen an Italian Western , I still think I would not have particularly liked this movie all that much . That's because the two central characters are just so different - - Fonda as the cold gunfighter and Hill as a crazy , lovable jerk that could probably out-shoot anyone . The movie should have focused on one of these interesting men period . Then , the movie would have done more to energize this dying genre .

425,"Text1: The One With the Two Cigarettes Lit by the Man at the Same Time This may be the best soap opera love film from Hollywood in it's golden age - it certainly is among them , and it certainly is Bette Davis ' best soap opera role : Charlotte Vale . From neurotic , overweight recluse to sophisticated traveler , to surrogate mother of the daughter of the man she loves but can't have . It is 1942 , and divorce is still a sticky matter . Davis always denied that , eventually , her character and Jerry Durrance ( Paul Henried ) would have married ( presumably when his daughter Tina would grow up ) . She insisted that she and Dr . Jacquith ( Claude Rains ) would have married . If so it would probably been a friendly marriage - not a sexually based one . I suppose her guess was based on her involvement with Jacquith's country rest home ( they are planning a whole new wing she's financing at the end of the film ) . Certainly she is getting involved , and Jacquith does look at her in a slightly different way just before the end of the film . But Jacquith has never even shown anything but a doctor's interest in Charlotte in the film - it has blossomed into a friendship though . The film has many lovely moments in it - some quite funny actually . The car wreck in Brazil with Giuseppi , the taxi driver who barely speaks English ( "" Banana trees "" is one of his phrases ) is amusing . Even the autocratic Mrs . Vale ( Dame Gladys Cooper ) makes some cracks that are funny ( her comparison of people to flowers for example ) . Cooper's autocratic old line female Brahman is a wonderful acting job , nearly stealing the movie from Davis and Rains at times . It earned her an Oscar nomination . And Bonita Granville certainly does a nice job as Charlotte's niece , who likes to tease her ( apparently a family habit ) , but eventually realizes that Charlotte is as normal as she is . Any film with a title based on a Walt Whitman quote must be good . If you have never seen this one , see it soon .


Text2: An adult film with comic edges This movie is going to enter the area of Hollywood Legend because of the background circumstances that mirror it's theme . I am referring to how Jennifer Aniston's marriage to Brad Pitt collapsed ( apparently ) after the latter made the film MR . AND MRS . SMITH with Angelina Jolie , and Pitt and Jolie's subsequent romance blossomed into a marriage with children both conceived and adopted by the parents . Ms Aniston subsequently made this film with Vince Vaughan , with whom she too would have a relationship ( that now seems to be over ) . Since this film is about how relationships between couples fail through non-chemistry or miscalculation or misunderstanding , the film seems to mirror the Aniston - Pitt - Jolie triangle . Oddly enough , that is the one element of such dissolutions that does not appear in this film . Although all sorts of escalating confrontations occur ( including a couple of dates Aniston goes on ) there was no real triangle for either of the two principles . THE BREAK-UP begins with Vaughan at a baseball game with his closest friend ( Jon Favrreau - a man who if there is any possibility that a person is doing something for a good reason or a hurtful reason , will always figure out it is for the hurtful reason ) . He sees Aniston at the game , and is really struck by her - in fact he gives her one of six hot-dogs he buys so that he can talk to her . Eventually he coaxes her into going out with him for a drink . Soon a series of still photos show how they seem to be on the right wavelength for being married eventually . But it's all surface unity . While Aniston is into some sports ( baseball and bowling ) she is also rather artistic . Her family happens to be from academia , and she works in an art gallery . Her favorite sibling ( her brother ) is a member of an all male chorus of harmonizers . It turns out that Vaughan does not think well of her family ( which he probably thinks looks down on him ) . In particular he considers Aniston's brother ( John Michael Higgins ) a closet gay man - something Aniston keeps denying . Vaughan and his two brothers run a tourist bus company , and are planning expansion for a tourist boat , and hopefully a helicopter as well . Vaughan is the guide , and is usually exhausted when he gets home - too exhausted to follow simple requests , like the purchase of a specific number of lemons for a dinner party . The dinner party is the point where the schism between Aniston and Vaughan begins to widen . Aniston feels Vaughan lacks any true feeling for her efforts - he rarely volunteers to assist her . Vaughan feels that Aniston does not appreciate his hard working schedule ( although he keeps ignoring her hard work at the art gallery owned by Judy Davis ) . So we watch as Aniston refuses to have anything to do with Vaughan ( hoping , in his loneliness he will return with contrition ) , and Vaughan escalates to undoing various things about the apartment that Aniston was opposed to ( watch the business about the pool table ) , and then the division of the apartment into his and her sections , and a no-man's land for helpless guests . Soon it also involves their friends on the bowling team and on game night . . . well you can see the threads of the relationship just split apart like a fat man putting on an old army uniform . It is actually a sad story of two people , who for all their anger do still care for each other , but who through mistiming and intentional explosions of anger wreck the possible reunification of their lives together . Yet , at the end they are both aware of what their stupidity has caused - so that there is no hard feelings at the conclusion . It was a pretty good look at people fumbling at a lasting relationship , but growing up in the end . If the Aniston - Pitt - Jolie business helped to create this project , something worthwhile came out of that love triangle .

426,"Text1: Words Can't Do Justice It seems almost pointless for me to add any comments here , since everyone else who's posted has done such a great job of summarizing this film's merits , but I can't resist . How do you rate a movie like this ? On the one hand , it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen : completely lacking in coherence , shameful acting , writing so bad it seems to be making fun of itself . In fact , I'm still not convinced this movie isn't supposed to be a parody of Christina Crawford's book rather than a serious attempt to adapt it to the screen . On the other hand , it's such a rip-roarin ' good time of a show that I'm tempted to give it 10 stars on the strength of its sheer entertainment value alone . Faye Dunaway gives the most jaw-droppingly mesmerizing freak out ever captured on screen , whose bizarreness cannot even be topped by Halle Berry's Oscar acceptance speech . Dunaway must have realized early on that she was a rat in a sinking ship , but instead of deserting , she decides instead to devour the crew . I don't know if her performance comes anywhere close to capturing the real Joan Crawford , but if Crawford was even a tenth of a percent as loony as Dunaway portrays her here , I would have been high-tailing it to Canada if I were either of her children . The fabulous lines , many of which are quoted on this site , can't really be done justice when removed from the context in which they appear , and you really have to see the faces of the actors as they're delivering them to get the full effect . The wire hanger scene is of course a classic , but it's really the floor scrubbing scene immediately following , with Dunaway in kabuki makeup squatting on the floor like a Sumo wrestler , that remains more memorable . Watching Joanie jog is a sight to behold , especially when she starts talking to herself and scrunching her face up as if she's imitating Alvin or one of his chipmunks . There's the "" I can handle the socks "" moment , one of the most seductive moments ( hee , hee ) in film history , and of course the coup de grace comes when Joanie tackles Christina across the coffee table and begins banging her head into the floor like she's in a women's prison movie . The editing in this film is atrocious . There's no sense of time ; events follow each other in a loosely chronological fashion , but they don't make dramatic or narrative sense . Frank Perry , the director , must have been dozing off through much of this production ; either that or his film crew carried out a mutiny , tied him up , threw him in a shed , and went ahead without him . But it seems churlish to criticize a film like this for its poor film making . It's like kicking a dead horse . All I can say is , if you watch this movie with the right people in the right frame of mind ( i . e . with alcohol ) , you will be howling . I watched this with a group in college , and we had to periodically pause the movie in order to allow everyone to recover before continuing . Thank you , Ms . Dunaway , for giving us "" Mommie Dearest . "" The world will never be able to repay you for your kindness . or ( depending on your perspective and level of sobriety )


Text2: Playing With Fire In Greek legend Prometheus stole fire from the Gods and laid it on Man . For this he was chained to a rock and each evening an eagle would peck out his liver . It may help to know that before watching this film . On the other hand . . . Clearly there's a metaphor in there somewhere and Marcel L'Herbier - who made the wonderful La Nuit Fantastique some twenty years later - has pounced on it and tells a tale of a financier who ' borrows ' rather than perhaps ' steals ' money from the Bourse and lays it on his clients . Naturally it all ends in tears because financiers nearly always have personal secretaries who are only human and often have a little larceny going for them in spots and if there's woman in the frame one shudders to think of what might happen . For 1921 this is a fine effort and worth catching up with .

So why am I not going to trash this little movie ? It's simple , I really like this film for those very reasons . It is everything low-budget horror movie should be , yet still manages to tell its story and generate a considerable amount of unease and dread . A cruise ship is destroyed by another ship ( the Death Ship ) , killing most of the crew . The few survivors of the crash , who include the captain ( George Kennedy from "" Creepshow 2 "" or "" Just Before Dawn "" ) , a family of four and some others , decide that it would be a good idea to board the same ship that crashed their cruise ship . The death ship then starts killing its new victims . Despite so many bad comments "" Death Ship "" is still watchable . It has some really creepy scenes and memorable moments . Yes , the film doesn't make very much sense , but that's not what director Alvin Rakoff intended . Instead he puts together nightmarish sequences surrounded by an eerie sounds .

Text2: Noises Within , Noises Without There are a few flaws in this otherwise successful film that is in fact as frightening as the trailer makes it out to be . Not being one for the constant barrage of thriller films ( the ' Saw ' Series , the endless vampire variations , ' I know what you did . . . ' , etc ) this viewer hesitantly watched what could have been yet another exercise in blood and gore . But surprise ! The story ( based on a true incident in 2005 as outlined by an off camera narrator discussing the number of violent deaths in America each year before the film opens ) is tight , credible , and deals more with the emotion of terror of the unknown than images of gore . Kudos to writer / director Bryan Bertino for finding the core of the macabre . And it is true ! James Hoyt ( Scott Speedman ) is driving his girlfriend Kristen MacKay ( Liv Tyler ) to the isolated summer home in the woods that James and his best friend Mike ( Glenn Howerton ) had earlier decorated with rose petals , candles and champagne in preparation for what was supposed to be a celebration of a marriage proposal . Sadness prevails in the car as Kristen has turned James ' proposal down . They quietly enter the decorated house , and almost immediately begin to hear sounds outside and a door knock by a young girl apparently looking for a person not living in this house . Kristen asks James to go out and get her cigarettes and the creepy action begins . Three strangers each in masks terrify Kristen with noises , secretly entering the house , and creating a tense atmosphere until James returns . At this point the story becomes an almost unbearable sequence of events : it is clear the strangers are out to murder James and Kristen . Bound and beaten by the three strangers Kristen asks ' Why us ? Why do you want to kill us ? ' and the simple answer from of the strangers is ' Because you're home ' . The ending of the film could have been better handled by someone telling us the results of the night - the follow up to this true story . But instead Bertino elects to keep the level of terror high . Peter Sova ( cinematographer ) finds the right amount of shadow and dark to keep us guessing and the musical score by tomandandy is pitch perfect . This is a fine little film , but be prepared to jump in a few spots . . . and keep the lights on ! Grady Harp

I'm not sure why it bothers me so much in this movie when I can let it go in movies with similar racial incidents like any of the Tarzan movies , but it really bothered me here . The characters ( an by this I mean the white characters ) attitudes toward the shooting of an innocent native is so nonchalant . It's no big deal to any of them . You kill a human being and then have the nerve to feel you're being wronged by the other members of his tribe because they want and expect retribution ? it's something my 21st Century sensibilities cannot comprehend . And it's not just the "" bad "" guy . The "" good "" characters have the same "" no big deal "" attitude . I honestly think it bothered me so much in Jungle Goddess because the movie is so bad there's nothing to take the edge of these scenes . The racial attitudes of the 1940s were given the opportunity to stand front and center and show just how repulsive they really were . Okay , off the soapbox for a bit . As I say , Jungle Goddess is Dull with a capital "" D "" . None of the three main actors ( George Reeves , Wanda McKay , and Ralph Byrd ) seems capable of displaying any of the realistic emotions you might expect from someone lost in the jungle . In fact , McKay plays it much like a little girl going to a tea party . It's completely unbelievable . Speaking of unbelievable , the sets are some of the worst I've seen . You can find more realistic looking plastic plants at the local Wal Mart . And the stock footage scenes of animals don't help at all . It's all too obvious that the characters are no where near the animals . Add it up ? cheap sets , dull script , and uninspired acting make for one very bad movie .

429,"Text1: "" Does it surprise you to find people who aren't like you ? "" Here's a solid little Randolph Scott number with a fine supporting cast taking place only a few weeks after the Civil War has ended . That's unknown to Major Matt Stewart ( Scott ) , and his band of Rebels at the time they hijack a quarter million dollar gold shipment from a band of Union soldiers . Attempting to outrun the authorities that are soon to follow , they find themselves holed up at a way station with two stagecoach travelers who were on board when the Rebs sought cover for their getaway . Lee Marvin gets a fair amount of screen time as the Major's trigger happy , hot headed second , and the story offers a number of scenes where the two collide verbally and physically . It was somewhat of a breakout role for Marvin , who prior had mainly uncredited film parts and a few TV series appearances . The expected final confrontation between the pair however is interrupted by the young soldier Jamie ( Claude Jarman Jr . ) watching his commanding officer's back . It was somewhat of a twist to the story for this viewer , as all the while , the film kept making it a point that the young man had never killed anyone before , not even during the war . It brought full circle to a remark the Major made to him early in their story that before they got back home , Jamie would have to find a way to become a man . I guess I'm not used to seeing someone like Donna Reed in a Western , so her appearance took some getting used to . I can't say I was fully convinced with her character falling in love with the Major , considering the circumstances of their involvement with the Rebels , and even more so , the palpable difference in their ages . It didn't hurt that her traveling companion and self professed fianc√©e ( Richard Denning ) was such a lout , thereby setting up the comparison between himself and Scott's character . The near finale with the Major against the leader of the outlaw posse ( Ray Teal ) was somewhat original in it's execution and outcome . Oddly staged , it was surprisingly believable that the villain could be hauled away , stuck in his horse's stirrup . Thinking about it , I wondered how far the horse might have run and what the fate of Teal's character Quincey might have been . Would he have been dragged to death , fallen loose , or left to some other fate ? Curious to ponder if nothing else . Ultimately , the Major vindicates himself in his sweetheart's eyes when he and his partner Jamie drop their saddlebags of gold bars . You kind of wondered what would happen with all that gold , and in some measure , I still do . Left with the station agent and his daughter in law , there wasn't much in the neighborhood they could do with it all .


Text2: A Bit Better Than A Mere Curiosity I saw this film once on the American Movie Classics Channel ( about 1999 ) . Laurel & Hardy gained an international audience in the silent film period , mostly due to the physical nature of their comedy , but also because it being silent the dialog could be covered from one non-English speaking country to another with dialog cards that were in the language of that country . Along came the coming of sound and they faced the loss of most of their audience ( the idea of dubbing had not taken root yet ) . So Hal Roach and the boys constructed a number of films in the period from 1930 to 1931 that were in German , Spanish , and French . Not all of these films have survived - one in particular is sorely missed : the French version of PARDON US , in which the villain played by Walter Long is played by an up-and-coming performer named Boris Karloff . It was Karloff's only appearance with Stan and Ollie , and only a single still photo ( of him threatening them in the prison yard ) still exists . POLITIQUERIAS was the Spanish version of the short CHICKENS COME HOME , wherein Ollie is a successful businessman who is the reform candidate for Mayor . A shoe-in , he is unsettled by the discovery that a former girlfriend is threatening to reveal their relationship unless he pays her up . But she is trying to force him to see her that very night , when he is entertaining the reform leadership at his home . So he sends Stan to occupy her until he can visit himself . Naturally , Stan will screw up and she will show up at the Hardy mansion . The English version , that most fans are aware of , is about twenty five minutes long . But the Spanish version was quite a bit longer - almost a mini-feature film . In the English version Hardy's dinner party is taken for granted - he is the host who is trying to keep a good face before his biggest supporters , and in the face of increasing heat from his suspicious wife . On top of that his butler , Jimmy Finlayson , is blackmailing him continuously ( William Everson pointed out , in THE COMPLETE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY that while Finlayson is usually the social superior of the boys in their films , here , although he is a servant , he still getting the better of Ollie ) . Also , there are some cuts to Stanley's failure to control the other woman ( Mae Busch , of course ) , and how a friend of Mrs . Hardy ( a dried up old prude ) follows Stan and acts as a vindictive bolt of lightning on the boys . In this Spanish version Hardy's party takes center stage , with his hired entertainment acts being filler between the story line sequences . In particular there is the scenes with Hadji-Ali , the great regurgitator of the music halls and vaudeville houses of Europe and America . Oddly enough , a few years ago , in a special documentary about magicians and the like , the footage of Hadji-Ali from POLITIQUERIAS was used to demonstrate his remarkable act . He also teaches Jimmy Finlayson a lesson , when he uses him as an assistant in his act , and Jimmy gets soaked as a result . That the sound of that Scottish voice and that Georgian voice are now struggling with phonetically written Spanish is not a negative . Both do well enough , and it does not harm an English speaking audience , who would recall the English version . The film remains funny for the boys work and Finlayson , and one gets a rare opportunity to see a one time headliner who astounded audiences with his curious magic act .

Text2: Better than Titanic ! What's up with all these high schools in the movies having these insane senior trips ? The kids in Final Destination flew to Europe , and these kids go on a freaking cruise ? I went to Magic Mountain for my senior trip ! Oh , well , I guess the payback is that in the movies they all get killed . Magic Mountain sounds a lot better in that sense . By this point in the lengthy Friday the 13th saga , it's clear that even the writers of these movies ( generally the last people to catch on when they come up with idiotic ideas ) have noticed that a lot of teenagers going up to Camp Crystal Lake to be rebellious and get slashed all up is getting a little bit old , so in this installment they decided it would be a good idea to have the movie take place on a whole ship full of high school students . Moving someone like Jason Voorhees from his home on Camp Crystal Lake to an unfamiliar setting is actually a really good idea for generating more interest in the series , because although it's a given in a series like this , I think audiences always like to see familiar characters come back from other stories . So while you already know Jason is going to be in the movie because it's a Friday the 13th , you at least see him in an unfamiliar atmosphere , which removes a lot of the automatic cynicism that is now being generated toward the teenagers who are still stupid enough to go out to the lake . Now we see Jason killing all kinds of kids unsuspectingly on their school trip and then more people on the streets of New York . Amazing the things we find entertaining these days , isn't it ? There are a lot of fairly innovative deaths aboard the ship in the first half of the film , such as a guy relaxing in the sauna getting one of the hot rocks shoved through his stomach , a guy getting impaled on the communication antenna on the boat , and throat slit by a machete , an amazingly botched scene . You would think that since it was so obvious the knife didn't even touch that poor guy , they would at least not have done it in such a close-up . Ironically enough , the part that I was anticipating to be the most interesting was the least creatively done . After realizing what is going on on the boat ( meaning , after just about all of them had been killed ) , the surviving students on board get the life raft and escape , rowing out into the dark ocean in hopes of hitting land . Eventually , they see the New York City skyline and jump for joy . I was anticipating a creative and fun romp through the streets of New York , maybe with Jason confused at his surroundings and therefore going even more nuts , which would create havoc among the population . I mean , LOOK at the guy . He spent the time between the last movie and this one rotting on the bottom of the lake , and he certainly looks like it through this entire movie . Unfortunately , the filmmakers not only revealed the modesty of their budget through the lack of anything really interesting happening , they also displayed a massive lack of understanding of the geography of the city of New York . I've never even been there myself , but it seems like pretty much basic logic that they would not design the city so that the dirtiest slums had the finest waterfront property . Meaning , I doubt you could row up to New York from the ocean , right alongside the Statue of Liberty , and climb up onto land , finding yourself surrounded by endless alleyways full of things like gun-toting rapists and standing barrels of toxic waste . New York is a big city , and all cities throughout the world pretty much have to have things like this somewhere , but generally not right on the water and right next to major monuments . I happen to know , for example , that if you go to San Francisco , you won't find the crime-ridden slums right under the Golden Gate Bridge , and I doubt that you would find open barrels of toxic waste ANYWHERE . But anyway , they certainly find some room for effective comic relief ( although notably less than other films in the series ) , my favorite example of which is the scene where","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: I've never thought much of Robert Goulet , but he's good as David March I Deal in Danger is not really a movie , but a couple episodes of a television show called "" Blue Light "" that were edited together . The show told the story of an Allied secret agent named David March who has defected to the German side . March has , for the most part , been accepted by the Nazi high command . In reality , March is a double agent still working with the Allies in their fight against Hitler and Nazi Germany . Because of its multi-episode television origin , I Deal in Danger features two distinct plot lines . The first , and probably my favorite , finds a skeptical SS officer ( Werner Peters ) looking to test March's loyalty to the Third Reich . Another British agent who wants to switch sides and work for Germany gives the SS officer his opportunity . What the SS officer doesn't know is that the Englishman is also a double agent . The second plot thread sees March get reassigned to a secret underground German weapons facility . March must convenience a female scientist to help him destroy the facility . Overall , I quite enjoyed I Deal in Danger . The film is well paced ( any boring bits from the television show were most likely edited out ) and reasonably entertaining throughout . There are a few surprises along the way such as the scientist who helps March being allowed to die in the explosion . It's not your standard happy ending . I've never thought much of Robert Goulet , but off the top of my head , this is probably one of the better things I've ever seen him in . Goulet is just rugged and cool enough to pull it off . And I really appreciate the fact that Goulet was allowed to play March completely straight without a hint of irony or comedy . The supporting cast is surprisingly strong with actors like Peters providing Goulet with an excellent nemesis . My biggest compliant is that Goulet's character is allowed to be something of a superman . There's one instance in the movie where March single handedly breaks into a Nazi prison to free a scientist . He seems to know exactly where the scientist is being held , he knows exactly where the guards are , and he knows exactly where to place his explosives . Such a mission would have been impossible . Finally , although there was obviously a decent budget involved , I Deal in Danger never overcomes its television roots . I'm not sure I know how to put this , but I Deal in Danger has a look and feel to it that just screams 60s American television . Until I watched I Deal in Danger , I had never even heard of "" Blue Light "" . It's not that odd considering I was only three years-old when it aired and there were only 17 episodes . Now , however , I would love to see someone bring the show to DVD . I know I'd buy it .

For example as soon as the company credits read Nu Image I knew instinctively I'd seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn't remember where . Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was . Maybe I'm psychic ? ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . I don't know about you but I'm geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it's spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . Anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . Oh did I mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? Yeah he's a serious badass mofo . In fact he's so bad ( And I don't mean the acting - I'll get to that in a moment ) that he's impossible to take seriously and this is before he's executed only to return as Elton John , Elvis , a French chef etc . I wonder if Keith David got paid for this ? because he looks lke he's having so much fun on screen that's the only reason he's playing the role . What a pity this reviewer didn't have any fun whatsoever watching JUDGE AND JURY . Hey maybe the producers could send me Keith's fee ? Gawd only knows I deserve it . I disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn't guessed and my main beef isn't with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . If like me you've had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you'll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but JUDGE AND JURY will have you believe that if you're thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you'll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs .

Text2: An absolutely hilarious short from beginning to end , with a funny premise This is one of my favorite Bugs Bunny shorts , which deftly illustrates one of Chuck Jones's rules for his Bugs cartoons , which was that Bugs should never go after anyone for no good reason-he has to be the aggrieved party first in some way and merely evening the score with a bad guy . Because I want to discuss some of the details , this is a spoiler warning : The short opens with Bugs on his way to meet his cousin Herman when he runs into a boulder-sized gold nugget . After whooping it up about his good fortune ( "" I'm rich beyond the means of avarice ! "" ) , Bugs suddenly turns paranoid and protective , none of which escapes the notice of Nasty Canasta , who opens up a "" bank "" where Bugs foolishly deposits his gold . Thinking better of it , he goes back to get his gold , only to have Canasta literally close the bank facade on and around him , trapping him inside . Placing a boulder on the cube encasing the rabbit , Canasta rides off with Bugs's gold , leaving only Bugs's eyes visible and we hear him say , "" You realize that this will not go unchallenged ! "" and we know that Canasta is in deep trouble . Some six months later , as Canasta is marking a deck of cards in preparation of the opening of his saloon and casino , who should come in but our hero , suited up as a hayseed with his hair full of hay ? If you said Bugs , you win a carrot ! He asks if he can use Canasta's "" Telio-phone "" , pointing at a slot machine . Canasta chuckles and says "" Sure ! "" , at which point Bugs hits the jackpot and a huge pile of coins pours out . Canasta urges him to stick around and play some games . We all know who's going to win-Bugs is the hero here , after all-the fun is in watching just how Bugs makes Canasta the patsy , when Canasta thinks he's got a live sucker ripe for the fleecing . They play "" marbles , Frisco style "" , with Bugs winning a penny bet on 23 , being told that here , the customer always wins , Bugs placing a huge stack on 23 again and Canasta not only nailing a block of wood in place over 23 ( so no one else-in an empty casino-can bet on 23 ) , but using a rigged wheel , only to have the ball go into 23 because of Canasta's actions . They then play poker , with a few cute puns and Canasta says , "" I got a full house-what you got ? "" , to which Bugs says , "" Does that beat two pair ? I have a pair of red ones ( aces ) and a pair of black ones ( also aces ) and Canasta is visibly stunned at losing . As Bugs is getting ready to leave , Canasta pulls out a revolver , Bugs then spins the cylinder and hits another jackpot . After a predictable ( but still funny ) final visual gag , Bugs leaves with a final funny line , which I won't spoil here . This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 and is well worth having . Highly recommended .

434,"Text1: In loving memory of Gillo Pontecorvo , who died last week Pontecorvo's followup to The Battle of Algiers , and probably his second most famous film . That's probably mostly because of the film's star , Marlon Brando , but the movie itself is quite good . It's a little slow , sometimes a little difficult to follow , and it hits us with no less than three third act speeches ( a speech a character makes near the end of the picture which more or less explains the film's themes , just in case you missed it ) . At it's best , though , Burn ! is a powerful treatise on the pains caused by colonialism . The story centers on a British man , Brando , who goes to the Portuguese-run island of Queimada in order to provoke a slave rebellion . He preaches freedom to the slaves , but his real aim is to get control over the island's sugar . A decade or so after the original rebellion , the natives aren't co-operating with the British anymore , and Brando returns to overthrow their leader ( Evaristo M√°rquez ) , whose career he fostered . Brando is , as expected , excellent . I wouldn't rank this among his very best performances ( the inevitable Italian dubbing always makes all performances a tad awkward ) , but it's definitely second tier Brando . This might be the most despicable character he ever got to play . I also liked M√°rquez , who often gets criticized for giving a wooden performance . The cinematography is beautiful , and Ennio Morricone provides an amazing score ( I love the song that plays after the revolution ) . Gillo Pontecorvo's direction is very good . In fact , I think I slightly prefer this to his acknowledged ( in my opinion , overrated ) masterpiece , The Battle of Algiers .

With the untimely passing of George Carlin - now among a number of others , Jim Henson , Belushi , Andy Kaufman , Gilda Radner , Billy Preston , who have died - Lorne Michaels made the wise choice to replay the first episode in its unedited glory . It's not a perfect program by any stretch , but its messiness is half the fun . One might like one skit over the other , or prefer one musical guest to the other ( frankly , I prefer the funky beats of Preston over the melancholy Janis Ian tunes ) , or wonder what is up with these strange looking Muppets from Henson , or how outrageous Albert Brooks could get for better or worse ( there's both great Jewish jokes and crazy pedophile jokes in one-minute of time ) . But one thing that it can't be called is ingenuous . This is the real-deal in sketch comedy , and the writing is irreverence squared . Adding on to tis is the wonderful , classic presence of Carlin ( who originally would've been in skits had it not been for his cocaine habit at the time ) , who goes through Baseball and Football and his first thoughts on God to the New York audience . Even in this coked-up state he's on fire , in a laid-back sort of way .

He created his own universe , a nocturnal and filthy one , and a bit misogynous too : it's glaring in this movie ; outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk - , only a black woman has a line to say . Almost everywhere , it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings . This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors : of course "" Dr Jekill and Mister Hide "" to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant , "" a clockwork orange "" , "" rebel without a cause "" "" bad influence "" and Joel Schumacher's "" falling down "" , the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated . So why does this movie seem so original ? it owes a lot to E . Norton ( more than Pitt ) who had already overshadowed R . Gere in "" primal fear "" . Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom : watching mental suffering ( therapy groups , dealing almost essentially with male problems ) , then physical sufferings , eventually enduring them . Does he do that as he would opt for yoga , Buddhism or psychotherapy , to escape from a routine work ? To get free from the material world ? As Pitt says "" the things you . . .

At first , he may be , when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor - , but , he's potentially a Stevensonian hero .

They talk process , the freedom that Scott allows , and there is , of course , some of the obligatory love-fest . It's quite informative , thorough , and it can be entertaining , as well . I recommend it to any fan of those who helped to put the title together , and / or anyone who wants to know more about it .

438,"Text1: A simply spectacular 70's women-in-prison drive-in gem Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid . Beauteous Russ Meyer starlet Eric ( "" Vixen , "" "" Beyond the Valley of the Dolls "" ) Gavin gives a robust , winning performance as a brassy , resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy , hellish penitentiary . The always fabulous Barbara Steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean , crippled , sexually frustrated warden ( her erotic dream about doing a slow , steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly ) . Longtime favorite 70's B-movie actress Roberta ( "" The Arousers , "" "" Unholy Rollers "" ) Collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward , foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about Pinnochio . Lynda Gold ( a . k . a . Crystin Sinclaire of Tobe Hooper's "" Eaten Alive "" and Curtis Harrington's "" Ruby "" ) makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat Crazy Alice . And the ever-cuddly Cheryl "" Rainbeaux "" Smith does a lovely , touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from "" Lemora : A Child's Tale of the Supernatural . "" Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language , nudity , rape and violence , it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth ; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force . Demme's zesty , confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior . Furthermore , both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and John Cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100 % on the money excellent . Patrick Wright ( Sheriff Mack in the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler "" Track of the Moonbeast "" ) has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom . Lively , rousing and immensely enjoyable , "" Caged Heat "" qualifies as absolutely essential viewing for 70's drive-in movie fans .


Text2: A truly terrific & delightful slice of rock history drama gem The chronically under-appreciated Illeana Douglas gives a characteristically glowing , winsome , totally spot-on performance as aspiring singer / songwriter Denise Waverly , who during a very turbulent and wildly eventful fifteen year time span goes from being a frustrated , creatively stifled behind-the-scenes magic maker to eventually acquiring the clout and courage to branch out on her own to sing her own material in a strong , assertive , independent female voice . Learning under the expert tutelage of cranky , eccentric , misanthropic Brill Building impresario Joel Millner ( a fabulously freaky John Turturro ) and enduring a steady succession of unsuccessful romantic relationships with footloose , insecure , insensitive bohemian songwriter Howard Castatt ( a perfectly jerky Eric Stoltz ) , conventional married disc jockey John Murray ( a typically fine Bruce Davison ) , and brilliantly innovative , but paranoid and temperamental surf-rock composer Jay Phillips ( a splendidly spaced-out Matt Dillon ) , the extremely intelligent and resilient Denise uses her bittersweet life experiences as prime fodder for her ever evolving and emotionally charged songs . Flavorfully documenting rock music's growth from effervescent girl group pop to trippy psychedelic experimentation to intensely personal singer / songwriter confessional tunes , Allison Anders ' simply sensational feature , loosely based on the real-life exploits of Carole King ( besides the obviously King-influenced Denise , most of the other characters are clearly composites of various actual rock people as well ) and executive produced by Martin Scorsesse , crackles with all the joyous vibrancy and infectious exuberance of the marvelously dynamic and exciting music scene its set in . Anders ' deft , assured direction and sharply perceptive script , both keenly tuned in to the mercurial zeitgeist of the 60's and the then burgeoning women's right movement , works as both invigorating rock music history and inspirational pro-feminist tract alike . The splendidly catchy and melodious Larry Klein-produced soundtrack , Jean Yves Escoffier's smooth , agile , gliding cinematography , a story which manages to be genuinely touching without ever lapsing into mawkishly contrived sentiment , an absorbing , minutely detailed backstage glimpse at the pop music songwriting and recording process , and the uniformly superlative acting - - Patsy Kensit as Denise's longtime songwriting partner and loyal gal pal Cheryl Steed , Bridget Fonda as awkward closeted lesbian pop singer Kelly Porter , and David Clennon as a flaky hippie shrink are especially terrific - - round out this positively radiant and utterly delightful gem .

Text2: Herbie goes to high school ! First and foremost I wish to aim a big & mean middle-finger towards the Troma DVD-distribution crew , who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's pivot killer on the back of the cover ! The synopsis just randomly mentions who's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day , for Christ's sake ! I don't care how terrible or how predictable an 80's slasher can be ; just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point ! So , a word of advise in case you also purchase the Troma double-feature containing "" Graduation Day "" and "" Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell "" , do not ? repeat DO NOT ? turn the box around and read the back ! Watching the film is already a painful experience , but reading the back would really spoil everything . Now , as for the actual the actual movie ? Oh boy ! Personally I'm a fan of the cinematic ' work ' of Herb Freed . Well actually , I don't really know whether I should admire him ? or pity him ! All Herb's films are pretty bad & amateurish , but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions ! Unlike with "" Haunts "" and "" Beyond Evil "" , he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high-school slasher films . Just to offer a minimum of originality , all the victims in "" Graduation Day "" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach George Michaels ( awesome name ! I guess Herb Freed is a fan of "" Wham ! "" ) . During the opening credits , we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field , moments after winning a 30 seconds running race . The debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team-members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised , but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he / she considers responsible for Laura's death . What a demented little movie ! The script must be one of the most incoherent ones I ever beheld , with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words ! There's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin , others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes ! Herb concentrates on the ingeniousness & the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film ! For example , Laura's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death . Halfway through the movie , however , her character hardly appears in the movie anymore . Also , the girls ' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well . Instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings , we're served disco-dancing & roller-skating sequences and ? of course ? numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks stripping their tops off . Despite being really bad , "" Graduation Day "" could count on a respectable cast ! Christopher George ( "" Grizzly "" , "" City of the Living Dead "" ) greatly stars as the demanding coach , Carmen Argenziano ( "" When a Stranger Calls "" , "" The Accused "" ) briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ( "" Dead & Buried "" , "" Dracula's Dog "" ) has a very amusing part as the school's stressed out principal . The teenage beauties on duty include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White . Heck , for some horror fans , the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count "" Graduation Day "" among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's . It's a dumb film , but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed !

440,"Text1: Cribb's Social Problems , and 19th Century Pugilism This novel-turned-to-television play is set in the late 1870s . At that time pugilism , which was about to be organized by the Marquis of Queensbury's rules , was turning away from the old fashioned style of boxing called "" bare-knuckled "" boxing . Before one boxed with boxing gloves the boxers hit each other without any protective gear . It was very bloody as a result - in fact the boxers had a good chance of doing permanent damage to each other's faces , as well as to their hands . So it was considered very dangerous and forbidden by law . But there were boxing fans who were willing to pay a great deal of money to see the old fashioned "" bare-knuckled "" fights . This is the background of THE DETECTIVE WORE SILK DRAWERS . Cribb and Thackeray are sent by Jowett to investigate the discoveries in the Thames of the beheaded bodies of several men - who appear to be pugilists . From the states of their bodies they have been involved in bare-knuckled fighting . So Cribb is disguised as a fight manager - promoter . Assigned to help him is Constable Henry Jago , a new police officer who is the champion amateur boxer of Scotland Yard . He is to be Cribb's pug , whom Cribb is to try to get into the illegal fights . Hopefully he will find who is putting on the illegal fights , and is responsible for the murders . The twist in this story is that Jago is under Cribb in this investigation , but is treated with more deference than Cribb by Jowett . It seems Jago is from the upper middle class , and ( as I have mentioned in other reviews of this series ) Cribb is lower class . This will have an effect at the end of the story that is natural for the age of Victorian England , but certainly less than fair to the fans of the Sergeant .


Text2: A Social Drama Curiosity of the 1930s This was the second of the series of re-released , long missing films shown on Wednesday , April 2 , 2007 on Turner Classic films . RAFTER ROMANCE had a good deal of pleasant humor still going for it , and A MAN'S JOURNEY has some wonderful performances and a good story . But DOUBLE HARNESS , although it has two good performances ( especially Ann Harding's ) from it's leads has a script that most people would not accept . Family and filial devotion are still big matters to people today , but this film stretches these points way out of proportion . Harding is the older of the two daughters of Henry Stephenson . The younger one is Lucille Brown . As the film begins we see Harding with Stephenson and Brown buying Brown's wedding trousseau . Stephenson is a decent sort ( when was he not in most of his films ? ) but he has never been really astute about money matters , and so he is only able to afford $5 , 000 . 00 ( 1933 dollars , of course ) for the weddings of both daughters together . But dear little Brown is spending more than her $2 , 500 . 00 share . Harding realizes this , and is a good sport - she let's this shopping spree eat up more than of the total . After all , little sister is getting married . Harding is asked by Stephenson and by Brown about her own marriage plans . She has been dating William Powell , a well-known playboy type , but one who actually has a business - a potentially important shipping line that Powell has allowed to be run by others , and is now somewhat shabby . It turns out that Harding actually has her own agenda . She sees that marriage by itself ( supposedly based on love ) is insufficient , unless the wife can be of use to bring out the best in the husband not only at home but in his career ( this film is very much a 1930s film - the idea of the woman building her career is not part of the picture ) . Powell is enjoying dating Harding , and it goes beyond a casual , more typical affair of a few days or weeks . But she sets him up ( with the aid of her sister and Stephenson ) . Powell has brought her to his apartment on several occasions ( and we imagine it is for more than the cocktails served to them by his butler , Reginald Owen ) , but one night Stephenson shows up as the angry , red-faced father ( signalled to come by Brown after Harding calls Brown up ) . Stephenson acts as though he is furious , and wants to know the intentions of both Powell and Harding : how do they feel about each other , and will they marry or not ? Harding admits she loves Powell , and would marry him , but it is up to him to decide . Flummoxed by the suddenness of the situation , Powell says he wants to marry too . So now the marriage can go through . Now the title of the film is understandable , as the marriage is the "" double harness "" of the couple . But the problems are these . No matter how fond he is of Harding , and willing to go through the forms , Powell intends it to be a short duration marriage . Harding is discovering that she is slowly falling in love with Powell , and is also aware that he expects her to divorce him within a six months of their return from their honeymoon ( on one of his cruise lines ships ) . She gets to work to remake him racing against time - if she can domesticate him ( and make him see he likes it ) she can save the marriage . She also starts pushing him to get re-involved with the shipping line , and he starts taking charge of it ( and it starts improving ) . Only two things may derail Harding's plans . One is the reappearance of one of the wealthy women ( Lillian Bond ) who thrived with Powell ( or seemed to do so ) when he was a playboy . She starts being seen around town with Powell , although he is simply being polite in taking her to lunch at such . The other thing is Lucille Brown . Her marriage to George Meeker is in jeopardy ( again we see no scenes about this ) because she","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Lee Marvin isn't a very accomplished singer , either . And the two miscast leads aren't the only problems of this musical-Western . It's also pointless , slow and plodding .

There are only four characters , and they are all effectively performed ( and yes : Goya Toledo IS a sensual woman ) . The film is also stylishly directed and photographed . One minor point : the word game that Grandinetti and Toledo frequently play won't mean much to non-Spanish-speaking audiences .

He is infatuated with her and she probably barely ever notices him . He even goes so far as to hang out in the same bar she frequents after work on Fridays .

And , in the meantime , you hear his thoughts as he castigates himself for being weak as well as telling himself that no woman would want a man like him . It's all quite sad but I liked the film for two main reasons . First , many people are like this shy guy - - living in desperation and yet doing nothing to change their lives . Second , and more importantly , the film makers do not cop out and give the film a happy and unrealistic ending . No , instead , you feel for him but are left wondering if he'll ever do anything more with his life .

The fact that Steven Soderbergh produced this small , low budget work should indicate the quality of endorsement a fine filmmaker has in a relatively unknown writer and director . Essentially a one-man drama , the ' story ' is more an autopsy on the mind of a disturbed 36-year-old man William Keane ( Damian Lewis ) who lives in the streets and underground of New York , whispering to himself the data of a child snatching incident ' last September ' : we slowly get the idea that Keane's 7 year old daughter Sophie disappeared at station 8 at 4 : 30 PM . Keane lives his life searching for his daughter , watching , ' being watched ' , and in general appearing like a mentally challenged man on desperate treadmill . Keane lives in a rent by night hotel and at one point overhears a young woman Lynn ( Amy Ryan ) arguing with the deskman about her rent : she is accompanied by a seven year old child Kira ( Abigail Breslin ) and Keane follows them to their room and genuinely offers Lynn $200 . ' to help them out ' . Wary at first , Lynn accepts the money , eventually invites Keane to her apartment for shared take-out supper , and Keane warmly relates to both Lynn and Kira . At one point Lynn asks Keane to watch Kira for an afternoon and Keane and Kira enjoy each other's company in what results in an extended time due to Lynn's unexpected absence ( she has been visiting her estranged husband arranging for them to reunite ) . Lynn finally returns and thanks Keane for his kindness and informs him that the two are departing the next day to re-join her husband . Keane asks for one last goodbye to Kira , a child he has grown love and who is the one who brings him as close to sanity as any person has been able . It is the manner in which Keane and Kira spend that last goodbye that forms the suspenseful ending to the film . Some reviewers feel that not much happens in this story and I suppose that linearly speaking , not much does . But the spectrum of intensely difficult psychological journey with which we accompany Keane is extraordinary . Damian Lewis carries this film with a breathlessly credible performance of a man lost in the no man's land of mental deterioration , drugs , and alcohol . Thankfully Kerrigan never force-feeds us Keane's background except for a brief moment in which Keane recounts the dates of his birth and sadly unremarkable events of his life . The rest is left to the viewer to mold from the pitiful fragments Keane dispenses through his actions and reactions . The supporting cast is strong and the technical aspects of the film are well captured . This film may be too tough for most viewers who expect more information in a story , but for those brave enough to enter the mind of a mentally disturbed man and view the world through his perceptions and fears and needs , so brilliantly enacted by Damian Lewis , this film will stay in memory .

In that regard , "" Jet Li's Fearless "" is acceptable on both points , even though the plot itself is reminiscent of movies going all the way back to the kung fu glut of the 1970's . It has a much harder edge to it than the lyrical beauty of a movie like "" Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon "" , and it doesn't approach the vibrant use of color that "" Hero "" and "" House of Flying Daggers "" so eminently achieve . What it does serve up are excitingly well choreographed fights in various venues that push the limits of physical dexterity and inventive use of wire work ; the battle against Master Chin at the restaurant best exemplifies that dichotomy .

Of Tondelayo , she would later say , ' I thought with some interesting make-up , a sarong and some hip-swinging I would be a memorable nymphomaniac . ' Obviously , despite her intelligence , Hedy had a problem judging scripts . "" Just let me conclude by saying that all of the performances are embarrisingly inept , the script is hopelessly full of clich√©s , and the direction allows everyone to overact in such melodramatic silent screen fashion that it's a wonder anyone had a reputation left after this foolishness was over - - including director Richard Thorpe who had better films in his future . Unless Hedy in dark make-up and sarong is enough to hold your interest , WHITE CARGO is better left among the dustbins of film memories .


Text2: TNT premiere showing of "" Shattered "" . . . The producers of BUTTERFLY ON A WHEEL ( a / k / a SHATTERED in U . S . ) , didn't have enough faith in their project to seek widespread theatrical distribution of the finished film - - even though it had GERARD BUTLER fresh from his box-office triumph in "" 300 "" . Instead , they went a more direct route - - directly to TV on TNT , which seems more like a last resort . Once again , a Gerard Butler film with limited distribution even though co-starred with PIERCE BROSNAN and MARIA BELLO . Seeing it on TNT , it's understandable that the film had some problems in connecting with a larger audience . Brosnan's villain is below par for the actor and Butler has done better work elsewhere although he gives all his energy to the role of a distraught husband . The plot is an elaborate cat-and-mouse game that Brosnan plays with the unlucky couple , Butler and Bello . While it does generate a certain amount of suspense , Brosnan's character remains an enigma for almost the whole story . Never once do we get a hint of why he's going to such extremes to torture the couple by demanding that they perform tasks at his bidding . A grungy looking Brosnan makes the villain a very unappetizing psychotic and we're never quite sure about Butler either , an ad agency man who gradually loses his swaggering overconfident manner . Without giving away more of the plot ( except to say that there is a mildly interesting twist toward the end followed by a double twist ) , the whole thing plays more like a made-for-TV movie than an actual film because none of the characters are more than one-dimensional despite the good acting . And the final scene between Butler and Bello is totally unbelievable as to motivation . Summing up : Basically tricky and shallow at the core .

451,"Text1: Brass ' controversial Nazi-sleazefest Made a few years before the even more notorious ' Caligula ' , this ' Salon Kitty ' focuses on a more recent era of despicable history . Set in the earliest years of Hitler's reign and the start of WWII , it handles about power-mad Nazi officer Wallenberg who puts Madame Kitty's luxurious brothel in service of the ' Third Reich ' and recruits a bunch of patriotic beauties to serve as prostitutes . But , instead of doing this as a favor for his fellow Nazi-superiors , he blackmails them with the information he gets by having the chambers bugged . This film is infamous and hated because of its topic ( I always heard it was as close to propaganda as you can get ) and the explicitly of the sexual content . Granted , Tinto Brass does have a bizarre obsession for showing as much genitalia ( female AND male ) as possible but aside from a few sequences featuring deformed midgets , it's never too sickening . The dullness is what bothered me here ! The film is overlong and I wasn't really anticipating all those Cabaret sequences . The screenplay too often handles about pointless intrigues and the plot only gets REALLY interesting around the last half hour when SPOILERS the young Margherita unravels Wallenberg's vile actions and conspiracies against him . End Spoilers . Thank God for Theresa Ann Savoy ! This stunning beauty ( who also played a remarkable role in ' Caligula ' ) makes this exploitation experience ten times more bearable because of her natural charisma and ravishing body . If it weren't for her , I'm sure the ratings for this film would be even lower .


Text2: There's always room for one more . . . MANIAC ! The almighty Hershell Gordon-Lewis already promised us through a very catchy song that the South was going to rise again . . . and it did ! Slightly more than forty years after the Godfather of Gore's terrific splatter-classic , energetic director Tim Sullivan gathered quite an impressive cast and updated Lewis ' screenplay with new gory sickness and nowadays sleaze ' n swearing ! I'm usually not this enthusiastic when it comes to remakes of classic horror films , but "" 2001 Maniacs "" simply is a fun & unpretentious little movie that clearly intended to please horror fans first , rather than to hit big at the box office . The original story is preserved , as a whole bunch of young party animals on their way to the Southern beaches are detoured the peculiar little town of Pleasant Valley where they're given a warm reception as honoree guests to a local jubilee . The townsfolk , with one-eyed mayor Buckman in charge , all soon turn out to be deranged killers that are still very rancorous about the Southern Civil War casualties and , one by one , the Yankee tourists are butchered in very imaginative ways . Some of the killings are strangely similar to the ones in Lewis ' original , some of them are completely new . . . but they ALL are utterly grotesque and exhilaratingly gross ! Whenever there isn't any gore on display , we're treated to absurd dialogues , morbid jokes and ? oh yeah ? loads of naked flesh supplied by the most ravishing babes of nowadays horror flicks . Of course , purely talking cinema , this isn't much of good film because it totally lacks tension and it's tasteless , offensive and completely ridiculous . Personally I couldn't care less about this because A ) you pretty much know what to expect here and B ) it's a splendid throwback to the rancid 60's and 70's ; the times when horror cinema didn't necessarily had to justify its exploitative tendencies . Robert Englund clearly hasn't had this much fun portraying a mad character than since the original "" Nightmare on Elm Street "" and Lin Shaye once again proves she's a sadly underrated but great actress that delivers no matter how silly her lines are . The younger cast members perform adequately and Sullivan's directing is fairly surefooted as well . Although the additional maniac in the title never really gets introduced , I suppose it relates to the little silent girl who dissects rats for fun . "" 2001 Maniacs "" is one of the most entertaining horror films of the past couple of years and I recommend it highly !

It's well-produced throughout and leaves little to be desired . It is more about the life and accomplishments of Hearst than Welles , but that can be argued as fitting , as that was whom the film in question was intended to be a biography of ( if it turned out to be a bit of a misunderstood attempt at so , masterful effort though it is , and in the end actually is closer to the real persona , past and then-future of its maker ) . We are given a lot of insight into both of them , who they were , what drove them , their triumphs and defeat . It's all told rather well , with clips of the movie itself ( as well as others , where it fits ) , interviews , past as well as current , with those who worked with them ( and even one of Orson himself , from ' 82 ) , footage from behind the scenes , stills and narration . A number of the many shocks the two caused , including the ( in ) famous War of the Worlds broadcast , are detailed , with witness accounts where possible .

Text2: "" Why , Tony , why ? "" Having not really seen any other Tony Scott films than Enemy of the State , I didn't entirely know what to expect from his new revenge / vigilante action-drama , but the trailers looked so darn promising , so I thought , "" what the heck . . . can't be all bad . . . "" Believe me , I've learned my lesson ; never judge a film by its trailer . The film is decent at best , overlong and it jerks the audience's sympathies around , without delivering any actual action . The plot is pretty good , but why does it take so ridiculously long to take off ? My gosh , I was halfway through the film and almost falling asleep before something happened that wasn't just character development for Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning's characters . When the revenge actually took place , I sat there , in the theater , attentively , and really expecting something awesome to happen . But it didn't . I waited through the rest of the film , and nothing remarkable happened . There are "" action "" scenes ( if you can call a bunch of large explosions ' action ' ) , but they aren't actually impressive , as they appear in the trailers . The acting is pretty good . The characters are somewhat well-written . The pacing is dreadful . The film seems to never actually take shape and be anything . . . first it's a character driven drama , then an action piece , then a character driven drama again . . . and it keeps jerking our sympathies around , until the audience don't care about anything but when the film ends . The cinematography is pretty good , but it keeps cutting and skipping and it winds up giving you a headache . Once the revenge starts , Scott overstylizes the crap out of every moment , presumably because he didn't get to do his thing before that point in the film . The ending was probably the worst piece of typical Hollywood crap I've seen for a while . What kind of supposed feel-good crap . . . how are we supposed to believe that ? If you see this movie , you'll know exactly what I mean . In conclusion , Tony can direct action decently , but he should stay far away from character driven pieces for a while . After seeing the film , leaving the theater , thinking more and more about it , I realize that I sympathize more with the kidnappers than the main characters . That's not as much the fault of Tony Scott the director as Tony Scott the human being , though . He expects us to care about this family just because they're the main characters , while the villains in the film have it much worse than they do . Bad idea , Mr . Scott . All in all , a decent film , but not one I care to see again , and not one I would classify as ' action ' . Not even partly . I recommend this only to big fans of the actors and director Tony Scott . Everyone else , smell the smoke and realize that this is a dud .

Basically this is a movie that thinks it's clever by trying to shock people and thinking they'll laugh at it . I was disgusted and didn't laugh once . The movie is morbid , disturbing and ( surprisingly ) dull . The cast is the only thing that kept me watching . Segal and Gordon were both wonderful in their roles - - Gordon especially .

Her sense of pacing and image creation adds substance to her tales that sometimes border on bizarre . DEATH DEFYING ACTS uses the character of Harry Houdini as the stimulus of to tell a story about the folk of Edinburgh , Scotland at a time when stage shows were embraced much the way America was using vaudeville - an escape from the rather dreary state of living to a world of entertainment and love of magic . Mary McGarvie ( Catherine Zeta-Jones ) and her daughter Benji ( Saoirse Ronan ) survive in Edinburgh by picking pockets not merely for cash but for information to use in their act in the little theaters . Mary does exotic dances then uses her ' gifts ' to see into the ' other world ' of people in the audience ( Benji does the investigative work and is the prompter for the s√©ance like acts Mary performs ) . Their idol is Harry Houdini ( Guy Pearce ) and when they learn Houdini is coming to Edinburgh to ' perform ' , they discover Houdini is promising $10 , 000 to anyone who can prove they have the ability to look into the future ( or past ) . Houdini's manager Sugarman ( Timothy Spall ) arranges Houdini's water tank escape acts and other acts of ' magic ' , and when Mary and Benji arrange to meet Houdini , Sugarman is aware they are charlatans . How Mary and Benji work their way into Houdini's belief system and love life with their con game forms the meat of the sparing . The atmosphere of the film is well captured by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos who understands who to balance the mire of the streets of 1926 Edinburgh with the gorgeous fantasies used during Houdini's escape acts . The musical score by Cezary Skubiszewski is a terrific mixture of Scottish tunes and instruments with solid melodramatic mood music . Pearce , Zeta-Jones , Spall and Ronan turn in excellent performances . This is an unjustly overlooked film that , while not being a masterpiece , serves up a fine story well told . Grady Harp


Text2: A Used Story , Used Production Techniques : A Tired Movie BEEPER is the product of those films that deal with kidnapping of a child with the only connection with the perpetrators being by cell phone or other mechanical devices supposedly to enhance the tension of identifying the bad guy . By now the story is so used and tired that it takes a spectacular gimmick to make it fly . BEEPER remains grounded . Dr . Richard Avery ( Ed Quinn , known to only those who watch TV ) flies to India with his young son ( he is a widower ) to give a lecture at a worldwide medical conference . In the audience the son Sam ( Stefan Djordjevic ) disappears and the good doctor notices too late , beginning a long series of chases to find Sam . Avery encounters Sr . Inspector Vijay Kumar ( Gulshan Grover ) , whose specialty is drug dealing problems , and Inspector Julia Hyde ( Joey Lauren Adams ) , whose specialty is kidnapping . But Avery is informed that he is to follow instructions given through a beeper and to avoid the police . Avery finds his only source of information is through Zolo ( Harvey Keitel ) , a drug lord in Delhi who has special interests in fulfilling the ransom : cash for opium . After an endless car chase through the streets and markets of Delhi the truth about who is the real kidnapper is revealed . . . and the movie glides to a bumpy end . Seeing India as a backdrop for an intrigue film is promising but visually this viewer gets the feeling that much of the footage is actually from a can rather than being on set . The acting ranges from fair to really awful and the script by Michael Cordell and Gregory Gieras is dreary . Made in 2002 and just released on DVD it is not a secret why the movie didn't make it in the theaters . Even the usually reliable Keitel can't save this one . Grady Harp

This highly imaginative cartoon is told almost entirely using stop-motion animation . What makes it especially unusual & fun is that the characters , human and animal , are constructed out of odds ' n ' ends : corks , pipe cleaners , pencils , forks , hair pins , etc . giving the well known Biblical tale a sense of whimsy . Then , there's the female hippo that sings the blues . . . Jerome Courtland is the narrator ; among the other voices can be heard those of Paul Frees ( as Noah ) and Thurl Ravenscroft . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a storm of naysayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .


Text2: Karloff & Daniell Haunt Old Edinburgh THE BODY SNATCHER who supplies fresh corpses for an Edinburgh doctor in 1831 soon adds blackmail & murder to his iniquitous deeds . This was one of a short series of horror films in which Boris Karloff starred for producer Val Lewton , the others being ISLE OF THE DEAD ( 1945 ) & BEDLAM ( 1946 ) . Lewton had the knack of producing films full of atmosphere & menace on a very low budget and THE BODY SNATCHER is no exception , getting most of its chills from the wonderful acting and the literate , intelligent script - although the climax is genuinely terrifying . Karloff is chillingly perfection in the role of the sly coachman who augments his salary with a little grave robbing . A gentle man who is kind to crippled children , yet can murder without a second thought , Karloff paints the cunning portrait of a very human monster . Every step of the way , however , he is equaled by Henry Daniell , a wonderful British character actor who never received due recognition for his skills . Playing a brilliant anatomist who feels he must continue to use Karloff's gruesome deliveries for the light they shine on solving medical problems , Daniell delivers an elegant portrayal of a deeply conflicted man who is pulled ever nearer the center of the vortex . In a relatively small role - his last with Karloff - Bela Lugosi is memorable as a greedy servant who tries blackmail at the worst possible time . Russell Wade as a medical student and Rita Corday as a young patient's widowed mother help move the plot along , but wisely no romantic subplot is allowed to develop . Edith Atwater does very well as Daniell's housekeeper , a woman with many secrets . Movie mavens will recognize elderly Mary Gordon , unbilled as the pathetic mother at Greyfriars graveyard . At one time , the bodies of executed prisoners supplied the medical schools of Britain with all the corpses they could use for the purposes of dissecting & lecturing . But judicial reform nearly dried up the flow of bodies from that source , while the proliferation of new schools and anatomy theatres made the shortage acute . The medieval laws still on the books made the legal acquirement of bodies almost impossible . The ghastly vocation of body snatching thus arose to fill this void . Body Snatchers - also referred to as grave robbers , resurrectionists , or Sack ' Em Up Boys - would haunt cemeteries by night , looking for the recently deceased to disinter . Often the caretakers in the graveyards would be in financial league with these hooligans , as well as the doctors at the medical schools . Prices paid for the bodies could be quite exorbitant , considering the risks that were taken . Leaving dogs or spring-loaded guns at the graveside were just some of the elaborate precautions taken by the friends of the deceased , who often kept vigil by the graves until enough time had passed to make the corpse no longer desirable . Eventually , it became quite difficult to count on the graveyards to furnish enough fodder for the grisly trade . ' The ruffian dogs , the hellish pair , The villain Burke , the meager Hare . . . Nor did they handle ax or knife To take away their victim's life . . . No sooner done than in the chest They crammed their lately welcome guest . . .

Delighted with this easy money , the nefarious pair soon took to hastening the deaths of their ' subjects . ' At least 15 hapless victims were lured into the lodging house and smothered ( so as to leave no sign of violence on their flesh ) , the bodies then sold to respected surgeon Robert Knox . On Halloween in 1828 , suspicious neighbors summoned police and enough evidence was found to immediately arrest Burke & Hare . At the trial , Hare turned King's evidence and admitted to the murders .

With all the abrupt plot-twists and the extremely violent death-sequences , you could almost describe "" Amsterdamned "" as the only Dutch GIALLO ever made and it's perfectly able to compete with some of the better Italian efforts in this lovely sub genre of horror . Even the chilling musical score ( composed by Dick Maas himself , as well ) feels very giallo-like . Of course , the film isn't entirely flawless . Some action scenes ( like the grotesque speed-boat chase ) are just a tad bit exaggerated and the one many red herrings eventually ruin the credibility .

Text2: Above average entry . This is the one in which Robert Culp is a murderous motivational research scientist who uses subliminal cuts in an advertising film to lure his victim , Robert Middleton , out into the lobby of the screening room . It's pretty good too . Culp is a cool , thoroughly organized killer . He's more amused by Columbo's antics than irritated by them - - except when they screw up his golf game . And it has two truly likable supporting players : Chuck McCann and Louise Latham . McCann is intrinsically funny . There's something about his clown-like smile and the blubber that surrounds it that evokes smiles in his audience . He had a children's TV show in New York that was so outrageous that , even as an adult , I caught it whenever I could . Louise Latham will be immediately recognizable . She's not at all unattractive although her eyes almost meet each other , separated only by the thin bridge of her nose . As an actress , she's hard to beat . Her range is from mean and Southern to vulnerable and appealing , as she is here . I hope no one takes this subliminal motivation business too seriously . The impact is debatable but no one has claimed it can be used in a conspiracy to corrupt the population or get everyone to rush out and buy Nokia . I used a tachistoscope in some studies at Cornell and the results were minimal - - probably real for some people , but not very important .

It's up to Dick Tracy to unravel the mystery . - I have now seen four of these Dick Tracy movies from the 1940s and this is easily my least favorite . Dick Tracy's Dilemma seems tired and offers very few fresh ideas . It's a shame that a really nasty villain like The Claw wasn't in a movie with a better story .

Text2: "" I'll rise but I refuse to shine ! "" "" Been There , Done That "" is the Xena take on the movie Groundhog Day . Unbeknownst to her companions , Gabrielle and Joxer , Xena is reliving the same day over and over until she manages to get things right . In this case , getting things right includes stopping the local townspeople from killing Gabrielle and / or Joxer who just happen to be caught in the middle of a feud between competing families . To accomplish this , Xena must discover the root cause of the feud and intervene before things get out of hand . As with Groundhog Day , the repeating day concept presents several opportunities for humor and , fortunately , the Xena writers didn't miss any of them . The funniest bit for me was waiting to see how Xena would handle Gabrielle and Joxer each morning to keep them safe and out of trouble . The sight of the pair bound and gagged with looks of outright astonishment on their faces is laugh-out-loud funny . The entire episode is very nicely done . I may have missed "" Been There , Done That "" when the series first aired , but it has now become one of my all-time favorite Xena episodes . Good stuff !

Text2: Engaging and Different Movie About the Lives of Three Women ' Personal Velocity : Three Portraits ' is an engaging and different movie about the lives of three women . With great direction , camera , narration and performance of the cast , it hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene . The stories have in common an accident and three woman intending to change their lives leaving their mates . Delia ( Kyra Sedgwick ) is the daughter of a hippie , abused in her adolescence by her friends , married with a former boy-friend of high-school and having three children . She leaves her husband , who beats her , with the children . In a new town , beginning a new life working as a waitress and living on favor in the garage of a high school friend , she repeats the same mistake of her youth . Greta ( Parker Posey ) is an editor , who has never gotten close to her father after his divorce of her mother . She is married with a simple guy who loves her , but she is sort of nymphomaniac . When she becomes successful in her career , she gets closer to her father again and returns to her former ambitious way of life . Paula ( Fairuza Balk ) is a woman who left her family and moved alone to Manhattan . She is rescued from the streets by a man , and starts living with him . When she gets pregnant , she becomes confused with the situation and leaves home . An accident first and an incident with a lonely and wounded boy later helps her to decide her destiny . ' Personal Velocity : Three Portraits ' is a nice and attractive independent low budget movie . I have really not understood why the stories are narrated by a man , since they are about women .

462,"Text1: A brilliant slice of life . . . excellent performances . . . No film in recent years has held me as spellbound as SLING BLADE , written by BILLY BOB THORNTON ( for which he won an Oscar for Best Screenplay ) , and starring the actor in a memorable role for which he was Oscar nominated but failed to win . He becomes the character with such truth - - and such emotional underplaying - - that he makes the whole story even more moving than it would have been with any other actor in the leading role . He plays a retarded man released from prison after serving twenty-five years for killing his mother and her lover with a sling blade . He felt morally justified because he saw their act of love as evil , only later realizing that it was wrong to kill them . We follow his release , first accepted with kindness by a local repair shop where he reveals himself to be skilled at fixing motors , then received into the family of a boy he's befriended , played wonderfully by LUCAS BLACK . Unfortunately , the family life is ruined by a violently dysfunctional man called Doyle ( DWIGHT YOAKAM ) who is a crude bully and redneck full of bitter hatred and resenting the intrusion of Thornton and the boy and possessive in his relationship with the mother . The biggest weakness in the screenplay is figuring out why the mother would ever be attracted by such a bigoted bully . Yoakam plays him in a ruthless manner that shows no compassion for the character and he's so evil that you have to wonder about the mother's mental faculties in letting him even near the family . It's also hard to believe that she would let the retired man use her garage for shelter on such short acquaintance with her son . But hey , this is a movie , this is the script , and that's it . All of the acting is uniformly excellent , particularly BILLY BOB THORNTON , who was nominated and would have deserved the Oscar for his penetrating study of a retarded man without a single false note . Tension builds because the viewer is aware that some sort of confrontation has to happen between Karl ( Thornton ) and Doyle . It's a matter of waiting to see what develops and that's what keeps the viewer hooked onto the story and wondering how it will conclude . It's a fully realized slice of life , Southern style with hillbilly overtones , always centered on the main thrust of the story without ever losing its touch , rich in atmospheric detail . J . T . WALSH as a fellow inmate is impressive , as is JOHN RITTER ( whom I didn't even recognize at first ) as a sympathetic gay man , amazingly real in a serious role . ROBERT DUVALL has a cameo bit as an indifferent father that he plays faultlessly . Summing up : Brilliant film , highly recommended and involving a very touching relationship between the small boy and the retarded man .


Text2: Hollywood's early sound version is strictly for the birds . . . I'm told that JOHN BARRYMORE was once a great actor . There is little evidence for this claim offered here . His entire performance has the flavor of smokehouse ham all the way , even given to over-the-top acrobatics on the ship's crows nest . He squints his eyes , widens them when angry , snarls all of his dialog in a theatrical manner , and then we're supposed to believe that a beautiful young girl ( JOAN BENNETT at twenty ) is so charmed by his dashing appearance that she falls instantly in love with him . The only impressive things about the film are the settings , the photography and the all too brief moments at sea where Captain Ahab comes into contact with the great white whale . But for a film about Melville's famous whaler , it spends very little time at sea . Most of the story is taken up by a conventional three-way romance that is pure Hollywood hokum . Bennett was a very beautiful young girl but there's a strange quality about the way she uses her voice - - "" talkies "" being new , this is , I suppose , forgivable . She seems to be acting in a stage play rather than a movie - - but then , so is Barrymore . Summing up : Primitive attempt to present Melville to ' 30s audiences , leaving out most of the plot , substituting motivations and adding love interest . A yawner except for the sea scenes .

"" Man on Wire "" is a documentary account of Petit's stunt , focusing primarily on the preparations for it and detailing how he and his team of four snuck on to the roof of the towers in the first place . Let's just say that times have changed . Obviously , the twin towers are no longer there , but if they were , you can be sure it would not be as easy to stroll right in as it was for Petit and his crew . Petit was obviously a man obsessed with a goal , but those who come into the film wondering exactly why he was obsessed with this particular goal will come away still wondering . As Petit says at one point , it's a typically American question to ask "" why ? "" in relation to something like this rather than simply enjoy the beauty of it . I can't believe Werner Herzog didn't get his hands on this story first , as the man obsessed angle would seem to be right up his alley .


Text2: James Stewart and His Giant Bunny Are Absolutely Charming James Stewart plays gentle soul Elwood P . Dowd in this charming , benevolent comedy spiced with hints of fantasy . Elwood is an eccentric man who consorts with an invisible 6 foot tall ( or 6 ' 3 "" tall , to be exact ) rabbit named Harvey , much to the dismay of his sister and niece . They spend much of the film trying to have him committed to an institution so that he'll stop being an embarrassment to them , but their plans don't work , mostly because everyone with whom Elwood comes in contact is utterly beguiled by him . Elwood isn't "" normal "" like all of the other characters in the movie , meaning he's not uptight , cruel and worried about what others think of him . The movie asks its audience : would you rather be like Elwood or would you rather be "" normal "" ? Give me a giant invisible rabbit any day over the fussy characters with whom Elwood has to contend . It would be easy to dismiss Stewart's performance as too easy for him , as many critics did at the time of the film's release . But not just anyone could have played this character and made it work . Whether or not Stewart is acting the part well or is just being Jimmy Stewart in a well-matched role doesn't really matter , as the result is the same . He has a tremendous screen presence and carries the film , even though he's off-screen for much of it . "" Harvey "" is a sweet movie with a distinct strain of melancholia running through it . It's more about the way one wishes the world could be rather than the way it actually is .

The references to the more recent ones - "" Fatal Attraction "" , "" Basic Instinct "" , "" Sleeping with the Enemy "" , and "" Cape Fear "" ( 1991 ) are more likely to be recognized , but films like "" Double Indemnity "" and "" Body Heat "" take a ribbing as well . Veteran actor Armand Assante trades in his usual smoldering intensity for a Leslie Nielsen style deadpan comedy performance , and proves to be surprisingly adept . He plays Ned Ravine , who as a detective arrests criminals and then as a defense attorney gives them the best representation that money can buy . He is also so dense that he doesn't realize his unfaithful wife Lana ( Kate Nelligan ) intends to do him in . While this is happening a blonde femme fatale ( Sean Young ) is sinking her hooks into him . "" Fatal Instinct "" is a reasonably good film of its type - it has enough laughs to keep it watchable ; even if the quality and quantity of the jokes fails to measure up to material in say , the "" Naked Gun "" or "" Hot Shots !

Text2: An emotionally charged character study . Terry ( John Savage ) has been in prison for two years for a sex crime . He returns home to his doting mother Thelma ( screen legend Ann Sothern ) , but it's obvious his mind has taken a fateful turn for the worse . A sullen , withdrawn , and brooding individual , Terry develops an unhealthy fixation on Thelmas ' new tenant Lori ( Cindy Williams , a long way from ' Laverne & Shirley ' ) , while he himself becomes an object of interest for repressed neighbor Louise ( Luana Anders ) . More than just simple low-budget exploitation , this obscure film from Curtis Harrington sometimes succumbs to conventions of a revenge thriller as Terry strikes back at both the girl ( Sue Bernard ) whose testimony put him away as well as the lawyer ( Ruth Roman ) whom he feels failed him . However , it's the performances and the interactions of the characters that really sell this film . A sad , sordid air of melancholia permeates this film ; it got under my skin and stayed there . An unnatural relationship between mother and son is nothing new to film , but it takes on a real potency here . The film is also full of such striking and disturbing scenes as Thelma photographing Terry in the shower , Terry demonstrating to elderly tenant Ms . Orland how a mouse trap works , Terrys ' truly creepy dream of lying in a crib on the beach and being doted on as if he truly were still an infant . Sothern and Savage deliver exceptional , memorable performances , with Williams , Anders , and Roman fine in support . This picture really needs to be better known .

Gacy was truly a hated individual who nobody missed now or ever . Dennehy deserves an Emmy for his portrayal because he tries to bring a heart to a heartless villain of a character .

468,"Text1: Mosquitos and mascara , and a phony John O'Hara ' Yellow Jack ' is a goodish , proficiently made Hollywood drama which is weakened by several poor artistic decisions , and rendered absolutely ludicrous by one especially bad decision ( which I'll describe presently ) . The film deals with an inspiring true story in medical history , namely the attempts of the U . S . Army Medical Corps to find a cure for malaria , also known as yellow fever and ' yellow jack ' . This disease , spread by mosquitos , was so virulent in tropical regions that it seriously hampered the efforts to build the Panama Canal , as well as similar endeavours in Cuba and elsewhere . I'm only slightly familiar with the facts of this story , so I can't say how accurate this movie is . However , some of the actors in this cast are playing actual historic figures . . . notably the underrated Jonathan Hale as Major-General Leonard Wood , the officer in charge of the U . S . Army Yellow Fever Commission . Also excellent here is MGM stalwart Lewis Stone as Major Walter Reed , and Frank Puglia ( whom I usually dislike ) as Aristides Agramonte . Less impressive is Henry Hull , trying hard to be a serious "" ack-torr "" instead of portraying a believable character . Hull is cast as Jesse William Lazear , a physician who - - in real life - - deliberately infected himself by allowing ' loaded ' mosquitos to transmit the malaria virus to him . Hull's performance makes Lazear look ridiculous rather than heroic . The film takes place in Cuba in 1900 , hard upon the Spanish-American War . Dr Wood and his staff have found a potential treatment for malaria , but must test it on human subjects . Although one might expect Dr Wood to be the central character in this medical drama , the screenplay oddly emphasises one of his test subjects . ( This is one of the bad decisions which I've mentioned , but not the worst of them . ) Five medical volunteers are found ; the de-facto leader of these is played by Robert Montgomery , as an Irish-American trooper named John O'Hara . Is Montgomery playing an actual historic personage ? If not , it seems a strange decision for his character to be named John O'Hara , as this is the name of a best-selling novelist who was already well-known in 1938 . There are the usual Hollywood monkeyshines with history , notably in the casting of Virginia Bruce as an army nurse . An extremely beautiful blonde with great sex appeal but very little acting ability , Virginia Bruce is usually someone I'm delighted to see on the screen . Here , however , I find her beauty distracting . I can't believe that any woman as glammed-up as this would have been working as an army nurse in 1900 . During Louis B Mayer's reign as head of MGM , the studio had a firm policy that no leading lady would be depicted in an unglamorous manner . So , we get nonsense like this with army nurses getting the glamour treatment . No matter how steamy the swamps of Cuba might get , Virginia Bruce's mascara never wilts . She has a couple of very beautiful close-ups here . . . but that beauty works against the plausibility of this story . One of Montgomery's fellow guinea pigs , played by Buddy Ebsen , is a feller named Jelly Beans . I found this nickname hugely implausible . Did jelly beans even exist in 1900 ? Even if they did , ' Yellow Jack ' takes place largely in a military compound under military discipline : surely Ebsen's character would be referred to by his name or his rank , not some twee nickname . Ebsen was a talented character actor , but here he's been given a badly-written aw-shucks role , and he just can't make the character credible . The supremely bad decision was made by whoever decided that Montgomery should play his role with an Irish accent . Did I say Irish ? I meant ' Oirish ' . Montgomery's begorrah brogue is so full of Killarney blarney that it damages any plausibility in his characterisation , as well as the performances of other cast members in his scenes . Here we have a true story that ought to be dramatic and gripping on its own merits , yet Montgomery and Ebsen - - and , to a lesser extent , Henry Hull and Andy Devine - - are walking about with big red neon signs over their heads ,

The color was magnificent , too . The best part of the film , however , is the clever comedy woven throughout .

Text2: Death looms . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . ' Loom ' is a weird little movie . All the characters are stop-motion mannequins - - with some cheating at the beginning and the end - - but there's more weirdness here than there needs to be . Two of the mannequins have blue skin , versus the semi-realistic flesh tones of the others , but there doesn't seem to be any specific link between the two blue characters . One of the mannequins , a busker , has a square goatee which is apparently meant to signify that he's a hipster . A flesh-and-blood man with such an unnaturally-shaped beard would look disorienting but still real . Here , the oddly-shaped beard adds to the unreality of a character who already looks only vaguely realistic . The opening shot is a close-up of a real loom in the process of weaving a piece of cloth : entirely realistic , and therefore not preparing us for the unrealities to come . Then we see the weaver ; a bizarre blue-faced crone . Someone enters and gives her a pair of shears . With great effort , the crone steps outside . A 1950s-style American car , with rocket tailfins , zips past . In the street , a busker is playing a bass viol : an odd instrument for a street musician . A man and a little girl approach . In realistic interaction without dialogue , the little girl indicates to her companion ( her father ? ) that she wants some money to give to the busker . One of her coins rolls away ; she steps into the street to retrieve it , unaware of an approaching coach . The busker dives into its path , saving the girl's life but ending his own . We next see the injured busker lying on the pavement , in agony . The little girl and her father have apparently scarpered , even though this man just saved her life : that's gratitude for you ! Now the crone takes out a bobbin , which hangs suspended in air , slowly revolving round its longest axis above the busker's head . A long thread extrudes from the dying man's forehead , levitating skyward like the Indian Rope Trick , and is slowly wound onto the bobbin . When the crone takes out her shears and snips off the thread , the man dies . . . peacefully resting at last . The crone takes his thread back to her loom , and adds it to her tapestry . It's obvious that this crone represents one or more of the three ancient Fates : Clothos , Lachesis and Atropos . I was impressed by the bookend device which film-maker Scott Kravitz used in order to bring us into and out of his fantasy realm . All of the characters are stop-action mannequins . . . but at the very beginning and ending , the crone is played by an actress ( actor ? ) filmed in real time , wearing soft-sculpture mitts on both hands and a mask over her face . This makes the loom sequences easier and less expensive to film than the stop-action sequences ; it also has the effect of beginning and ending the movie with a comparatively realistic image . I'll rate ' Loom ' , and I look forward to seeing more work by Scott Kravitz .

That's no way to treat Bertrand Tavernier but compared to Claude Lelouch he probably feels he's being feted ; Lelouch's latest , The Human Condition : Part One , Parisiens , has been yanked already after just four weeks , I got there just in time but that's another story . It's amazing what Tavernier has been able to do with a very basic story of a French couple - Jacques Gamblin and Isabelle Carre - attempting to adopt a baby girl in Cambodia . Okay , location shooting helps but frankly Cambodia's not THAT interesting or photogenic whichever way you slice it and it's very much the central performances that sell this one . There's solid support from a few other couples in the same boat but Gamblin are Carre are light years ahead of the pack . Both , of course , have been around a while and both have copped awards , Carre , a Best Actress Cesar for Se Souvenirs des belles choses ( another outstanding film that was let down by the public ) and Gamblin in Tavernier's own recent masterpiece Laissez-Passer , but somehow they've never received the recognition they deserve and it may be that they'll be denied this time around too . For a cynical Westerner like me it's all too easy to believe in the political / governmental corruption that obtains in countries like Cambodia and Tavernier does little to disabuse me , telling it , presumably , like it is . And that's all it is , really , hope seguing to frustration , more hope , more bribes until at last . . . but go and see it , it's worth it , believe me .

471,"Text1: Fairly entertaining haunted house horror film . Lauren Cochran ( Robin Groves ) is a writer who lives in New York City and lately has been suffering from anxiety attacks , which her Doctor , Webb ( Patrick Farrelly ) put down to a condition called agoraphobia , which is a fear of leaving the house . Lauren decides to escape Manhattan and head to a small town called Dover Falls to finish her current novel . Her friend Mark Felton ( Christopher Loomis ) drives her to Dover Falls . They stop by the side of the road , take a break and stretch their legs . Lauren comes across an unusual large octagonal house that she feels she knows . It's exactly the same house she wrote about in one of her previous books entitled ' The Nesting ' . And that the cover illustration on the book that she described for the artist to draw is precisely the same as this house she is looking at now , even though she has never been there before . She immediately decides to rent the property . She makes arrangements with the house's owner , a Colonel Lebrun ( John Carradine ) and his grandson Daniel Griffith ( Micheal David Lally ) and moves in straight away . That night Lauren has a dream about the house , or was it a hallucination or possibly even ghosts ? While visiting , Dr . Webb has an ' accident ' and is killed . The local handyman Frank Beasley ( Bill Rowley ) is mysteriously drowned after trying to attack Lauren . More strange things happen , record players start on their own , words are mysteriously typed onto her work and Lauren continues to see strange people who seem able to just appear and disappear at will . She decides to investigate the house's history , and talks with a local farmer called Abner Welles ( David Tabor ) who becomes violent towards her when questioned about the house . Lauren becomes more and more unsure if what she has experienced is real , hallucinatory or if indeed there are ghosts inhabiting the house . Co-written and directed by Armand Weston I thought this was a decent enough haunted house horror film . The script by Weston and Daria Price takes quite a long time to establish the situation and is fairly slow going at times . But I have to say it kept me pretty interested and watching right through to the end . One thing that disappointed me was the lacklustre ending , after all the build-up I was hoping for something a little more substantial than what was offered , it just ends up being a bit of a let down and rather pedestrian . Robin Groves was good in the leading role , but I thought Micheal David Lally was awful . There's not much gore in it , just a scythe whacked into someones face , someone is impaled and some gunshot wounds at the end . There's a bit of nudity , but not much . The film looks OK and has a decent atmosphere to it , and the octagonal house is both unusual and cool , I don't think I've ever seen another house like it . If you don't mind a horror film with a slightly slow pace then you could do a lot worse than this , but then I suppose you could probably do a lot better as well . Worth watching , if you can find a cheap copy or catch it on T . V . for free .


Text2: Boring nonsense . Dead Birds starts in the small American town of Fairhope Alabama during the year 1863 where a gang hold up the local bank , they kill a few people & steal lots of gold . As they make their escape the plan is to stay at an old farm house before moving onto Mexico , simple yet effective I'm sure you'll agree . However not everything goes according to plan & it turns out that the guy who owned the farm house a few years back was some sort of Satan worshipper , bummer eh ? It's not long before everyone starts seeing ghosts & such things . . . Directed by Alex Turner I have to say I was very unimpressed with Dead Birds so it comes as a shock that it seems to have so many positive comments written about it . The script which feels like a lame cross between Ravenous ( 1999 ) & From Dusk Till dawn ( 1996 ) by co-producer Simon Barrett takes itself very seriously & is slow , very slow & I must admit that I lose interest very quickly in slow , boring , dull & predictable films such as Dead Birds . You can easily guess what's going to happen , you know the scenario where a group of people become stuck in an isolated located through certain circumstances , they all begin to wander off on their own & get killed one-by-one . To be honest Dead Birds isn't even a decent haunted house supernatural horror , there are too many vague elements to it , the climax where everything is supposedly revealed is weak & less than shocking & the twist end made no sense to me at all . I was not impressed with any aspect of Dead Birds including that awful title which has absolutely nothing to do with the film itself as far as I could tell . Director Turner does an OK job but there's nothing spectacular on show here , the period setting is reasonably well realised but it all felt a bit sparse & low budget , just putting a candle in a room doesn't mean it looks like it belongs in the 17th century does it ? Overall the film was very unsatisfying to me , the story could have been tighter & better fleshed out & it's extremely slow . There's an OK atmosphere but I'd say it was low on scares & also lacking in decent gore . There's a bit of blood including a blown off head at the start during the robbery but afterwards it's pretty dry apart from a decapitation , some chopped up horses & something bursting out a woman's stomach . Obviously shot on a low budget Dead Birds is well made but it's hardly going to knock any houses down . The acting was alright , to be honest I can't remember anyone from it or their performances & I only saw it a few hours ago . Dead Birds is a boring , predictable & not very good low budget horror film . Amazingly it seems to have fans out there so I guess it's doing something right although to be honest I sure as hell couldn't see it . Not recommended , by me anyway .

Too bad there wasn't much of him here to make this venture worth my time . But he did play his usual smooth and funny character . The beginning of this movie was funny , but it went down hill after about 30 minutes . Once they got rich , it just seemed there was nothing left . Tracey Ullman was good , but I just couldn't wait for this thing to end . I am not convinced that a die-hard Woody Allen fan would enjoy it .


Text2: With God's help I'll conquer this terrible affliction . The last time I remember seeing someone going through withdrawal was Frank Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm : "" You mean just stop ? Cold turkey ? You don't understand ! The pain . . . "" Renton ( Ewan McGregor ) was a little more expressive : "" I don't feel the sickness yet , but it's in the post . That's for sure . I'm in the junkie limbo at the moment . Too ill to sleep . Too tired to stay awake , but the sickness is on its way . Sweat , chills , nausea . Pain and craving . A need like nothing else I've ever known will soon take hold of me . It's on its way . "" The truth about drugs and the awful toll it take is clearly shown here . The most awful moment come after the baby dies and the mother is quick to "" relieve her pain .

This film is funny at times , but certainly there was no glamor . It was just some sick people with their lives going in circles . John Hodge's screenplay was magnificent . Danny Boyle's ( Shallow Grave , 28 Days Later . . . ) direction was super . Along with McGregor , the performances of Robert Carlyle ( The Full Monty , Human Trafficking ) and Kelly Macdonald ( What's her connection to Sinatra ? ) were impressive .

473,"Text1: truly frightening This is the true story of Sante Kimes and her son , Kenny Kimes , focusing specifically on their murder of wealthy New Yorker Irene Silverman , whose body has never been found . I have seen other material done on this nut job team , and it is a fascinating study of complete psychopaths . Mary Tyler Moore is a wonderful actress , and she portrays Sante in a very over the top manner - much the way the real Sante probably is , I would imagine , to have charmed people ( men especially ) and pulled off the scams she did . She is , however , way too old for the part , only because she has to portray Sante as a younger woman . Sante at the time of the Silverman murder was 64 ; Mary Tyler Moore in this film was 67 , so big deal . The problem comes in with the earlier years . Other than that , I thought the performances were excellent from the three stars . Though Kimes & son were eventually captured for Silverman's murder , their saga did not end there . Once in prison , Kenny held a Court TV reporter hostage for several hours by holding a ballpoint pen to her throat . He wound up in permanent solitary confinement . Mother and son were extradited to Los Angeles for trial on another , older murder , and both were ultimately convicted .


Text2: One of the great comedy classics Brilliantly brought from screen to stage , "" Arsenic and Old Lace "" is as funny today as it was 60 years ago . Newlywed Mortimer Brewster receives the worst of all wedding gifts - he finds out everyone in his family is completely nuts . He knew about his murdering brother Jonathan , who disappeared , and his uncle who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt . But it's not until he finds a body in his aunts ' window seat that he learns that his elderly aunts have been poisoning old men and burying them in the cellar . Josephine Hull and Jean Adair , who performed the aunts on Broadway , are perfection . Cary Grant's Mortimeris a masterpiece . His reactions to his situation are astonishing . For me it is one of his great performances . Raymond Massey as the returning Jonathan , who now looks like Boris Karloff since his plastic surgery , is hilariously menacing , and Peter Lorre , as the surgeon Dr . Einstein , is a perfect foil for him . He does a lot with his gestures - he's a riot . The cast is rounded out by Priscilla Lane , James Gleason , Edward Everett Horton , and Jack Carson , all of whom are marvelous in their roles . Capra brings it all together in a fast-moving film where there is always something going on . This is a hilarious movie . During the introduction on TCM , Peter Bogdanovich mentioned that Boris Karloff could not play the role of Jonathan , which he did on Broadway , because he was actually performing on Broadway at the time . I thought I had read elsewhere that he was actually very upset that he wasn't cast in the role of a man who looks like Boris Karloff . It would have been great to see him . Nevertheless , this film is a true treasure .

474,"Text1: If nothing else , it's interesting from a historical perspective Mario Bava is generally credited with creating the Giallo with his 1963 movies The Girl Who Knew Too Much and Blood and Black Lace . While a few more examples were made in the 1960s , the Giallo really took-off after Dario Argento released The Bird with the Crystal Plumage in 1970 . I mention these two dates because I think they're important when discussing 1968's The Young , the Evil & the Savage because they point how early in the Giallo cycle it falls . Yet , strangely enough , the movie feels rater tired . It's difficult for me to explain why , but I'll give it a try . Part of the problem is that even though The Young , the Evil & the Savage is an early Giallo , it's actually rather unoriginal . There's very little new ground broken in the movie . It plays like a cross between the previously mentioned Blood and Black Lace and the 1962 film Werewolf in a Girls ' Dormitory . Replace the werewolf with a mad killer and copy some of Bava's murder scenes and you've got The Young , the Evil & the Savage . Another factor that makes The Young , the Evil & the Savage feel tired is its rather staid , conservative look especially when compared with other films of the same period . There's really no comparison between this film and Lucio Fulci's One on Top of the Other made just a year later . Fulci's film has that hip , colorful , groovy feel to it that is definitely a product of the swinging 60s . To this day , it maintains its fresh and interesting look . The Young , the Evil & the Savage , on the other hand , has a feel and look to it of something much older . Visually , it has more in common with the previously mentioned 1962 film Werewolf in a Girl's Dormitory than it does something from 1968 . There are , however , a couple of reasons to see this movie . First , if you're a Giallo fan , the novelty of seeing such an early example should not be bypassed . From a historical perspective , it's an interesting film . Second , the final twist where the killer is revealed is quite well done and is easily the highlight of the movie . I'm seen a number of Gialli with underwhelming finales , so it was nice to see one where the ending was not only a winner , but the best thing about the movie . Edit : I just watched Dark Sky's new transfer of The Young , the Evil , and the Savage ( or Naked You Die ) . Gotta say it was like watching a different movie . There's nothing like have a nice looking transfer with good sound and cuts restored to make you change your mind about a movie . It's still not the best Giallo I've ever seen , but my opinion has improved . Dark Sky's transfer gave the movie some of that funkiness I thought it so desperately needed . Things like the mod / matching clothes to the groovy title song really stood out . I'm definitely glad I gave it another chance .


Text2: Beyond Evil Newly married couple , Larry and Barbara Andrews ( John Saxon & Lynda Day George ) move to a reputedly haunted mansion , Casa Fortuna , which yields a vengeful witch's spirit with strong powers . Poor Barbara's body and soul are slowly taken over by the spirit , Alma Martin ( Janice Lynde , under various wigs ) , and those Larry works with during the construction of a major hotel , such as pal Del Giorgio ( Michael Dante ) and Dr . Frank Albanos ( Mario Milano ) both men with a lot riding on the job and it's business potential , are in danger of her wrath . A worried Larry , whose own life is threatened when a crane , operated by Alma's spirit , carrying heavy material used for construction which nearly falls on top of him ( . . killing a co-worker by him ) , will seek help from a faith healer Doctor Solomon ( David Opatoshu ) . But , as Alma slowly gains control of Barbara her powers emerge , such as green laser blasts from the eyes , superhuman abilities to lift and throw men in the air , pulling a car apart before exploding it down a cliff , etc . Larry and Solomon will have to work together to somehow stop Alma from totally taking control . From the director of "" Graduation Day "" ( . . another Troma release ) , Herb Freed tries his hand in the demonic thriller genre . I think the cast gives it their best shot , but the budget is just too small and so many scenes show signs of post production tinkering where one scene doesn't transition smoothly to the next and the special effects ( . . particularly when Alma uses her powers , with green tint often appearing like a halo around Day George's head before she blasts somebody ) are rather cheap . I think one often needs an appropriate budget when approaching a film about demonic possession and a lot of the special effects undermine a decent effort from the director . I must also admit that there are some lighting issues , with a lot of scenes so dark you could barely see the actors , especially at night . I'm certainly not against low-budget film-making , and I think setting your film on an island inside a mansion which carries a certain flavor of it's surroundings certainly helps . I think the leads are fine . Saxon is the concerned husband , often playing him as conflicted and confused . Day George shows the battle of personalities raging inside , the sweet innocent Babs , and the evil Alma starting to take over . Lynde as Alma is actually pretty creepy with how she widens her mad eyes , opening her fingers exposing those long nails as she shoots green light . I think if Herb just had some more money , and decidedly remained away from using special effects concerning colors , he'd had a better film . But , it's assured that people will watch this with uncontrollable laughter , certainly at the special effects and perhaps hold a feeling of embarrassment for Saxon and Day George who deserve a better film . There are some make-up effects concerning Solomon's faith healing rituals where he slices open the stomach of "" patients "" removing the problems plaguing them ( . . one case goes wrong , to a child no less , when Alma interferes ) that work well .

475,"Text1: Dawn of the Dead rip-off extrodinare . What to say about this movie ? Where to start ? I think I will begin with the title . I bought it as "" Hell of the Living Dead "" . It is also known as "" Virus "" , "" Night of the Zombie "" , and "" Zombie : Creeping Flesh "" . Out of these titles the creeping flesh one and virus fit , but the other two do not . Especially , the night one . Most of the zombie action takes place in broad daylight . Then there is the stock footage . I know many have commented on it , but man there is a lot of it . Here is a little advice to all film makers , don't set the movie in a location you can't film in . And if you must use stock footage at least use some different shots rather than just birds and monkeys in the tree tops . Then there is the music . When people say it is just like "" Dawn of the Dead "" they aren't kidding . It is exactly the same music and when it isn't music from Dawn it is music from a sci-fi movie called "" Alien Containamation "" and when it isn't music from it , it is a combination of both . Then there is the similarities between Dawn and this movie . The swat team , the reporters , the center at the end and the mall in dawn , the situation at the beginning where the swat team is first introduced , the elevator scene and so on . The zombies themselves aren't the best in the game . Well some do look rather good , but most of them have very little make up . Then there is the swat team who make it through horde after horde of zombie only losing one member , this team seems competent , then they reach the facilty and proceed to become very easily killed idiots . They aren't very distinct either , I think they are all dubbed by the same person . A good point about this movie is the plot . It involves a leak a research facility called "" Hope "" . Its nice to have zombies come to life for a reason and as bad as this flick is the end isn't to bad with plenty of gore effects . In fact after the "" Hope "" scene the movie cuts to two people attacked in the park and it is like wow this is looks like a better zombie movie about to start ! But it is actually the end of this one . You can learn some lessons from this movie though 1 ) Zombies can only be killed if you shoot them in the head , but go ahead and shoot them in the body because it looks cool and you never run out of ammunition anyway 2 ) When going into an area of stock footage natives get the girl in your party to take her shirt off and dress up like a native , does it help , no ! But if she's willing to do it let her ( why didn't the horny soldiers not make one comment when she took off her shirt ? ) 3 ) If your friend is attacked by an apparently dead rat , don't lend a hand he deserves to die for being stupid enough to let himself get killed by a rat 4 ) Don't put your guns down and put on a tu-tu and top hat and pick up a cane when zombies are in the area 5 ) When on a beach it is possible to find boats just lying around 6 ) and finally , don't speculate on why everything is happening till you are out of the building where the zombies are , this just gives them a chance to gang up on you . In the end this is a bad flick with some areas that are OK . If you have a wicked sense of humor though and like making fun of films then give it a try .


Text2: No taming of the shrew here ! "" The Killer Shrews "" is another very poor and overly silly creature-feature from the 50's , and yet you can never bring yourself to hate this kind of movies entirely , simply because they have so much charm and spontaneity . Sure , every possible aspect looks incompetent as hell but simultaneously it's so damn entertaining that the playtime of only 70 minutes will be over before you know it . For a while , it even actually seems like the film won't be bad at all ? The opening sequences are efficiently mysterious and mood setting and you don't really know what to expect until the main character himself ( James Best ) learns about the horror of the "" shrews "" . He stars as the captain of a supply-boat that arrives at a small island where scientists experiment with rodents . This naturally went miserably wrong and the humongous rat-creatures eat their way through the island . With a healthy dose of ingeniousness and grotesque ideas , the last survivors attempt to flee to the sea . As you've probably read already in other reviews , the shrews are ordinary dogs camouflaged with head-stuffing and fake teeth . They really don't evoke feelings of fear but still I thought it was fairly well done , especially considering the budget Ray Kellog ( who's a special effects artist himself ) disposed of . The dialogues are fluently written and I didn't have any problems with the wooden acting . The intrigues between the characters ( especially the hero versus the sneaky assistant-scientist ) are probably the best elements of the whole movie .

"" The Second Civil War "" is a great underrated satire of politics and war and "" Toy Soldiers "" isn't given much credit , but I liked it for what it was . But sometimes Dante stumbles . "" The Howling , "" in 1981 , was a cash-in on the success of John Landis ' "" An American Werewolf in London "" - - and it's distinctly familiar in its camp humor , human transformations , and even directorial style . This was before Dante had carved a name for himself and it really does just seem like he's copying Landis . "" . . . Werewolf in London "" isn't a great movie but compared to this it does look a great deal better .

Text2: One Of The Better Westerns Of That Era I was very impressed with this film . I would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns . I say that for the whole thing : the acting , mature dialog , no - nonsense story and excellent cinematography . Director Anthony Mann , who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era , also made some westerns such as this one . It has that same film-noir look .

First intended for Raimu , it seems that Vanel was finally a better choice and anyway if you give this movie a chance , he's gonna blow your mind . Lord ! What an actor ! MOnsieur Lechat is a nouveau riche : he epitomizes the American dream turned French . A self made man , he worked his way up and now he lives in luxury in a desirable mansion where his missus ( who tells her daughter that if there are poor people it's because they are lazy ) is ill-at-ease ( it's so huge , I cannot get used to it ) .

He feels no remorse when he learns a man committed suicide whereas he could have saved him effortlessly . "" Business is business "" is Octave Mirbeau's play masterfully transferred to the screen . Monsieur Lechat makes all Chabrol's bourgeois seem nice by comparison . Monsieur Lechat ' s next victim is to be the Marquis de Porcellet ( Marquis of Piglet ) . Now the bourgeois have replaced the nobles at the top , and there is no room there for the ruined aristocrats except . . . if they let their son marries the wealthy businessman's daughter . For , like Monsieur Jourdain , in Moli√®re ' s "" Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme "" , Monsieur Lechat wants his daughter to be a Marquise ( and maybe a duchess ) . Unlike Jourdain , Lechat is no idiot and he kills two birds with one stone : he enters an obsolete world which retained in the first half of the twentieth century some prestige ; and he humiliates a man whose pride , honor , duty and moral values are his reasons to live . But if Mirbeau shows some sympathy for the Marquis ( and finally avenges him ) , he does believe that all those values are doomed and fast becoming things of bygone days . "" Les Affaires Sont les Affaires "" , released in the darkest year of the Occupation is almost a desperate work : only the tycoon's daughter , by breaking off communication with her family , may mean hope for the future .

It's a teeny cyber-thriller that stars not one , but two Japanese teen pop groups , Speed and Da Pump , both of which get a song .

Text2: Excellent family entertainment - - and thank goodness it doesn't stray too far from the source material . Okay , many of you are about to become offended , but I've gotta say it . The movie version of "" How the Grinch Stole Christmas "" ( THE GRINCH ) was a horrible movie in practically every way . The worst problem with it is that the entire moral lesson of the original story is lost and in fact the movie states the exact opposite of what the author intended ! ! In the book and Chuck Jones special , the Whos were nice folks that didn't need all the presents as they were sincere in their reverence for the holidays . In the Jim Carey remake , the Whos were all selfish and materialistic ! ! What a horrible way to ruin Dr . Seuss ' vision ! It's like translating the Bible and making Satan the good guy ! In light of how far THE GRINCH strayed , I especially loved HORTON HEARS A WHO because it didn't wander far from the source material or convolute the moral of the story . Sure , the story was changed a bit and several subplots were added , but I could accept this - - after all , they had about 88 minutes to fill and there had to be SOME padding . However , the original story can still easily be distinguished and perhaps after this film , Seuss can finally stop spinning in his grave ! ! So , apart from the faithfulness to the original story , what did I like ? Well , I was once again thrilled to see Fox making CGI films . Their ICE AGE films were pretty good and HORTON is even prettier and more entertaining . Quality-wise , this is about on-par with a Pixar or Dreamworks production . I particularly loved Whoville - - as with powerful computers , they were able to animate hundreds , if not thousands , of wonderful Whos . And it was cute all the little tiny touches - - so much so that the film holds up well to repeated viewing in order to catch all the action and details . Plus the town looked very Seuss-ian - - like the pages of the books come to life . It was a real joy to watch . Was there anything I didn't like ? Well , the song at the end by REO Speedwagon was simply terrible way to wrap up the film . It was schmaltzy and pointless and looked as if the producers were stuck finding a decent way to tie everything together . However , considering this is my only gripe , then this is still a heck of a film - - one the kids AND parents can enjoy . Kids will love it and parents will actually not be bored - - a rare achievement in a film .

The two of them manage a few real Harry Langdon moments , when the pixilated Harry - - actually , here he seems permanently soused - - is befuddled by the modern world , in the form of a telephone hooked up to the electricity line and the toaster on the telephone jack . If you are a fan of Harry Langdon's style of comedy - - and I am - - then you will enjoy this movie for those moments . And therefore you will hate it for its loud , cheap , painful Jules White setting of random violence and Elsie Ames - - a talented contortionist who worked well with Buster Keaton in a couple of his Columbia shorts , because she could take a fall very well , but here she's just annoying . So should you see this ? If you're a Harry Langdon fanatic , yes , for those few brief moments . But otherwise , no .

"" Journey Into Fear "" plays like second-rate Graham Greene , with Cotten playing an American munitions dealer who finds himself the target of an assassination attempt by a group of Nazis . Much of the picture takes place on a seedy steamer intended to carry Cotten to safety . The film's got some nice touches , and there's a pretty exciting shoot-out finale that's something right out of Hitchcock , but the overall package isn't that memorable . Welles has a supporting role as a Turkish police chief and Welles regular Agnes Moorehead appears as a grumpy French woman .

Text2: music to anyone's ears Like "" The Commitments "" and "" O Brother , Where Art Thou ? "" , "" Songcatcher "" focuses on music in a way that you shouldn't miss . It tells the story of musicologist Lily Penleric ( Janet McTeer ) who travels to an isolated village in the Appalachians and gets to hear the music of the Scottish-Irish people there in the early 20th century . Can this really be the whole plot of a movie ? When the movie has such great music , it definitely can . Because what Lily hears does many things : aside from just being great music , it shows how the people in this village may not be educated or anything like that - and could even be inbred - but they still have their culture . I definitely recommend this movie . Also starring Aidan Quinn ( happy birthday , Aidan ! ) and Emmy Rossum a few years before she played Sean Penn's daughter in "" Mystic River "" .

Coppola made a visually stunning film that focus on the old days in the famous Harlem night club that was the place where a lot of black stars got their start in show business . The film concentrates in the mobsters that were running all the rackets in Harlem , rather than in what was going on at the club . The setting is just a pretext for the story . By concentrating in the white gangsters , the story suffers . It's only when the action switches to the black performers working at the Cotton Club that some life comes into the screen . The film , as a canvas , is interesting to see , but some of the vignettes don't work . The Dixie Dwyer of Richard Gere doesn't go anywhere . Mr . Gere is a bland presence amid all the violence around him . Nicolas Cage's Vincent Dwyer seems like an after thought . On the other hand , the great Gregory Hines and Lonette McKee shine as a pair of black performers that find themselves in love .

486,"Text1: Could've been better , could've been a lot worse George Romero , with his films and choosing of certain projects , is at least dependably unpredictable . The genres he works in 99 % of the time are in the horror genre , or some bird of it ( be it with zombies in his ' Dead ' films , or more psychological with Martin and the Dark Half ) . Here he brings us the tale of a once prime athlete confined to a wheelchair , and the plucky little monkey who is trained to help him around the house and act as his companion as well as hands and feet . But , of course , things don't turn out right with what this ' experiment ' comes forth . It's like one of those stories you find in those cheap paperback books at the grocery store , only stripped down to bare essentials and given some adrenaline from its filmmaker . This is a peculiar film to see , which offers brilliance as well as dullness and just plain oddness . Some things about the story make less sense than others as well ( as will happen when science becomes important to the story as opposed to more of a MacGuffin ) . The lead actor , Jason Beghe , is good in the role , but isn't nearly as convincing in being the after effect of the ' medicine ' he's given ( as does the Monkey ) as he is in being the earnest , nice side of the character . There is even one great supporting performance in cold , hard-pressed form from Christine Forrest ( wife and bit player in the films of Romero ) . It's not meant to be taken very seriously , to be sure , but Romero on the one hand has a kind of sweet ( in the ironic sense ) , interesting story with just the monkey and her master , as the injections start to take its toll on the both of them . On the other hand , he still has to work in this framework of building up more and more terror with a kind of one-foot death-machine or something . It's worth a look , especially for just the craft of the film , but it's definitely not one of Romero's best .


Text2: one of the most beautifully photographed films of the 90s , though if amazing imagery isn't lacking , plot is I always wonder what it might be like to have a film set in a location that is explicitly specific , with this film , as example , the Sahara desert and outlining areas of North Africa , and to not have some kind of Lawrence of Arabia kind of epic story attached to it . It's a challenge for a filmmaker to attempt , and Bernardo Bertolucci did attempt it in 1990 with the Sheltering Sky , based on the book that seems to be massively popular ( though un-read by me ) . Whether he succeeded completely or not will depend on how much the viewer can take seeing characters sort of engulfed by the director and cinematographer's own adoration of the strange and bizarrely exotic locales . The story is boiled down , probably more-so than was in the Bowles novel , about a husband and wife ( Malkovich and Winger ) , and their friend ( Scott ) , who go to "" travel "" in North Africa . For what precisely is uncertain , but it is clear that the focal point is that of their marriage failing after years together ( both sides sleeping with others , distanced , not altogether honest in conversation ) . But this changes , of course , once Paul gets typhoid and has a fever for the middle chunk of the film . After this , when a change of events occur , The Sheltering Sky gets even more surreal and sensual then before , if still slightly obtuse in how to really relay a good story . And it's not that Bertolucci is whacked out , like with La Luna , as a storyteller per-say . He actually progresses what there is involving the characters pretty well , and Malkovich and Winger are up to the task of playing people who are sort of bourgeois malcontents who get their respective states of mind altered through their travels of the fly-ridden villages and poor towns in the Sahara region . But it seems like material , even for someone who hasn't read the book , to be more evocative as prose then as filmed , and the many customs and many little details of the villagers are left as more-so poetic aspirations than things relevant to the narrative . This all being said , The Sheltering Sky may possibly be Bertolucci's most astoundingly shot feature , with it coming right behind Goodfellas as the best cinematography of 1990 ( via the great Vittorio Storaro ) . Shot after shot looks like it could come out of a truly exquisite book , and the dedication to compositions and long shots and how a close-up can be just as meaningful cinematically as a view of the desert , is the best that Bertolucci has to offer . But then again , like with Antonioni when he's at his most scatter-shot , without characters who even subtly convey a lot , or with strong enough themes aside from the despair amid an alien environment ( to the characters ) , it becomes the textbook case of style over substance . I'd recommend it , especially to fans of the director and DP , but I can understand the dismay that fans of the book had at the adaptation , despite the convincing performances and ( as a given ) the wonder of seeing places not seen before , like the not-filmed-before-this-film location of Niger .

Charles Forbin ( a strong and charismatic performance by Eric Braeden ) creates Colossus , a powerful and super-intelligent computer that's devised to regulate America's defense systems . Colossus instead gets in touch with its equally potent Russian counterpart Guardian . The two computers plot to take over the world . It's up to Forbin and his crack team of scientists to concoct a way of stopping Colossus before it's too late . Joseph Sargent's able direction , working from a smart and provocative script by James Bridges , not only wrings plenty of tension from the arresting premise , but also relates said story in a taut , involving and above all convincing manner . The superb acting from a top-drawer cast constitutes as another substantial plus : Susan Clark as Forbin's loyal assistant , Gordon Pinsent as the amiable president of the United States , William Schallert as a CIA director , Dolph Sweet as an army colonel , and George Stanford Brown , Robert Cornthwaite and James Hong as computer experts . The late , great Paul Frees supplies the creepy , droning , tinny voice of Colossus . Gene Polito's sharp , agile cinematography , Michel Colombier's rousing , rattling score , Albert Whitlock's terrific special effects , and a chillingly downbeat ending are all up to speed as well . Back in the early 70's this film was quite ahead of its time .

It's the story of deranged psychotic Edward Gein , only in this film the story is a lot closer to how it actually happened than in any of the classics that it influenced . Deranged is a film not for the feint hearted . Shot on an extremely low budget of just two hundred thousand dollars , the directorial team of Jeff Gillen and Alan Ormsby have created one of the most vile and disgusting films that I've ever seen . Subtitled ' Confessions of a Necrophile ' for the US market , Deranged tells the story of Ezra Cobb ; a simple farm owner who lives with his domineering mother . After her death , Ezra gradually slips into insanity ; starting with the unearthing of his yearlong dead mother from the grave . Ezra then decides that she needs patching up , and so embarks on unearthing more bodies for the task . It isn't long , however , before the psychopath is on the rampage for fresher victims . . . Deranged goes all out to shock from the outset . The image of Ezra carrying his dead mother into her bedroom is sickening in a way that few movies manage . The amoral attitude of the character adds to this sickness , and ensures that most audience members will be uncomfortable watching this film . Deranged benefits from a superb lead performance courtesy of Roberts Blossom . Blossom does an amazing job of convincing us that he really is the psycho at the centre of the film . Usually in films like this , I am firmly on the side of the killer ; not really caring about the victims - but Blossom is so vile in this film that I was actually praying he DIDN'T catch his prey ! The film has a short running time , but this time is used excellently on a series of nasty and weird sequences , and the movie never really lets the pace go once it has set itself up . On the whole , this film has gained itself a cult following for a reason . It's certainly not for everyone's taste , and it's not as good as the most famous of the films that the story has influenced - but if you like your cinema to grisly and shocking ; Deranged is a film that you should seek out !


Text2: The fly returns , this time on a budget Obviously , this sequel is nowhere near as good as the original 1958 film ' The Fly ' , but despite obviously being a cheap follow-up and working from a story that basically just rips off the first film , there are some good ideas here and the film is definitely worth watching . The only actor to return from the original movie is Vincent Price , but the story does lead directly on as in true horror sequel style , in this film we follow the fortunes of the original scientist's son , who naturally decides to follow on his father's experiments . Price isn't the only thing that was recycled for this film , however , as the film was apparently written to incorporate sets from the original , although this does make sense considering how the story follows on . The hapless scientist this time is Philippe Delambre , son of Andre Delambre , and a man who has decided to rebuild the transportation device . Along with his friend Alan Hinds and uncle Francois Delambre , they conduct a series of experiments in the hope of succeeding where Andre failed . . . but naturally , as nothing runs smoothly in a horror film , events take a turn for the macabre . . . I'm guessing that black and white film was cheap around 1959 as despite the fact that the original film was shot in colour , this one is in black and white . However , I actually prefer films like this in black and white , so this wasn't a problem for me . Vincent Price took a backseat in the original film , but as his star was rising by the release of this follow-up ; he gets a more central role , although he still doesn't appear enough if you ask me . His role here isn't one of his strongest , but anything that features a performance from the great Mr Price is well worth seeing if you ask me . It has to be said that most of the performances ( and dialogue ) in this film are pretty ridiculous , but among the rest of the cast Brett Halsey , an actor who would go on to make Italian films along with this likes of Mario Bava and Lucio Fulci , stands out as the unlucky scientist . The film obviously isn't very graphic ; although it's slightly more violent than the first film , and the transporter machine is put to much better use here . The special effects are inventive too , and work well despite obviously not costing much . Overall , this is at least a worthy follow-up , which while not as great as the original ; has its moments and is worth seeing .

Unfortunately this sequel takes all the bad points of the original and modifies aspects of its own that make it a far lesser film One aspect is the whole feel of the movie . The original was produced as a straightforward road movie similar to THE GUMBALL RALLY whilst here we see post referential lines and parodies of other movies like THE GODFATHER and SOME LIKE IT HOT which makes it resemble something more akin to HOT SHOTS and Repossessed while still retaining bits that are almost identical to the first one . For instance did we really need another set piece battle involving Jackie Chan and a bunch of bikers ? CANNONBALL RUN 2 does have a very funny scene where a bogus nun whispers into Dean Martin's ear who gives a shocked expression . He turns to Sammy Davis Jnr and whispers what was said .

While this is a nice short and it looks very good visually in a number of spots , I can't muster the enthusiasm for it that it probably deserves , because I've seen the basic premise executed much more effectively in other shorts ( most notably in Porky's Road Race ) by Warner Brothers and by Fleischer Studios in a Betty Boop short , the title of which escapes me at the moment . So while there are some nice gags , like Bosko "" tuning "" his car with the aid of a piano and later on his changing of a flat by first using a cat as a make-shift jack , unzipping the tire and swapping out inner-tubes , too many of the gags are similar to other gags I've seen in other shorts , where they were more effectively done .

The women in town seem to have no interests other than cleaning their houses and pleasing their husbands . Is it something in the water ? Joanna and Bobbie must discover the mystery of Stepford before they become its next victims . While The Stepford Wives may be slow going , it never gets dull . The slow pace adds a lot to the mystery . I've often argued that for effective suspense , you can't rush it . It takes time to build . And even though I knew exactly where The Stepford Wives was going , it was a joy to watch the mystery unfold . Two of the biggest things the movie has going for it are the cast and the script . As for the cast , Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss are outstanding . Ross plays her role in a very understated manner and isn't quick to jump to wild conclusions without adequate proof . Too often , characters in horror movies will jump to the wildest of conclusions without a shred of evidence . It makes things very unrealistic . As for Prentiss , she steals every scene in which she appears . And her character is one of the most intelligent , yet free-spirited characters I've seen recently in a movie . In fact , given the implausibility inherent in the story , the entire script is written intelligently . The characters speak and act as one would expect given the circumstances .

Text2: Lee's best performance as Dracula ? In the past , I've accused Jess Franco of losing focus about 10 minutes into his films . It's not unusual to see him stray from his subject for a few unnecessary close-ups of any random object or to include several minutes of what appears to be vacation footage he shot out of the window of a car . That's certainly not the case with Franco's Count Dracula . By Franco's standards , it's a very straight forward story . There are a number of other things to like about the movie . Excusing the Spain for England locations , the sets are wonderfully Spartan and very atmospheric . Bruno Nicolai's score is about as good as you'll find in any of Franco's efforts . But the highlight is the acting . Franco assembled one of the most acclaimed casts he ever worked with . Klaus Kinski , Herbert Lom , and Christopher Lee give the film immediate credibility . Lee's performance is the real standout . Of the numerous times he played Dracula , his work in Count Dracula just might be the best of his career . The supporting players , featuring the usual group of Franco regulars , give some of their best performances . But it's this straight forward approach used by Franco that contributes to the films downfall . Franco was attempting to film a fairly faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel ( it was the only way he could get Lee to agree to play Dracula ) . And while he may have actually been more successful along that line than some of the other , better known Dracula films , unfortunately the end result is incredibly dull and lifeless . While the film gets off to a good start with Jonathan Harker's visit to Dracula's castle , things grind to a halt once Dracula reaches England . So even though Count Dracula may represent one of Franco's most competently directed films , the boredom factor is too high to rate the movie anything better than average .

He's in competition with Alan Dinehart who calls himself a "" geneologist "" and has just about the same set of ethics Cagney has . The only difference is Cagney lacks the polish of Dinehart and is less a hypocrite . Now no one ever confused James Cagney with Ronald Colman on the screen and I daresay they probably were never up for the same parts , but Cagney dumbs it down to Leo Gorcey levels in order to contrast himself with Dinehart . It's effective though . What makes this film special is that the leading lady is Bette Davis who was a year away from finally getting Jack Warner to give her a role with substance in Of Human Bondage . Speaking of class , you can see that Ms . Davis has it in abundance and that she wasn't going to be held down with supportive leading lady roles . Later on Cagney and Davis were given The Bride Came COD when both were big box office names . Cagney is quite the operator here and I won't tell you exactly what he does , he does bend our legal system over backwards though .

He even puts on a big cowboy outfit , but Olmstead laughs at him , saying he's just a Tom Mix wannabe . This was my first exposure to the comic talents of George K . Arthur whose career sputtered to a halt with the coming of sound . The role he plays here would be the kind that Joe E . Brown would do in the Thirties , Red Skelton might try in the Forties and after his split from Dino , Jerry Lewis might have a go in the Fifties at . There's rumor of bootlegging being done in the area and guess what , D'Algy's at the bottom of it . I think just about anyone else can figure out where the rest of this film is going . Former Mack Sennett employees Hank Mann as the soda jerk and Charles Murray as the grizzled old time western sidekick to Arthur are featured . Murray has a very nice turn as a man who just because Prohibition is in the land is not going to let that stand in the way of that old western tradition of the saloon . In fact I've often wondered what happened to the saloon in Prohibition times and The Boob does provide something of an answer . The film might have been forgotten today , but for the presence of Joan Crawford in a secondary role as a Treasury agent . In fact that's a feminist concept many years ahead of its time . What must Eliot Ness have thought of this film ? Crawford could have been given a lot more to do in this film . In her next film she would also be in support of a silent screen comic , Harry Langdon in Tramp Tramp Tramp . The Boob was pleasantly amusing enough and it was interesting to see Joan Crawford in her silent days , something I hadn't done until now .

492,"Text1: Justice in 90 minutes or your Pizza's free Gino Felino , like Nico Toscani , Mason Storm and John Hatcher before him , is a good cop in a bad mood . His partner Bobby Lupo has been gunned down in the streets in front of his wife and kids by crazed wannabe gangster Richie Madano . Richie was always into something bad , even when he was a kid and now seems to be going psycho , snorting coke and smoking crack . He's got a one-way ticket to oblivion and he's going to have fun getting there along with his evil henchmen Joey Dogs , Bobby Arms and Bochi . Luckily for the good citizens of Brooklyn , Gino is on the case and on the mission to find Richie by means of broken bones , severed limbs and agonizing pain . As Steven Seagal movies go ( the pre-1997 Golden Years ) Out For Justice is definitely one of the strongest . Tight fast-paced direction , well balanced widescreen framing , a great score by David Michael Frank and an impressive cast of familiar faces give it a lasting impression . Also , Seagal has mentioned that this is his favorite film of his own and you can really see it in his acting . He's often been criticised for not giving any effort and I wholeheartedly agree in regard to his later films . But there was a time when he did try and in Out For Justice you can see that a little effort goes a long way . I know his Brooklyn accent isn't THAT convincing and his acting in general isn't exactly on par with Olivier , but if he we're to be just as enthusiastic about his other characters then maybe his film career wouldn't be in the toilet . Out For Justice never loses its appeal . William Forsythe is just so evil as Richie that I've never been convinced by the nice guy characters he's played in other movies . The fight scenes in which Seagal takes measures to ensure maximum suffering are most entertaining and small moments of character give it a strange edge . But you can tell that there's been a lot of stuff left out . This is especially evident in the montage sequences where characters are wearing different clothing and meet up with each other all over the place . There is also hints at more murders by Richie in the trailer that are never seen or referenced in the film at all . Proof positive that Seagal once had it . But then came religion and then . . . well . . . you know how it went .


Text2: Beware ? a murderous pizza ! ! Man , I hate the ' House'-series ( and yet , I've seen all four of them ? go figure ! ) . This franchise never really could decide whether it wanted to bring horror ? or comedy . This fourth entry isn't an exception on that . For one thing , this film introduce us to a family dramatically torn apart by a terrible car-accident and for another , it adds absurd elements like bloodthirsty pizza's ( ! ) , dogs with lampshades attached to their head and comic-book style villains . What's the deal ? Are we supposed to be scared or bring out the beer and laugh ? The plot is dreadfully lame involves ghost-house , build on a spiritual Indian ground ? Oh , how original . Yet , if these were the only problems House 4 suffered from , it would still be more or less reasonable . The biggest letdown lies in the entirely illogical structure . I don't know if this ever occurred to cast and crew but ? their story doesn't make sense at all ! By the way ? SPOILERS will follow here , in case you care . At first , the ' spirits ' of the house seem to turn against Kelly and almost even force her to kill her daughter , while suddenly and for unexplained reasons , these exact same spirits start helping her in fighting the bad guys .

493,"Text1: MAGIC TOWN ( William A . Wellman , 1947 ) Written and produced by frequent Frank Capra collaborator Robert Riskin and starring the director's three-time leading man James Stewart , one would be excused for mistaking this for a film by the celebrated purveyor of socially-conscious comedies . However , while the plot is typically original and engaging , somehow it lacks Capra's unique cinematic expertise in putting over Riskin's ideas : the tone is too often syrupy and sentimental , while the hero isn't made to face formidable villains such as one finds in Capra's work . Even if director Wellman was more at home in outdoor actioners , he often displayed a social side and , for the record , had previously triumphed in two classic films set in contemporary times ? namely the original version of A STAR IS BORN and the screwball comedy NOTHING SACRED ( 1937 ) . Stewart is a poll expert who believes that one city in the U . S . could be deemed the reference point as to how the whole nation thinks and feels about all aspects of life ? its aspirations , trends , political views , etc . His report leads him to settle on the small Midwestern town of Grandview which , however , is on the point of modernizing itself ( via a project bequeathed to local reporter Jane Wyman by her father ) . This would , doubtless , affect the idealized image being promoted by Stewart of Grandview as the prototypical American town with its simple way of life , so he manipulates the populace ( without letting them on to his line of work ) into opposing Wyman's scheme ! This doesn't prevent the two from falling in love ? a romance which ends , though , when she overhears him speaking to his superior in New York ; distraught , she exposes his racket ? but , in so doing , brings a whole circus of ' prospectors ' and newshounds upon Grandview ? so that the next poll turns out to be a disaster , and the town is disgraced ! Stewart is dismayed by all of this ; however , he keeps in touch with the people of Grandview ( the kids especially had learned to look up to him in view of his basketball prowess ! ) and , of course , Wyman . Eventually , he hits upon the idea that a pompous statement made earlier ( but which remained unpublished ) by the highest authorities in Grandview that , if necessary , they'll erect the proposed civic centre with their own hands could be used now to symbolize the town's determination to re-emerge ? An RKO production , the film also features such reliable performers as Ned Sparks and Donald Meek as Stewart's associates , Kent Smith as a Grandview professor and ex-school chum of Stewart's , and Wallace Ford as one of the eminent townspeople .


Text2: Not many laughs In this short , Bugs tells the story of his life from the day he was born right up until his discovery in Hollywood and subsequent stardom . It isn't really funny as Bugs doesn't have anyone to work with for most of the cartoon . There are a couple of scenes with Elmer Fudd but he doesn't do or say much . And the running joke with the chorus dancers in the tuxedos wasn't all that amusing . I was also a bit annoyed at the end because not only is it not funny but it isn't true . I've seen better Bugs cartoons than this . Though I must say the title song is very cool ( used in many of ' Rabbit / Duck season ' cartoons with Bugs , Daffy and Elmer ) .

Text2: New Gun In Town Knowing of writer-director Richard Wilson's connection with Orson Welles I was curious to see if any of the maestro's magic had rubbed off but alas . . . What Wilson serves up is a rehash of Johnny Concho , a Sinatra vehicle from 1957 . In that movie Sinatra , by virtue of his gunman brother , ' ruled ' the town until William Conrad showed up having outgunned Sinatra's brother and the town is stuck with another gunman . Wilson's twist is to have citizen Pat Hingle send for gunfighter Yul Brynner to take care of George Segal ; Brynner opts to spare Segal and Hingle and the townsfolk live to regret sending for Brynner . There are reasonable performances but definitely no Wellesian touches and in the end it is just another ho hum Western .

496,"Text1: And a Wayans brother has blown yet another movie . The original Ladykillers is one of those rare comedy classics that's not really funny anymore , like The Odd Couple . But it is smartly made and it respects itself and its audience . It's a dark comedy but it's a smart one , it has colorful characters who move through the movie in pursuit of questionable goals and suffer through lots of hilarious mishaps along the way . Sure , they're not funny , but you have to appreciate the situational humor involved . Like the original film , the 2004 remake focuses on a strange ensemble of characters each in it for the money , no one knows anyone else outside the group , and the leader thinks he has everything planned out to the most minute detail until everything that can possibly go wrong goes wrong at every turn . I remember when The Ladykillers came out in theaters , where I never had the chance to see it , and I remember being genuinely surprised to see that the Dawn of the Dead remake was getting better reviews than this , the latest Tom Hanks movie . I just don't associate Tom Hanks with movies that get lesser acclaim than remakes of 80s horror films . Then I saw the Dawn of the Dead remake and I understood why it was getting better reviews . Now I've seen The Ladykillers and I understand even more . Tom Hanks , as is to be expected , delivers a spot-on performance as an intellectual from the deep south , brilliantly pulling off not only the accent but the demeanor and earthily classy mannerisms as well . Not that I'm some expert on the deep south , but consider his introduction into the film , when he knocks on Mrs . Munson's door and reluctantly pursues her escaped cat ( ' Won't the cat eventually pine for its masters affections and return of its own initiative ? ' ) . I love stuff like that . You don't just come up with dialogue like that , it takes a lot of talent to enhance the complexity of a simple sentence like that . The film has started off on the right foot . And then , of course , you have Marlon Wayans , the most catastrophic casting decision in the entire film by far . I'm confused by his impressive performance in Requiem For A Dream , because in every other movie I've ever seen him involved with he has been an absolute disaster . His ridiculous character screaming mind-numbing streams of profanity single handedly ruined this movie , the Scary Movies , which he wrote , are some of the worst , most sickening slop I've ever seen recorded on film , and Senseless and White Chicks are two movies that I am determined never to see . I'll watch a movie even if I know it's going to be a disaster ( I've seen all three Scary Movies , for example ) , but this time I'm putting my foot down . I can't even IMAGINE sitting through White Chicks , and no amount of curiosity about the formation of Marlon Wayans ' idiot iconography will persuade me to watch Senseless . I'm struggling not to swear off on sight anything that he is ever involved with again . Look at Jamie Foxx , for example , another actor whose career sprung from the dregs of television , In Loving Color . He's certainly been in his share of tasteless roles , but has built up his career to the point where he is generating Oscar buzz for his massive performance in the upcoming Ray , not to mention other great films like Ali , Collateral and , to a slightly lesser extent , Redemption . Wayans is still running around acting like a complete moron in ridiculous roles like this one , single-handedly destroying what should have been a classy and clever remake of a classic . Then again , maybe it's unfair to compare Jamie Foxx and Marlon Wayans , since Wayans could never hope to possess the tiniest fraction of the talent that Foxx has , but you have to have your limits . Never in my life have I seen a Tom Hanks movie that made it so easy to picture him trying to hide his face at the premiere . What kind of a turn is this for the Coen brothers , who generally have characters so rich and interesting that they overshadow most of the rest of the film ? Their movies are not about their stories , they're about the characters . In this film , every single character

Text2: Unbelievable . First of all , I had no idea there was this kind of obsession with Rubik's cubes . I knew that there was sort of a whole sub-culture revolving around this peculiar little toy , but I thought that was back in the 80s and maybe early 90s . What is amazing to me is not that the Rubik's obsession is alive and well or even that there continue to be people trying to come up with new and exciting ( bizarre ) ways to solve it , what is amazing to me is that there are actually people , two of which are featured in this short video , whose job title is "" Rubik's Cube Documentarian . "" I really had no idea that there was enough history to the Rubik's cube to necessitate people to have careers documenting and studying it . What do these people do on a daily / weekly basis ? Head on in to the office and see if anyone has shaved a few hundredths of a second off of the standing record ? I feel like I know about 75 % of all I need to know about the thing from watching this six minute video ! On the other hand , there is definitely a lot of fascinating information here . There are some statistics given about the toy , such as that it has 43 "" quintillion "" different possible positions , and that if you were to move one piece every second , it would take 1 , 400 million million years to create all of the different combinations . Now , if I have my zeroes and commas calculated correctly , that's 1 , 400 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 years . Unbelievable ! ! This will be why so many people have developed the obsessions that they have , some of which last years and years and years and have even spawned medical conditions and support groups . I always thought that the Rubik's cube was just a fad that I missed out on , since I was never any more than passively interested . Maybe because I could never figure the thing out and would lose interest before I made much progress . This video makes me glad that I never got very seriously into it ! One thing that is hugely interesting to me is that because of the Hungarian architecture professor who invented the puzzle , Hungary was able to rise out of Communism in the 1980s . This is quite an interesting statement to me because at the moment I am living in the heart of China , and the current government is intensely Communist and fiercely perpetuates the mythology of Mao Tse-tung , who is quite literally revered like a God here despite being personally responsible for more deaths ( more than 70 million ) than any single person in the history of mankind . Communism is mentioned in this video as sort of something that Hungary escaped from , which is quite a statement in the environment in which I find myself . Also interesting , and a little disturbing , is the idea of solving the Rubik's cube blindfolded . A kid named Leyan Lo is the current world record holder for the fastest blindfold solve . When I heard that , the first thing I thought is that the kid really needs to get a life , but it is definitely pretty interesting to watch these people's hands working so fast that you can hardly see the fingers move , it's incredible . Also , go to Youtube and look up "" cup stacking world record . "" This is another "" super-geeky "" fad , as it's described in the video , that is pretty amazing . So whether or not these people need to get a life is not really anyone's business , I guess . Whatever blows your hair back , as they say . But one thing is definitely certain , these people have WAY too much time on their lightning - fast hands .

A smooth , egomaniacal serial killer who fancies himself a connoisseur of extraordinary women holds his victims captive in an underground lair , and only murders them when they break his rules . However , he makes two crucial mistakes : first , when he nabs the violin-playing niece ( Gina Ravera ) of a famed , exceptional Washington D . C . forensic psychologist ( Morgan Freeman ) who is determined to find and save her . Second , when another of his intended victims ( Ashley Judd ) manages to escape from him - and becomes just as determined to save the other girls . Although in some ways a standard-issue Hollywood-made Cop Vs . Killer Movie , it is professionally handled , well-acted ( especially by Freeman and Judd ) and watchable throughout , so that it ends up a little above average . It does feature an important plot twist I haven't seen in any other movie like this . A couple of quibbles , though : 1 ) The killer's identity may be too easy for some to guess . 2 ) Considering the way Alex Cross ( Freeman ) ultimately ID's the sicko , you'd think SOMEBODY else would have been sharp enough to notice this evidence . Still , I considered it time well spent . Of course , I'll watch anything Morgan Freeman is in ; the man is just phenomenal , carrying the picture in his usually quiet , authoritative manner .


Text2: An entertaining adventure . Greg Collinson ( Doug McClure ) has devised an experimental diving craft and , along with British scientist Charles Aitken ( Peter Gilmore ) , uses it to explore the depths . They end up in the underwater city of Atlantis , whose citizens intend to have Aitken join them , hoping to exploit his superior intellect . In addition to fighting off assorted monsters , McClure , Aitken , and their associates set off on a daring escape . One could complain about the cheesiness of the whole affair , or the less than stellar special effects , but for me it still adds up to likable , undemanding fantasy escapism . It's quite colorful and interesting . Most importantly , I felt it was reasonably exciting , with decent direction by Kevin Connor and respectable pacing . The monsters may not be that high tech , but I'd still take these kinds of creations over CGI any day . It just adds to the true old-fashioned , Saturday matin√©e type appeal of the whole thing . Michael Vickers ' rousing score is simply wonderful . McClure is a stolid hero , and the supporting cast is fine . Special guest appearances are made by Cyd Charrisse and Daniel Massey as high-ranking Atlantians . Especially effective is under-rated character veteran Shane Rimmer as Captain Daniels , with Michael Gothard , gorgeous Lea Brodie , Robert Brown , and future ' Cheers ' mailman John Ratzenberger all enjoyable in smaller roles .

Text2: Read Fisher Forrest's summary - - it says it all When I read the summary of the featured review for this film by Fisher Forrest , it sure said it all - - "" Ridiculous and trite , but it is fun to watch "" . I couldn't have summed the film up any better . Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray starred in seven movies together and while they are all a lot of fun , this one is certainly pretty silly and trite . However , given the actors ' ability to make even bilge watchable , this film turned out pretty good thanks to their professionalism and talent . With lesser talent in the film it might have struggled to even earn a 4 or 5 - - the plot idea is that silly and forgettable . Claudette plays a woman a lot like Clare Boothe Luce , though instead of writing articles for "" Life "" and "" Vogue "" , Claudette is a high-powered photojournalist . Her boss doesn't particularly like her , so he assigns her to to a photo essay on ' sandhogs ' - - men who build tunnels . It's a dirty job but not wanting to be seen as too temperamental , she agrees to the assignment . Once there , the film starts to become a bit goofy . You see , when she sees the √ºber-macho Fred without his shirt on and muscles bulging , she is smitten with a desire to go slumming ! And her infatuation only gets worse when she seems him get into pointless fights that make absolutely no sense and are so very contrived . Although Colbert is prim and proper and would never admit that she likes to see Fred kick butt , it's obvious to everyone she is smitten . However , it takes another hour until the completely expected final clinch to occur . The biggest deficits in the film are the silly clich√©s and ridiculousness of the relationship between these people from two totally different worlds . I assume some studio exec must have noticed this , too , as towards the end you find out that Fred isn't really a sandhog but a talented engineer who happens to like working in the muck - - making the pairing seem not quite so silly and vulgar ( after all , he's a college graduate ! ) . Fun despite the terrible dialog and plot . However , don't think too much when you watch this film , as it might make your head explode ! !

501,"Text1: "" Hullo and welcome to Dirty Dick's "" I have a vague memory of watching a very funny show on New Year's Eve sometime in the early Eighties , starring the late , great Rikki Fulton . As I was in the grip of alcohol at the time , its title did not register in my memory , but I knew it to be good . Ever since then I've wanted to know , and see more about this whimsical show . I'm greatly indebted to my friend Powrman for recommending ' Scotch & Wry ' . This long-running sketch show from B . B . C . Scotland was never networked ( apart from the 1982 Special ) . Presumably the suits thought it too parochial , but if so they were wrong . Having recently watched a number of shows on D . V . D . , I can say with absolute confidence its one of the funniest shows I've ever seen . The sketches were fairly long - some running as long as seven minutes - but this was an asset rather than a drawback as it gave the cast - Fulton in particular - a chance to flesh out their characters . His long-faced vicar - The Rev . I . M . Jolly ( "" Ah've had a helluva year ! "" ) - was so popular he went on to front a number of specials . Also in the cast for a long time was Gregor Fisher , later to go on to ' Naked Video ' where he stole the show as ' Rab C . Nesbitt ' , and Tony Roper , who played ' Jamesie Cotter ' . The quality of the sketches is extremely good ; John Byrne of ' Tutti Frutti ' fame being a contributor . As is the norm with sketch shows , various stock characters evolved ; as well as the Rev . I . M . Jolly , there was also the inappropriately named ' Supercop ' , slovenly television chef ' Dickie Dandruff ' , and wide boy McGlinchey . But Fulton's ' Last Calls ' made the show special . Those of us who remember when television stations used to close down at midnight with the ' Epilogue ' recognise only too well what is being parodied here . One of the best sketches had Fulton - as a different priest - getting progressively drunker whilst on air . Fulton is best remembered in the rest of the U . K . for his roles in straight dramas such as ' Charlie Endell Esquire ' ( in which he played a vicious gangster who had the wonderful line : "" Porno magazines don't run ' Spot The Ball ' contests ! "" ) and ' Bergerac ' . ' Scotch & Wry ' shows us he was capable of so much more . I haven't watched all the episodes . I'm saving a few for New Year's Eve ! No wonder this programme - and Fulton - is so greatly revered in Scotland .


Text2: "" Hullo ! Siadwel here ! "" ' A Kick Up The Eighties ' and ' Laugh ? I Nearly Paid My Licence Fee ! ' laid the groundwork for this classic sketch show which , despite spawning two spin-offs - ' Rab C . Nesbitt ' and ' The Baldy Man ' - strangely seems to have fallen off the radar . The early editions opened with Andy Gray and Helen Lederer reading spoof news items similar to those of ' Not The Nine O'Clock News ' . Lederer herself wrote and performed monologues in which she played a tipsy bimbo . My favourite recurring character though was Siadwel , a geeky Welsh poet played to perfection by John Sparkes . In filthy anorak and N . H . S . spectacles , Siadwel regaled us with such stunning observations on life as : "" Uncle Pob wouldn't put his dog in the kennels before going on holiday . He said it was cruel . So he drowned him . "" . Sparkes eventually left to appear in Channel 4's ' Absolutely ' . Later programmes had Gregor Fisher as Gus , the boisterous newsreader of the Outer Hebrides Broadcasting Corporation ( O . H . B . C . ) . Some of the humour could be sick , such as the man accidentally decapitating commuters with a hedge trimmer . One particularly brilliant sketch featured the cast as ' The Broons ' , a comic-strip Scottish family well known to readers of ' The Sunday Post ' . Each show closed with Thatcher roaring like the M . G . M . lion . This was later changed to John Major issuing a mouse-like squeak ! Special mention should be made of David McNiven and his wonderful songs . ' Naked Video ' was , for my money , one of the best sketch shows the B . B . C . has ever made .

Seuss's "" Horton Hatches the Egg "" was the first cinematic adaptation of a Dr . Seuss book . And a good one at that . While it does change a few small things , it mostly stays faithful ( like Horton is 100 % ) . Oh , and just in case you operate under the assumption that this is just cute stuff for children : Michael Maltese , in his screenplay , also threw in a some things that moviegoers in 1942 would have understood but 21st century tykes probably won't get ( including a brief instance of mild sexuality on the bird's part ; look what she does to attract Horton's attention ! ) . I definitely recommend this cartoon . Clampett doesn't make quite as much use of contortion as he does in some of his more famous cartoons , but he still pulls off some fine work . The combination of talent from Seuss and Clampett should identify that you're in for something neat . This was one of the many Warner Bros . cartoons released before 1948 that lost its opening credits in the Blue Ribbon reissue .

Nina Foch is terribly miscast as Holden's moll . When an icy Holden puts a bullet in the back of the warden after dropping him off , Foch calmly says , "" Al , dear , did you really have to do that .

Text2: Rocks Around the Clock "" The Monolith Monsters "" follows the usual scenario of Universal's 1950s monster movies . An ill-understood menace threatens the town ( or the country or mankind ) . Men wearing uniforms try to deal with it , but it's the scientists who come to the rescue . ( Sounds like the Cold War . ) In this case - - in this inexpensive and late case - - the imagination of the writers had just about reached rock bottom . The "" monsters "" are rock pylons generated by a meteorite . They grow at a phenomenal rate when they are in contact with water , sucking all the silicon out of whatever material they touch , including human flesh . The victims are turned to stone . The meteorite has landed on a mountain top in the desert , but unfortunately a rain storm activates it . These huge black towers grow visibly , then crash and splinter into hundreds of smaller pieces , which grow in turn . The rock itself looks something like obsidian , flinty , shiny , and smoothly fractured . The local geologist and the sheriff are at a loss and they call in "" the professor , "" whom everyone calls "" the professor . "" Together with the local newspaper editor ( the reliable Les Tremayne ) and with the help of the supernumerary Lola Albright , they experiment on rock samples and try to find something that will check their growth . Nothing seems to work . The colossal towers are crashing inexorably towards San Angelo and , beyond that , "" the citrus region , "" after which there will be no stopping them . At the last moment , the antidote is discovered . The rocks stop growing when they are exposed to salt water . And fortunately there is a salt mine just outside town , and next to it a dam which must be blown up , so that the released water can rush over the salt mine and out into the salt flats and tell those rocks where to get off . The formula was getting kind of old by 1957 , I guess . Much of the story is easily anticipated . Some of it is shamelessly ripped off . A young girl at the site of an early and mysterious catastrophe that has killed her parents , is found wandering about in shock . She doesn't blink when a hand is waved in front of her eyes . ( Cf . , "" Them "" . ) Sherwood's direction is strictly functional . If a group of six people is standing together , as in the last shot of the film , they don't huddle together . They stand in line and congratulate each other sideways , so that we can see them and all their faces at once in medium shot . And though the monsters make a lot of noise , crashing about through the canyons , they're not really as scary as , say , a giant tarantula would be , because they move so slowly . On top of that , they're insensible . They aren't alive , so they can't see anything or chase anything or eat anybody . The dialog seems to have been written in a hurry . Lola Albright : Dr . Higgins says that the girl has only eight hours . Maybe . Les Tremayne : And maybe - - not ? Albright : Maybe not . Yet , there is something unspeakably creepy about the sinuous colonies of black towers . The texture of the colony is revolting . It's like looking at a photo of a skin disease with pustule crowding against pustule . Yukk . And the fact that the rocks are mindless puts them in the category of things that can't be outwitted , like disease or death itself . It's a short , minor film , but I kind of enjoyed it . Despite the urgency , the tone of the movie is relaxed , as if nobody was really putting too much effort into it . And it's always fun to see the 1950s monster formula invoked for still another go .

So while you bask in our bounty and wealth Remember September 12th . The tragedy that is going on in Darfur today , where 400 , 000 have been murdered , countless numbers of women have been gang-raped , and 2 . 5 million people are in virtual prison in refugee camps makes September 11th seem like a traffic accident . Yet , despite the carnage and the real evidence that what happened in Rwanda is occurring in Sudan , we do nothing , just as we did nothing in Rwanda . Darfur is not a threat to anyone and is of no benefit to anyone , so no one cares what happens to them . Add to that the fact that they are Africans , and you can understand the message of this film very clearly . George Clooney narrates a compelling story that should be seen by everyone . He is assisted by standout journalist , Nicholas Kristof , and Elie Wiesel , who is there to remind us that we did say at one time , "" Never Again . "" Well , it is happening again , and we do nothing . The Bush administration gives lip service to Darfur , while they are dealing with the government of Sudan to obtain information to aid them on their terror campaign . Sudan has something we want ; Darfur doesn't . The actions this administration is taking against Iran , would have solved this crisis long ago if they were implemented against Sudan , but Iran has something we want ; Darfur doesn't . Almost 3 , 000 Americans died on September 11th , but thousands are dying every day in Darfur . Can we continue to look the other way and call ourselves a "" christian "" nation ? The only flaw in this compelling film was the fact that it didn't seem to flow smoothly . But what is that compared to the message it is sending to the world ? Michael Moore could have done a better job , but we can't wait any longer .

Text2: A painful miscarriage of a film . . . First and foremost I'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie "" Embryo "" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses ( animal as well as human ) aged 12-16 weeks . The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase . Okay , in all honestly , I didn't know all this , but I took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of "" Embryo "" could have done . Don't worry ; I'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter , as there are several more reasons to state why "" Embryo "" is a huge failure . Actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible , and thus Science Fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious , yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences . By depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong , or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light-years of void , filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and , at the same time , teach them useful little trivia about science . In order to make a good or at least halfway-decent Science Fiction movie , writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule : DON'T be boring ! If they can't fulfill this one condition , the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book . Something must have gone wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's "" Embryo "" . The basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving , as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies . There also were some very prominent names involved in the production , like main stars Rock Hudson ( "" Giant "" , "" Seconds "" ) , Diane Ladd ( "" Chinatown "" , "" Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore "" ) and director Nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics "" Soldier Blue "" and "" Charly "" . Then what went wrong ? Simple . The script is irredeemably boring , clich√©d and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery & scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with . Rock Hudson , in a very poor performance , plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away . When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night , his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals ' fetuses . He manages to keep one fetus alive , impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog . Because his procedure is so successful , Dr . Paul Holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide . The female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate , however , and after only a couple of weeks she's a full-grown , ravishing and super-intelligent woman . The good doctor naturally falls in love with her , but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects . . . Absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film , apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog . That second half of the film does contain a little bit of ( grotesque ) action and suspense , but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot-twists already ruined the potentially fabulous Sci-Fi idea . There are some really cool scenes , most notably the chess-showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall ( in a highly memorable and ultra-obnoxious supportive role ) . The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous , and it almost feels like Ralph Nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller & Sci-Fi cinema . The last sequence , including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end , certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film . But anyway , my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers . An animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film .

A murder committed by non other the the boy's father . Music professor John Russell , George C . Scott , is trying to get over the terrible tragedy of the deaths of his wife and young daughter Jaonna & Kathy , Jean Marsh & Michelle Martin , in a traffic accident in upstate New york . Taking some time off and then moving to Seattle Washington John rents the Chessman House outside the city from the local Historical Society . Desperately needing peace and quite to both compose his music and forget his past , the deaths of Joanna & Kathy , John ends up getting neither with the house suddenly coming to life in the form of the ghost of a young boy who was murdered there some 70 years ago . At first thinking that it might be the plumbing John soon realizes that what's happening in the Chessman House is not of this , or of the living , world . John getting in touch with Seattle Historical Society curator Claire Norman , Trish Van Devere , the two find this secret room in the attic that housed a young and crippled , with his wheelchair still being there , boy . Checking out the records of the Chessman House it's found out that the house belong to the now powerful Washington State Senator Joseph Carmichael's , Melvyn Douglas , parents ! Something just doesn't check out here with the house through it's strange and unexplained noises as well as a reading from world famous medium Leah Harmon , Helen Burns , that shows whoever is making these sounds has been dead for over 50 years ! If the dead child , or ghost , in question making these strange sounds isn't Senator Carmichael , who's very much alive , then who is he ? Did the senator have a twin brother that nobody knew about ? John who at first would never believe all this ghostly and supernatural hogwash is now convinced that there was something to the story about a murder at the Chessman House and that somehow Senator Joseph Carmichael , who was just an infant when it happened , gained the most out of it . With the information that he got from the medium Leah as well as his recording of it , that picked up sounds that were inaudible to the human ear , John tracks down the remains of the murdered boy to Elizibaeth Gray , Frances Hyman , house . It's the Gray house that was once the property of Senator Carmichael's father and it's there , in a now sealed and buried well , where the young boys body was found ! Also found there is evidence that the murdered boy , also named Joseph Carmichael , not Senator Carmichael was was the elder Carmichael's son ! With this discovery on both John and Calire's part the awful truth about Senator Carmichael starts to come out and the Senator then uses all of his power and influence to keep it from seeing the light of day even if he has to resort to bribery or even murder . The movie "" The Changling "" takes a while to get off the ground but it has so many loose ends to tie up , before it really gets down to business , that you can't be critical of it for it's almost snail-like pacing . When the film explodes in the last ten minutes you already know what's the secret behind the house and Senator Carmichael's connection to it . John whom the Senator completely misunderstood , in what his actions were , was more the willing to put the whole thing behind him . But it was the ghost of young Joseph that wouldn't let go and it was that ghost that in the end saw to it that pure justice , as brutal and indifferent as it is , without as much as a glint of mercy was finally done and done at the Senator's expense .

In this film , he shows a frigidness , never depicted by him before in films . He appears afraid and incapable of any human relationship . How the two find their way to love is an inspiration to us all . The early part dealing with the separation of radium from barium was tedious at best . Not one to be a science scholar , this is some ways reminded me of a horrible chemistry teacher that I had in high school . She too was frigid and very incapable of forming lasting relationships . Fine support is offered from Albert Basserman and Henry Travers , the latter being memorable in "" Mrs . Miniver "" as well . Dame May Witty briefly appears as Pidgeon's devoted mother . The resurfacing of Garson , Pidgeon , Travers and Witty was like a reunion of the Miniver characters . Garson really pours on the acting as the film develops .

I was only 11 when the movie was released and I was absolutely in love with it , in fact right after the movie was done , I wanted to become a storm chaser . That's how much I loved this movie ; I grew up and forgot about the movie and decided on a new career . But I saw the DVD on sale and thought about how much I enjoyed the movie when I was younger , I'm sure it would be just as much fun to see it again . I have to say this wasn't as awesome as I remembered , in the theater it was like "" Oh , my God ! Look at that flying cow ! A house just flew across the road ! That is so cool ! "" , now on my TV screen I was like "" Oh , wow , look at that cow . How the heck does a house fly across the road ? Why isn't this as cool as I remembered it ? "" Not to mention that the story wasn't as good as I remembered , granted I know that they had to fit in some kind of story with the whole plot of the twisters , but a lot of this movie is just plain unrealistic . In June 1969 on an Oklahoma farm a tornado warning is issued , the family seeks shelter in a storm cellar as an F5 tornado strikes . However , the storm is so strong that the locks on the cellar door fail and the father is caught up in the storm and killed as his daughter struggles to catch a glimpse of the powerful storm . Years later , Dr . Jo Harding , the father's daughter , is reunited with her estranged husband ; Bill Harding . Bill is a former weather researcher and storm chaser who has taken a job as a weather reporter . He is planning to marry his new girlfriend , Dr . Melissa Reeves , and arrives at Jo's research lab seeking Jo's signature for the final divorce papers . Bill discovers that Jo has built a tornado research device called DOROTHY based upon his own design ; the device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure . The team later meets up with Dr . Jonas Miller , a smug and unscrupulous fellow meteorologist and storm chaser . When Bill discovers that Jonas has "" invented "" a device almost identical to DOROTHY ; he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea . Bill and Melissa join Jo and her eccentric team of storm chasers . Tensions rise between Jo and Bill when they have several close calls with dangerous tornadoes as they try unsuccessfully to deploy the new device . So how does Twister hold up over these years ? Not so well , the effects are still amazing , but that's about it . I do have to admit , even though it's a bad movie , I still enjoy it like crazy . I think because if you let go of how unrealistic it is , you can just have fun with that want of destruction and chaos . Granted I know this movie is a bit stupid : our two leads , Bill and Jo , survive the impossible facing an F5 twister , the twisters always disappear as our "" hero's "" are in danger , Bill's fianc√© puts up with quit a bit before realizing that he is a jerk for putting her through all the danger with him , Jo , a scientist , thinks that tornado's are serial killers , and not to mention that this was a record breaking day with numerous twisters . But still as bad as the acting , as bad as the story , as stupid as some of these situations may be , it's still a fun movie to watch and I think I wanna be fair with the rating just because it is mindless entertainment . It's a classic 90's disaster movie and besides , it has flying cows , what other film will give you that kind of situation ? But it's all good I think they were taking the cows to McDonald's anyways .

Maybe it was for the best ; his presence on screen is very ( and I mean this as a compliment ) French in tone and inflection and even in style of speak . In English he fares reasonably well , and gives a solid performance as the "" gypsy turned peasant "" Bobo who saddles up with ex-suicide-attemptee Ida Lupino on a tiny bay community . This being said it's a kind of character that works for Gabin's limitations in the language . Because Bobo is a Gypsy it works that Gabin's English is only so fluent and has the kind of facial expressions that reflect that ( as opposed to say Grand Illusion where he was so natural that it was staggering ) . Lupino , thankfully , is a great match , and the two have some very nice scenes together as a married couple who face trouble when one of Bobo's prior troubles comes back to haunt him , even as it wasn't his fault . The direction is competent and the writing has some moments of cleverness or tenderness or even insight . And as the drama ratchets up one gets involved if only on a perfunctory , conventional level . But the director Archie Mayo ( replacing , of all directors , Fritz Lang ) some moments that really stand out for me . One that I might never forget , and should stand up among some of the quintessential early 40s noir films , is when Bobo has his drunken binge the first night at port and after causing a ruckus in the bar with punching out the guy and making the girl upset goes from bar to bar . In a montage that provides a drunken angle to the camera and editing tricks , we see Bobo going further and further , hearing characters repeat things like "" drink , drink "" or whatever and it is purely intoxicating to see this . It's the kind of sequence , which lasts a good long 5 minutes , that almost promises this to be a great film . It isn't , but it was worth a shot , and for those who are curious or just big Gabin or Lupino ( or Claude Rains ) fans , it's worth a shot .


Text2: An enjoyable work of subtly sinister Gothic horror . At the turn of the century , Dr . Paul Eswai ( Giacomo Rossi-Stuart ) is called upon to conduct an autopsy on a girl who has died under suspicious circumstances . He arrives to find a bunch of cagey and frightened villagers who fear the curse that they have to live with . As part of my intent to broaden my horizons and explore more foreign horror , I watched this nice little horror film from Mario Bava , perhaps the greatest master of Italian horror of all time , based on recommendations here , and the film does not disappoint . A very rich film to look at , it evokes its era very well , with wonderful sets and photography . Bava infuses it with a healthy amount of atmosphere ; many outdoor scenes include a healthy amount of fog , and the indoor sets have portions completely covered in cobwebs . The sense of impending doom is strong ; the thought of what secrets might be revealed helps to keep the film engrossing . It's made all the more effective by a moody and ominous music score . Finally , the film does wonders to make the sound of a little girls ' giggle disturbing rather than appealing . Rossi-Stuart isn't bad in the lead , but it's the lovely ladies in the supporting roles that really command attention , particularly the incredibly alluring brunette Fabienne Dali as Ruth , the sorceress . I also liked Piero Lulli as the Inspector , and Luciano Catenacci ( a . k . a . Max Lawrence ) as the burgomeister . Any fan of period horror pieces would be advised to check out this entertaining entry ; it can easily rival anything made by Britain's Hammer studios . Short and economical ( even working with a low budget Bava really gets the job done ) , it gets right down to business and moves at a respectable pace . I definitely enjoyed it . Bavas ' son Lamberto ( later director of the 1980's gore favorite "" Demons "" ) was assistant director here .

This is simply a brilliant filmic interpretation of a classic play - Ben Johnson was writing out of London around the same time as Shakespeare - and features a director , Maurice Tourneur and two leading players , Harry Baur and Louis Jouvet , at the top of their games . For good measure there's also strong support from Fernand Ledoux and a great time is had by all . Tourneur switches effortlessly from crowd scenes to duos and trios and Armand Thirard's camera-work is exemplary which may explain why Tourneur took him to Continental that same year . This is a going away .


Text2: The Dwight Stuff This snuck into London this week virtually unheralded and playing at only one cinema . By chance I stumbled on a paragraph that mentioned the star was Brenda Blethyn so on that basis I checked it out . It's yet another of those ' indie ' productions that is fine to see once but probably won't stand repeat viewings . Blethyn plays a stand-up comedian who apparently made a minor name for herself in seventies Britain prior to emigrating and is now trying to reestablish herself in Sydney . For good measure she is divorced - from a Country singer who moonlights as a Security Guard , just as Blethyn moonlights as a canteen worker - and struggling to retain control of her two sons , one of whom is brain-damaged and the other a virgin . One of the problems is that the film can't decide whether to concentrate on Blethyn's attempts to make a living on the club scene , though the material that we actually hear - incredibly and unbelievably credited to Jo Brand - makes this highly unlikely , or the burgeoning love affair between the non brain-damaged son and a new girlfriend , played well by Emma Booth . Basically this one has ' feelgood ' written all over it and it that's what you like then you'll like Clubland aka Introducing The Dwights .

514,"Text1: Good enough but hardly the best the genre has currently to offer . This is a good looking and also rather cute movie . However the story is lacking and I just can't help seeing this movie as a missed opportunity . Like often is the case with animated movies , there is a morale to find in the movie as well . They did not only tried to put one moralistic message into the movie but more than a couple of them . The story suffers from this , especially toward the ending of the movie . It also has as a result that not all of the messages work out well enough in the movie , because the one is more obvious and prominently featured than the other . Perhaps the movie should had stayed put more to its main story-line , instead of diverting so much with its side-plots and characters . It would had made the movie overall more consistent and the its morals and messages all the more powerful as well . The movie showed some more potential really with its songs . The movie uses some famous evergreens and combines several songs brilliantly ( done by John Powell himself ) . The dancing routines from the penguins all add to this as well . As a purely musical orientated movie , this would had been a great movie to watch I'll bet . But like I said before , the movie chooses the divert constantly from its main-plot , in order to develop and create some overly present morals and messages . It's a good looking movie , so nothing wrong in the graphic department but it also isn't exactly anything new or spectacular looking . When computer animated movies were still new , they really put some time and effort in those movies , with as a result some visual spectacles . When the big studios realized some serious money was to make from those movies , dozens of movies got created each year , preferable for less money and done in less time , in order to raise the profits even more . "" Happy Feet "" is obviously one of those movies . Nothing wrong with this if the movie actually still entertains and knows to grab you . Overall this movie does entertaining but I also must say that the movie could had been made way more entertaining as well . The movie isn't filled with an awful lot of jokes and more leans on its cute looking - and odd characters . However when the movie makes some hits , it really hits and knows to entertain and make you laugh . Like most animated movies , this movie also has an impressive A-list voice cast , with people such as Elijah Wood , Brittany Murphy , Hugh Jackman , Nicole Kidman , Hugo Weaving and of course expert Robin Williams . It's an overall watchable and entertaining enough movie from George Miller but the story just didn't do it for me .


Text2: Not entertaining enough and the movie lacks a real point . For a Christmas movie - and a children movie in particular , this movie is really lacking in entertainment and likability . It's very simple to say why this movie is not entertaining enough . It's too artificial . Sure , the computer effects are beautiful looking and it's a really big achievement but it makes the movie also very artificial looking and therefor the movie has absolutely no magic feeling in it at all . Because of that very same reason , the characters are too shallow and the story itself is not involving or entertaining enough . I really don't understand why this movie had to be made entirely with the computer . The movie totally lacks human emotions because of this and the whole ' magical ' feeling feels forced and fake . To be frank , I just don't see how this movie is much good as a children's movie . There is nothing to enjoy in this movie for the kids . There aren't really many jokes present and the characters that are in the movie are not really likable or easy to relate with for the kids . They even have no names . The story also has little entertainment value because it's not consistent enough and the events in the movie are just only highly unlikely and are not made to look believable at all . And in general , the movie is more creepy and dark looking than cheerful and happy . What an odd choice for a children Christmas movie . The movie relies too much on its ' magic ' feeling . . . a feeling that is not present in the movie at all . Therefor "" The Polar Express "" is nothing more than a beautiful looking failure . The story is extremely simple and is told way too weak in the movie . Basically the story is one unlikely and even odd event after the other without them making an obvious connection . I'm also still puzzling what the message of this movie exactly was . I'm pretty sure of it that it's ; Believe in Christmas . But it is never explained in the movie why . Other Christmas movies with these kind of messages also have a morale and explain why it's so beautiful to believe in Christmas and how it makes the world a better place . Not in this movie . The message of the movie is basically muddled in the effects and visual look of the movie . It also helps to make the movie a very forgettable one . And really , did Tom Hanks had to play basically every male character in the movie ? I really like Tom Hanks as an actor but to be honest he is not good enough as a voice actor , in terms of putting diversity and character into the different characters through his voice . Every character he plays sounds the same and maybe because of that the movie also gets too distracting and for some confusing to watch . All of the characters in particular also aren't much special . Most of them are totally obsolete and some of the characters are also highly peculiar portrayed in the movie . For instance all of the elves aren't nice at all in the movie and they didn't exactly made a friendly impression on me . They were even a bit villainous . The way Santa Claus is presented in the movie is also totally wrong . In the movie they made him look like a sort of tribe leader that is treated as a king and is worshiped by all as if he is some sort of God . He is not a friendly , cuddly , cheerful guy at all in this movie . The musical score by Alan Silvestri also got highly annoying after a while . Basically it's the same ' magical ' main theme being played over and over again . The motion capture techniques work out pretty good in the movie and also the animations themselves are really good looking most of the time . There also is some good action , so obviously the movie still has some good things to enjoy . It's of course far from the worst movie ever but also far from the most entertaining one . More was to be expected from a director like Robert Zemeckis , who before this gave us entertaining movies like "" Romancing the Stone "" , "" Who Framed Roger Rabbit "" and the Back to the Future trilogy . OK maybe it's because I'm European that I don't like this movie . I mean","{""output"": ""YES""}"
515,"Text1: He's Fallen into the Water ! Harry Edwards was a new director when he turned out this Keystone in the house style - - fast , furious and not making much sense . It takes place in the space between a swimming pool and the ocean and the three plots - - Poppa wants a drink , Raymond Griffith wants Julia Faye - - which certainly makes sense - - and the fat guy , who I think is Albert Gillespie , but I wouldn't take a Bible oath on it , wants to jump into the swimming pool , which , of course , pushes everyone else out . People keep falling into the ocean , and even the Keystone Kops show up here , but other than a lot of splashing and Julia and Raymond standing out as human-looking among the grotesques , it's all confusing . For once , the editing , which was always topnotch at the studio , fails , as it runs the three stories concurrently , like Griffith's INTOLERANCE . That's D . W . Griffith , not Raymond . I'd give this one a miss , unless you're pining for a view of everything Keystone .


Text2: Gollywhoppers ! A nice little second feature , the last directed by silent perennial Chester Franklin - - brother of Sidney Franklin , with whom he co-directed a lot of children's movies in the teens . We needn't go too much into the details of the plot , which are pretty harmless as you might expect of anything with Rin-Tin-Tin Jr . and Jackie Cooper away from his home base of MGM . However , it is a pleasure to watch Joseph Calleia , who was almost invariably cast as a gangster in evening clothes - - his best known role was probably as the sexually ambivalent boss of Glenn Ford in GILDA - - as a tough guy reformed by Coop's innocence and , of course , Rinty . He does very well with the role .

Text2: Magical Mystery Tour . . . . . . and I DO mean magical . But then why not , the script is the work of Jacques Prevert who enjoyed nothing more than dabbling in fantasy - see : Les Portes de la nuit , Les Visiteurs du soir if you don't believe me - and the direction is by his kid brother , Pierre . This was the third and last time the brothers worked together and Voyage Surprise is a worthy follow up to Adieu , Leonard , three years earlier . With the possible exception of Martine Carol - who featured in the odd soft-porn like Caroline Cherie and later played Lola Montes for Ophuls - virtually the entire cast is unknown outside France and that is the world outside France's loss because every last eccentric is worth ten Tom Cruises . If I told you the plot you wouldn't believe it ( as I wouldn't if you told it to me ) so suffice it to say that an old man realizes a lifelong ambition to host a ' Mystery Tour ' in a custom-built bus that might have been designed by the guests at the Mad Hatter's tea party to transport the denizens of Wonderland through the looking glass and into the ' real ' world of 1947 .

517,"Text1: Perfect Love Another frank depiction of sexual obsession from Breillat which , despite several instances of full frontal nudity , is not particularly graphic until a short orgy sequence in the film's latter stages . While the film is rather long and talky , it is also surprisingly compelling , aided considerably by its two excellent central performances , particularly Isabelle Renauld's ; its semi-documentary / flashback framework , then , leads to a shocking , inevitable finale . Having a relationship with a beautiful , mature woman is every young man's dream and , for a while , Francis Renaud lives it but before long , his unwillingness to let go of his chauvinistic male friends ( who are prone to graphically describe their sexual prowess in front of his female companion ) and seriously commit to his relationship is too heavy a burden for them both ; ironically , it is Renaud's attempt at taking on the role of father-figure ( by taking an interest in Renauld's teenage girl ) which triggers off the differences between them and which keep escalating as the film goes along . Out of the three films I've watched so far from this interesting and controversial French film-maker , this is certainly the best so far and I'm looking forward to catching more of her work in the future . Luckily , I've managed to convince my pal at the local DVD rental store to add the Criterion DVD edition of Breillat's A ' MA SOEUR ! ( 2001 ) to his already impressive library . . .


Text2: I'm young I never worry about time SPOILERS Out of gas in the seedy and non residential side of L . A aerospace engineer Walt Sherill , Alan Ladd , looking for a gas station is almost run down by a gang of drunken preppies . After giving them a piece of his mind the car goes in reverse and the well dressed and well spoken hooligans confront the startled Sherill who work him over where he ends up with a concussion and broken left leg . It's when Sherill gets in touch with the police that his young tormentors not only target him but his wife Tracey , Dolores Dorn , as well . The movie "" 13 West Street "" is a lot like the Charles Bronson urban crime thriller "" Death Wish "" that was released 12 years later . In the film Sherill at first goes to the police and when he does't get the results that he wants goes on his own trying to track down and exact revenge against those who left him a crippled and later tried to both murder and rape his wife Tracey . Ulike in "" Death Wish "" Sherill goes after only those who did him in not just any street hood who gets in his way , using himself as a decoy , like Charles Bronson did in that movie . Trying at first to let the police track down and arrest his attackers Sherill gets impatient and hired a private detective Finny , Stanley Adams , to do the job . It turns out that Finny despite finding those who brutally beat Sherill tails them in his car losing control by driving some 80 to 90 MPH and ending up dead at the bottom of a ravine . The hoodlums themselves are lead by by this conceded and what seems like stuck up , on those who are law abiding citizens , spoiled brat named Chuck , Michael Callan . Chuck gets so carried away in tormenting both Sherill and his wife Tracey that even his fellow criminals try to distance themselves from him . Bill , Arnold Merritt , one of Chuck's hangers on gets so guilt ridden at what he did to Sherill that he's murdered by Chuck , who made it look like a suicide , in order to keep his fellow hoodlums in line and from talking to the police . Det . Koleski , Rod Steiger , who's on the case has so much trouble in keeping Sherill from going off the handle and ending up not only killing any of his attackers but even innocent persons who get in his way almost has Sherill arrested for his own good . Meanwhile Chuck , who wasn't all there upstairs to begin with , gets this bright idea to break into Sherill's house and show just what a man he really is by raping his wife Tracey which alerts the cops who catch him both red handed and with his pants down . Running back to mommy and daddy , who've been covering up for him all this time , Chuck is caught by surprise by a cane swinging Sherill who after breaking his head almost drowns Chuck in his parents swimming pool . Sherill has to thank Det . Koleski for coming to his rescue not that he really needed him but to stop him from killing Chuck and ending up behind bars himself . P . S With all the comparisons to the movie ' Death Wish "" there is a scene in "" 13 West Street "" that left me a bit startled . This happens when Sherill in his hospital room , with a cast and clutches , slips and falls on the ground and is unable to get up by himself . In pops this young man who at first you think is one of those who put him there in the first place . It turns out that the young man , Adam Roarke , is visiting his mom in the room next to Sherill who helps him up and gives him back his clutches . Adam Roarke looks so much like a young Charles Bronson that for a moment I almost thought that he was actually him !

Some twenty years ago I was amazed to see a photo of Sylvester Stallone , a fully grown man , solemnly pulling the same stunt in some publication like "" People Magazine . "" "" The Specialist "" is an expanded version of that photo of Stallone's already expanded biceps . I can't think of many other movies in which we see more of the hero's nude and preposterously overblown bronzed body than we do of the heroine's . ( Too bad , Sharon Stone hasn't much more than that to offer . ) Stallone just can't seem to keep his clothes on . He's always taking showers , walking around with towels around his waist , doing exercises , lying back on a bed with some kind of purple kimono coyly draped over his groin while Stone kneels worshipfully at his feet and runs her hands up his oh-so-muscular legs . I wonder if Stone was jealous of all Stallone's nude scenes . The plot ? Oh , the plot . Well - - you've got me there . You see , Stone wants to knock off these bad guys who killed her parents .

Text2: Dick Laurant Is Dead ( There are Spoilers ) Not really a story but a mind altering nightmare for jazz saxophone player Fred Madison , Bill Pullman . Fred goes through a life-changing experience that has him go through the film at first as a victim of a brutal crime where his wife Renee , Patricia Arquette , is murdered . Then later Fred become a participant of another murder of porno film maker Andy , Michael Massee . It's after that where he's evolved into an entirely different person altogether ! Then later back to being himself Fred Madison as he again becomes involved in yet another brutal killing in the slashing / shooting of a murderous mob boss Eddy aka Dick Laurent ! All this is with the help of this creeped-out looking Mystery Man , Robert Blake , who pops up in the movie in a number of scenes , unannounced and unexpected . The Mystery Man looking like he was made up to be an over-aged and over plastered Japanese Geisha Girl . The nightmare begins for Fred when he receives in the mail , with no forwarding or return address , a video tape of his house an later another tape of not only his house but himself and his wife Renee sleeping in bed . Going to the police Fred is told that they can really do nothing since no crime , other then voyeurism , was committed . Earlier we see Fred invited to this strange party where he's introduced to a friend of Renee named Andy who in turn introduces him to the Mystery Man . The Mystery Man tells Fred that he not only knows where he lives but that at this very moment he's in Fred and Renee's house ! Calling home on the Mystery Man's cell phone Fred is answered by the Mystery Man himself who seems to be at two places at the same time ! As both we and Fred are trying to figure what exactly is happening in this weird movie that were watching he's suddenly arrested for the murder of his wife Renee and put on death row , without the benefit of a trial and conviction , waiting execution . Freaking out to whats happening to him Fred then seems to morph into a much younger man named Peter Dayton , Balthazar Getty , in his jail cell . The warden then has no choice but to let him go free . We then learn that Peter was arrested some time ago for car theft , and given a years probation , and lives with his parents William and Candace Dayton , Gary Busey & Lucy Butler . Peter also has this hot to trot girlfriend Sheila , Natasha Gregson Wagner , who's always taking off her clothes when she's with him as both her and Peter are almost always eagerly making out with each other . If it wasn't for Fred coming back on the scene later in the movie I had the feeling that actor Bill Pullman walked off the set being disgusted in what he was offered to play in the film and was replaced by actor Balthazar Getty without the writer / director David Lynch not bothering to re-shoot the scenes with Pullman in them !

After developing a serum , and with only a few hours left before facing his hanging , Dr . John Garth ( Bortis Karloff ) decides to inoculate himself with the use of blood deriving from an executed murderer , with tragic results . Granted a reprieve by the governor with his sentence reduced to life-in-prison , Garth finds that he's actually getting younger , but the blood from the murderer used in the serum which was inoculated in his veins contaminates him with an uncontrollable urge to kill which places innocents in danger . In fact , Garth strangles Howard before a thief enters the lab , with a scuffle killing the man . Garth is considered an innocent harmed in that scuffle when in fact he was the man behind both deaths . Released a free man , his old friends he wishes to inoculate become targets thanks to the inner desire to kill , one by one victims of handkerchief stranglings . Garth will hope to pass on knowledge to his daughter's fianc√© Paul ( Bruce Bennett ) before turning himself in to the proper authorities . But , will he be able to do this before the urge to kill actually threatens the life of daughter Martha ( Evelyn Keyes ) ? Meanwhile , the police suspect Garth might be behind the stranglings and investigate accordingly . Nice little 60 minute B-movie programmer with a fine performance from Karloff as the tragic victim of corrupted blood , an experiment gone awry . Many will find similarities to many films he was making at the time , playing scientists who meant well , falling prey to unforeseen circumstances regarding unusual experiments often rejected by the medical community at large . The "" victim of science "" theme isn't fresh by today's standards considering so many films have been made since this film concerning scientists / doctors and their attempts to advance the medical field / life through unorthodox means . I think Karloff's sympathetic performance reels in the viewer and the film is nicely produced adhering to the typically blessed Columbia Pictures studio system where even low-budget offerings carried a polished look and style ( . . see "" Cry of the Werewolf "" for further proof ) . Karloff was always adept at portraying characters far older than he was and this ability is used here where he starts out as a man perhaps 60 or so , looking younger as the film continues . You expect nothing less than excellent when Karloff headlines your movie . I relish the fact that there many of these less heralded films in Karloff's resume still left for me to discover . So often we back his career into a corner where he's known for his Universal and Val Lewton films , when there's a plethora of little underrated titles ready for the viewing public .


Text2: "" If you want time buy the magazine . "" Entertaining enough but rather shallow . The Fast and the Furious is set in Los Angeles & starts as undercover cop Brian O'Conner ( Paul Walker ) enters an illegal street race between racers with high performance sports cars , he bets his $80 , 000 car that he'll win but instead loses . Suddenly the cops show up & he manages to save Dominic Toretto ( Vin Diesel ) from being arrested , Brian gains Dominic's trust in an attempt to use his knowledge & contacts to identify & take down a gang of street racers who are hijacking huge container trucks & stealing millions of dollars of electrical goods . . . This American German co-production was directed by Rob Cohen who has a small cameo as the pizza delivery guy & is an entertaining action flick without ever reaching the heights of greatness . The script by Gary Scott Thompson , Erik Bergquist & David Ayer moves along at a reasonable pace & has decent amounts of action but it never quite satisfied me totally in any area . The plot is predictable & pretty standard fare , the twists have little dramatic impact like the revelation that Brian is a cop or that Dominic is behind the hijackings . A lot more could have been done with them . I usually don't take the moral high ground but in the case of The Fast and the Furious I feel I have to considering the age group this will appeal too , I mean it turns the criminal element into hero's which didn't sit well with me especially at the end when the cop is more concerned about the scumbag hijackers than the poor innocent truck driver ! This isn't as action packed as you might like either , sure there's a good opening street race through LA & some good stunts during the final hijack but otherwise it's all show & no substance , just like the cars featured in fact . There are plenty of scenes with high powered cars reeving their engines , plenty of scenes of nicely painted sports cars driving around & plenty of scenes of them breaking the speed limit but it doesn't really amount to much apart from the opening race & the final twenty minutes . The character's are OK if a bit clich√©d ( I mean Brian actually starts to respect Dominic after being around him for a while . . . ) , it keeps one interest & it certainly passes the time harmlessly enough without ever being outstanding . Director Cohen does OK & turns in a suitably glossy looking film that will probably appeal to the boy racers out there as it glamorises the notion of street racing , winning at any costs & show's these souped up sports cars in as good a light as just about any film out there . The cars themselves look nice enough for sure & they are a pleasant distraction whenever on screen I suppose , at least they divert attention away from the acting . The film has some style about it for sure , the opening street race for instance when they reach top speeds the lights outside the windows blur into one long bright line & there are other tricks used as well to make a cool sequence . The violence is minimal so there's no need to worry about that .

Some day , some French cine buff will give a chance to "" La Fille Aux Yeux Gris "" and discover that Fred Zinnemann's "" five days one summer "" ( 1982 ) took its most mind-boggling idea from a forgotten obscure black and white French flick . Like in "" Service De Nuit "" , the screenplay is brilliantly written , but with better results . All the characters are vividly depicted whereas , with the exception of two of them , the heroes of Faurez's debut were rather flat . Sometimes melodramatic , sometimes wonderfully romantic ( I'm waiting for a rendezvous ; If I am not here anymore , you'll meet her ) , sometimes a movie of redemption ( the last lines for once do not concern the youth , but an old couple , sort of something like "" Should I fall behind , please wait for me "" ) , and even a detective story ( probably the least satisfying side of the movie ) Fernand Ledoux is the stand out of the movie , in a much more interesting part than in Faurez's Poesque "" Histoires Extraordinaires "" which is , of the four Faurez movies I had the opportunity to watch , the weakest .

Text2: Average killer creature feature . Kaw is set in the small American town of Evermore where it's the Sheriff's ( Sean Patrick Flanery ) last day , however his last day becomes a bit of a nightmare . First he's called to a farm where a man is found dead , then reports from all over town stating that big black Ravens are attacking the population come in . The Sheriff soon realises that the Ravens have turned & are attacking & killing the residents . . . Edited & directed by Sheldon Wilson who also gets a visual effects supervisor credit one has to say I quite liked Kaw up to a certain point . The script by Benjamin Sztajnkrycer ( pronounce that if you can . . . ) takes itself pretty seriously & as everyone else has already pointed out Kaw is more or less a remake of the classic Alfred Hitchcock flick The Birds ( 1963 ) , for what it is I thought it was OK actually & better than I had expected . Unfortunately the lack of gore , the lack of consistency of the Ravens ( sometimes they attack , sometimes they just sit there , sometimes they try to break windows to enter buildings while other times they don't ) & an absolutely terrible ending which is the main aspect of Kaw that annoyed me . After the Sheriff & an assorted bunch of survivors hold up in a caf√© & after a few hours leave as all the birds are just dying & that's it the Ravens just drop down & die which is rather underwhelming to say the least & not much of a pay-off . The idea that the Ravens have become killers because they ate the flesh of cattle infected with Mad Cow Disease is also a trifle hard to swallow & just doesn't make a lot of sense because as a disease it doesn't actually turn the carrier ' mad ' as it were . Director Wilson does alright , the film looks nice enough although I'd have liked a bit more gore . There's a scene when a Raven pecks at the top of someones head & pulls some brain matter out , a Raven is seen pecking at someones leg which is down to the bone , there are some gory cattle carcasses & there are a few dead bodies covered in blood , not much to get excited about really . The Raven themselves are a mixture of real birds & CGI computer effects & overall the special effects are very good . Obviously Ravens are pitch black so the effects don't need any detail which helps I suppose . There's a nice foreboding atmosphere for the first hour as the bird attacks increase & there are some cool shots of rows of sinister looking Ravens sat on roofs & fences just watching people walk around but it does tend to fall apart at the end as the film peters out into nothing . Technically the film is fine , it's certainly well made with decent special effects & well trained Ravens . Shot on location in Hamilton in Ontario in Canada . The acting is alright too , Rod Taylor who plays the small town Doctor here also appeared in Hitchcock's The Birds just to reinforce the connections & similarities between the two films . Kaw for the first hour or so was a really neat little nature on the rampage type horror flick but the lack of gore annoys & once Mad Cow Disease is given as a reason for the killer Ravens together with a really disappointing & flat ending it sort of falls apart . Good but could have been so much better .

Text2: Totally worthless . . . Much more frightening than the actual movies themselves is the fact that one continues to discover slasher movies that were released in the 1980's ! This decade truly is an inexhaustible source for low-budgeted and inane horror pictures that often ended up in oblivion shortly after coming out . "" Deadly Games "" is such a prototype example of the ? righteously ? forgotten 80's slasher ! The plot and characters are derivative , the killings are unimaginative and the attempts to insert humor are downright pitiable . Tension apparently was an unavailable option as well . The plot drags slowly and spends way too much time focusing on bimbos and losers cheating on each other . Past halfway in the film I still hadn't figured out which characters are sleeping together whilst they aren't supposed to , and who the hell cares about that anyway ? The strange murder of a voluptuous town girl ( sadly , the hottest chick dies first ) reunites a group of old friends and makes them speculate together about what could have happened . One of them is a copper ? though not a very convincing one ? investigating the case , one girl is the wannabe cynical sister of the first victim and all the rest are dispensable dorks . There are plenty of bone-headed who are waiting , no ? BEGGING to get slaughtered but nothing happens . At a certain point , the ultimate low point of the film , you're actually watching at how three of the characters ( one of them being the copper ) sit in a theater and see a film ? for several long minutes ! What's the freaking point ? ! ? And why can't that chick stop talking to herself or at least realize her jokes and one-liners are totally not funny ? If the theater scene wasn't painfully dire enough yet , they carry on playing a board game and football whilst the most abysmal 80's song can be heard . How is this relevant ? And you , you stupid cop , shouldn't you be looking for the killer ? In case you haven't noticed yet , "" Deadly Games "" is one of the worst and most redundant slashers of the entire 80's , and that's saying something , since we mentioned the inexhaustible offer before . It doesn't even deserve to be called a slasher , as the slashing is next to none ! This is a pile of steaming rubbish about a bunch of losers struggling with midlife crises whilst still in their early thirties . Avoid like the plague .

526,"Text1: Cronenberg's Latest Feels Less Important Than "" A History of Violence "" I have a love / hate relationship with David Cronenberg , or maybe more aptly a like / hate relationship with him . I liked "" Naked Lunch "" and "" The Fly . "" I hated "" Crash . "" I loved "" A History of Violence , "" and on the strength of that film , and the fact that he was re-teaming with Viggo Mortensen , came into "" Eastern Promises "" with high hopes . So did I like "" Eastern Promises ? "" Yes . Did I love it ? No . It's the kind of movie that feels haunting while you're watching it , but it left me surprisingly unmoved after it was finished , and nothing about it really lingered in my head , which was not the case with "" Violence . "" I think maybe the difference is that "" A History of Violence "" felt completely of a piece with the current cultural climate ; it felt resonant . "" Eastern Promises "" tells a much more contained and , in my mind , contrived story that doesn't have much to say about anything outside of the world of the film . That's not to say that the film itself doesn't tell an interesting story , but I'm not sure it tells a very important one . Mortensen plays the driver of a Russian mafia crime boss ( Armin Mueller-Stahl in a sinister , mesmerizing performance ) who crosses paths with a young and pretty nurse ( Naomi Watts ) when she gains possession of a diary left behind by an immigrant prostitute who dies giving birth . Watts becomes the protector of the young girl's baby , for reasons of her own , and becomes obsessed with discovering the truth about the girl's death and holding those responsible for it accountable ( "" those "" happen to be the very Russian mafia that Mortensen works for ) . Stahl's attempts to "" deal "" with the situation are foiled unbeknownst to him by Mortensen , for reasons that we don't fully understand until the film's final moments . All of this sounds juicy enough , and at times the film is quite an effective little thriller , but on screen the whole story is just a little too scripted to ever be believable . I also thought Cronenberg resorted to cheap tricks at the end , when he puts a baby in danger to create a race-against-time finale ; it felt desperate , like the product of a screenwriter who didn't know how else to end the movie . Watts is wasted in her role ; her character's not especially vivid . Mortensen gives a very good performance , but his character's not as interesting as he first appears . The more we learn about him , the more we realize that any complexity given to his character is a result more of plot twists than of psychological motivation . Cronenberg brings a highly homoerotic charge to the film - - much of the film's action is driven by the fact that Stahl is embarrassed by his gay son , who isn't man enough for the role he needs to fill . And in the film's most memorable scene , a completely nude Mortensen fights savagely to the death in a Turkish bath . I commend Cronenberg for this scene - - in our movie culture , it's been completely acceptable for ages to juxtapose naked female flesh to violence , but when the same is done with a male body , people sit up and take notice . My biggest complaint with the film is Cronenberg's use of shock violence . Like so many violent films , this one makes us ask the question : at what point does graphic violence stop making a point and merely become a fetish of the director ? Would the scene in the bath have been any less effective had it not ended with a close-up of Mortensen stabbing a man in the eye with his blade ? Unfortunately , that appeared to the be the film's money shot , if the young college boys next to me whooping it up at that point were any indication . I just felt that moments like that cheapened the overall effect of the movie . So , Cronenberg didn't knock this one out of the park for me . It's definitely a movie I'm glad I saw , and it's bound to be a conversation starter , but I don't think it's a movie I'll remember as one of this year's best .


Text2: Winning Pair in a Slight Neil Simon Effort There's nothing really to dislike about "" The Odd Couple , "" and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a hugely winning comedic team . But there's something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full-bodied film . I have not seen the play , but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful , since Simon wrote it , so the defects cannot be blamed on a stage-to-screen adaptation . There are some interesting ideas in this story - - two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently - - that Simon never fully fleshes out .

527,"Text1: Very Cliched And Dated As a child I used to love all those old war movies set during the second world war but as I grew older I grew to dislike them . The majority of WW2 war films are American of course with a subjectively American point of view ie the Yanks won the war single handed . Not surprisingly two WW2 war films I still love today are DAS BOOT and CROSS OF IRON both of which are German productions . WHERE EAGLES DARE is a British film but suffers from many of the faults as its American counterpartsThe screenplay was written by the late Alistair MacLean at a time when even his shopping lists would be produced into blockbusters . MacLean was a schoolteacher by trade but was famous for his meticulous research into the subjects he wrote about which makes WHERE EAGLES DARE doubly disappointing : The Germans / Nazis are portrayed as being cruel and very stupid , they're also very easy to kill because unlike the British and American characters they find it impossible to shoot straight . In fact it's totally ridiculous the way Eastwood's character is able to fire two machine guns at once and throw back the Germans grenades without getting a scratch . In truth the Germans were very efficent on the battlefield while being very cruel off it . Maybe I'm a bit hard on the movie since it's not really a war film but a spy story set during the war , a bit like a James Bond film where Anton Differing is Blofeld . It's also interesting to see Richard Burton play a very similar character to Bond since he was once a candidate to play Fleming's character and if his performance here is anyhing to go by he might have outdone Connery as a sadistic assassin but probably would have been less convincing as a sophisticated womaniser . There's also a brilliant twist where it looks like Smith isn't who he claims to be but this is the only moment of brilliance in a film with cliched portrayals of Germans and rather poor production values ( Check out the myriad of scenes featuring some painfully obvious back projection ) which won't appeal to an audience in 2003

PATSY KELLY is her slovenly maid who sees through the whole thing and takes an instant dislike to Todd's suitor .

The film itself is decent , if unremarkable ( in all honesty , the book is probably not as good as it seemed when I was 10 ) . It has fantasy elements , but they are so ( thankfully ) sparse that they feel like they were invented just to put them in the commercials . They aren't ( very ) annoying when they're there .

Text2: Two great female performances Vanessa Redgrave is "" Mary , Queen of Scots "" in this 1972 film which stars Glenda Jackson , Patrick McGoohan , Timothy Dalton , Ian Holm and Nigel Davenport . What a pity that young people today don't have a chance to see the great Jackson , who has retired , or Redgrave , who no longer plays leads in films . These two women are powerhouses playing two completely different types of women - Elizabeth ( Jackson ) is powerful , distrusting and manipulative , while vulnerable , sensitive Mary is in way over her head . The story covers the death of Mary's husband in France and her arrival in Scotland to be their Queen . The history behind this is fascinating , since Mary was something like 9 months when she was first made Queen of Scotland . One of the things that made her reign controversial was her Catholic faith ; Ireland was Protestant . Since Mary is a legitimate daughter of James V of Scotland and Elizabeth is considered by Catholics to be the illegitimate daughter of Henry VIII , as she was conceived before Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn , her cousin Elizabeth sees her as a threat to her own crown . Mary would be next in line to ascend the throne ( also controversial due to Henry VIII's Act of Settlement , which forbade Stuarts to inherit the throne ) . Elizabeth goes to any lengths to protect her position . She sees through Mary immediately , realizing she has no political sense , and manipulates her into marrying the conniving , bisexual Lord Darnley ( Dalton ) , who later tries to secure the throne for himself . Mary gets it from all sides , including her half-brother , Jamie , a Protestant who acted as Regent in Scotland while she was in France , betrothed as she was at the age of 5 . With the birth of her son , James ( who became James I of England and James VI of Scotland ) , Mary fights as best she can so that her son will one day rule . The acting is magnificent from all of the stars ; it would be impossible to choose one as better than the other , though certainly McGoohan , as Mary's brother , and Ian Holm , as Riccio , had excellent roles that showcased their abilities . But they're all wonderful . The scenery is gorgeous . In the ' 60s and early ' 70s , these dramas about English royalty were all the rage , making for complicated , interesting stories and fascinating , real-life characters . It looks like now , they're returning again . The film world needs them , as they represent a return to three-dimensional people , compelling history and - dare I say it - good leading roles for women .

And this time , he's got the same co-stars : DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY . It must be said that Tierney here is under-used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to Andrews . He plays a tough , hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him . When suspicion falls on a cab driver ( TOM TULLY ) , he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because he's in love with the cabbie's daughter ( GENE TIERNEY ) . Tierney , by the way , looks a little too elegant for the girl she's playing here and doesn't seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story . The story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero . By the end , it turns into a morality tale with Andrews developing a conscience over his crime . It's fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast .

Text2: Cleverly contrived plot with a stunning Herrmann score . . . Brian dePalma really accomplished quite a feat by paying homage to Hitchcock with a strong variation on VERTIGO's theme - - a man who loses the woman he loves sees her reincarnated in another woman and then loses her too . He takes this premise and does some fancy camera-work that swirls around the lovers with an intensity only matched by the whirling colors of Bernard Herrmann's magical score . He sets up the tale by having a convincing kidnapping take place in which his wife and daughter are taken by the criminals and has him mourning their loss until he encounters another woman in Italy , years later , who strongly resembles his presumably dead wife . The rest of the plot must remain undisclosed for "" spoiler "" purposes , but I'm sure there are those who will at least have a suspicion as to the real purpose of all the foregoing events . CLIFF ROBERTSON has the difficult chore of appearing downtrodden and depressed most of the time , so GENEVIEVE BUJOLD has the task of brightening up the tale with her unconventional good looks and upbeat manner .

It's the men who dominate the film and Wyler gives them all a chance to show what they can do . The film itself is a bit overblown , even for an epic western . As the most villainous of BURL IVES ' sons , CHUCK CONNORS stands out in a very aggressive role as the gang of four who welcome Peck to "" the big country "" by taunting him with reckless energy as they lasso him , tear his hat off , shoot at it , keeping his fianc√© , CARROLL BAKER in check to witness their humiliating tactics . But Peck is a gentleman from the east , a Sea Captain returning to the west to marry the woman he thinks he loves and his way of dealing with bullies upsets his fianc√© who fails to understand his values and always underestimates him . As it turns out , JEAN SIMMONS becomes the real woman for him - - and after many a plot turn he ends up rescuing her from a fate worse than death after she's captured by Ives and his unruly , cowardly son Connors . It's a complex story of an age old feud over water rights that involves , principally , Ives and CHARLES BICKFORD as the headstrong men who are unable to settle a score peacefully even when Peck tries to intervene . It's an epic tale , sprawling and a bit rambling over the course of two hours and forty-five minutes , but Wyler holds it all together for maximum interest , aided and abetted by a wonderful western score by Jerome Moross that has become classic . Peck never had a role that suited him so admirably and CHARLTON HESTON is excellent as Bickford's right hand man with unwanted designs on Carroll Baker . His fist fight with Peck is a classic of its kind . And ALFONSO BEDOYA ( tbe grinning bandit from TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE ) as Ramon , the sometimes dull-witted hired help with his halting English , is excellent . Summing up : A sturdy but overblown western with a classic score , full of strong performances by an expert cast .

Could this get any worse ? ! Well , yes , because while the music does sound lovely , Neil Diamond also sings several songs that made "" Heartlight "" ( sure to be included if there was a "" reasons to hate the 1980s "" list ) seem hard-edged ! So what positive things do I have to say about the film ? Well , the cinematography is lovely and must have been spectacular on the big screen .

Alas , her dad turns out to be away on an errand . Penny starts to see the corpse of her father all over the place . However , her kindly stepmother Jane ( well played by Ann Todd ) insists that he's still alive . Has Penny lost her mind ? Or is someone trying to drive the poor girl mad ? Ably directed by Seth Holt , with a clever and compelling script by Jimmy Sangster , a genuinely spooky atmosphere ( the scenes with the father's dead body are pretty creepy ) , handsome black and white cinematography by Douglas Slocombe , sturdy acting from a super cast , a properly shivery score by Clifton Parker , a gradual , yet steady pace , and one doozy of an unexpected surprise plot twist towards the very end , this tidy and absorbing thriller keeps the viewer guessing right to the stirring and startling conclusion . Strasberg simply shines in a rare substantial starring role ; she makes for a charming and sympathetic heroine , cuts loose with a few great full-throated screams , and , of course , looks absolutely gorgeous throughout . Moreover , there are fine supporting contributions by Ronald Lewis as affable chauffeur Bob and Christopher Lee as mysterious , concerned physician Dr . Pierre Gerrard . A solid and satisfying winner that's well worth seeing .


Text2: A first-rate early 60's end-of-the-world sci-fi classic A harsh , gritty , rough-edged and hard-hitting low-budget early 60's post-nuke end-of-the-world survivalist classic from the always reliable exploitation movie outfit American International Pictures . It's one of the first and finest of its type . Close-knit Los Angeles suburbanite family the Baldwins - - rugged , quick-thinking take-charge dad Ray Milland , worried mother Mary Mitchell , equally resilient chip off the ol ' block son Frankie Avalon , and whiny , attractive jail-bait daughter Jean Hagen - - drive their car and trailer out of Angel City just before it gets creamed in an atomic bomb mushroom cloud blast . Society takes an immediate nosedive into every-man-for-himself anarchic barbarism . Milland takes his family up to the relatively safe mountains in order to better their chances of staying alive , fending off hostile gas station attendants , antsy small town locals , ruthless , increasingly desperate fellow survivors and a gang of vicious teenage hoodlums led by perennial juvenile delinquent baddie nonpareil Richard Bakalyan . Milland's terse , clearly focused direction , working from a gutsy , provocative , extremely intelligent , grimly serious and at times surprisingly witty script by Jay Simms and John Morton , further enhanced by strong , credible acting ( even the usually wanting Avalon holds his own , with an especially fine performance by the fetching Joan Freeman as a feisty young lass the Baldwins rescue from the thugs ) , barbed , tough-talking dialogue , Les Baxter's blaring , brassy , wildly swingin ' beatnik jazz score , a stark , no-frills , most convincing cut-to-the-bare-bones style , Gil Warrenton's crisp black and white cinematography , several shocking outbursts of raw violence , an aptly gloomy tone , and a highly unnerving , tension-packed sense of rapidly escalating fear , distress , unease and paranoia as civilization promptly falls apart at the seems ( the bustling , hopped-up speeding car sequences and deadly solemn infrequent radio broadcasts are positively harrowing ) , creates a frightfully plausible , hellishly absorbing and downright chilling portrait of the nerve-jangling shambles the world could possibly be reduced to following a devastating nuclear holocaust .

First of all , even though I like to think of myself that I know a little something about 70's euro-exploitation and its most prolific contributors , I never heard about Joseph W . Sarno before . Here's a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult-laden exploitation movies and I haven't seen a single one ! How ? Why ? What happened here ? Secondly , and even worse , just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies , that director's most famous and supposed "" masterpiece "" turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film . Admittedly , lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole , but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality ( like Jos√© Larraz ' "" Vampyres "" or Harry K√ºmmel's "" Daughters of Darkness "" ) . Joseph Sarno's film has nothing to offer , except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly . The events take place in a secluded old castle , hidden deep in the German mountains , where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty ( literally ) baroness . Her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle's catacombs , which are lit by penis-shaped candles ? AUCH , and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now . Suddenly ( don't even ask how ) the castle is full of young and sexy female guests , so even more erotic rites ensue . Sounds delicious and entertaining enough , but "" The Devil's Plaything "" contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members ' ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable ! Sarno isn't capable of creating suspense or building a Gothic atmosphere ( or maybe he just didn't bother to ) and the actresses ' capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face . Please do yourself a favor : no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian-vampire movies of the 70's , this one isn't worth a penny ! Even the repertoires of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are pure art compared to this dud .

538,"Text1: For opera lovers "" I Dream Too Much , "" nicknamed "" I Scream Too Much , "" is a 1935 film starring opera singer Lily Pons and Henry Fonda , who at this point in his life resembled Jane Fonda in a man's haircut . He was really at the height of his most adorable-ness . Fonda plays a composer named Johnny Street who marries a young woman , Annette , only to discover that she has an operatic voice . In attempting to push his opera , she sings some of it for the head of the opera company in Paris . He makes her a huge star and Johnny is stuck on the sidelines . When he finds out that she is paying for a production of his opera , he leaves her . This is a slight story no doubt prompted by the success of Jeanette MacDonald and Grace Moore that relies on the voice and personality of Lily Pons and the cuteness of Fonda . Eric Blore plays a neighbor who has a trained seal ; he's there for comic relief , and he was always funny . Pons was a huge opera star who actually sang for the last time in 1972 , when she was 74 years of age ! She was tiny at a time when opera stars ran very big , she was very glamorous , and her timing was impeccable - she arrived in America during the Depression and saved the Metropolitan Opera from bankruptcy . Her signature aria was the Bell Song from Lakme , an opera done infrequently today if at all . In it , she wore a bare midriff costume and showed off her F above high C and her coloratura technique . She was an ideal Rosina , Gilda , Lucia , Linda di Chamonix , etc . Women singers in those days were trained a little differently than they are today , with back placement of the high notes . Pons ' middle voice and extension above high C were lovely , but the notes from F to high C had a shrillness to them , at least in recording . Her speaking voice records shrilly as well . This is actually a sweet film that the actors make enjoyable . I could have done without the long , dragging number at the end , but it's a chance to see one of opera's legends and a very young Fonda .

539,"Text1: A stagey setting for a florid melodrama from John Huston . . . While KEY LARGO is certainly no masterpiece , it IS highly entertaining , thanks largely to two larger than life performances from EDWARD G . ROBINSON ( at his mightiest ) and CLAIRE TREVOR ( who manages to steal every scene she is in as a lush past her prime as a torch singer ) . But it's not quite the sort of thing Bogart and Bacall fans were used to . Lauren is much more demure than usual , very low-key but earnest in her performance and she does well in a part that is not quite as sultry as her other roles of this period . Bogart too is low-key in a rather colorless role ( for him anyway ) , as a soldier who drops in on Bacall and her father ( Lionel Barrymore ) at a hotel in the Florida keys to give them information about her soldier husband . The oncoming storm is nothing compared to the histrionics of EDWARD G . ROBINSON who chews up all the scenery in sight as a gangster almost as black-hearted as his Wolf Larsen in THE SEA WOLF , even though most of the scenery is confined to a couple of hotel settings . Surprisingly , for a film directed by John Huston , he has allowed the storm aspect to be the least realistic part of the setting . It all seems to take place on a Warner sound stage with banging shutters and loose pictures on the wall , but not much of a storm to be concerned about except when miniatures are shown of a very strong tide and a hotel battered by winds and rain . But these are minor squabbles when all the performances are edgy and wonderful , particularly Thomas Gomez , Dan Seymour and Marc Lawrence . But it's CLAIRE TREVOR and EDW . G . ROBINSON that have the most powerful roles and they play them with every bit of professionalism they can muster - - and that's plenty . Trevor has never been more effective and richly deserved her Supporting Role Oscar . Some of the film drags , burdened by too much of Maxwell Anderson's stage dialog which tends to give a static look to some of the scenes , but the last half-hour is full of vigorous movement as the story reaches a satisfying climax . If you're looking for a typical Bogart / Bacall film , this is not it . But it is good , solid entertainment .


Text2: Dark exploration of man's inhumanity to man . . . Despite all the realism depicted in THE GREY ZONE amid the actual day to day operations of a Nazi prison camp , there's a certain stage quality in the dialog that serves as a reminder that you're watching the screen version of a stage play and not what should seem more like a true life documentary . That's the fault of the script taken from David Mamet's play and other eye-witness sources - - but the acting is excellent . And yet , it does manage to convey just how those prison camps used other prisoners to operate the gas chambers , to carry out the deed with false promises - - "" Just be sure to remember where you hook the clothes so you can pick up your belongings when you leave "" - - and the backbreaking jobs of loading trucks with dead bodies and depositing them on chutes that go directly into a blazing furnace . Amid all this , various stories are entwined involving the petty quarrels among the men assigned to these tasks so they could prolong their own lives for at least four months of assured survival . The story involving a girl who does not die during the twenty-minute gassing and is then revived and how the men argue over how to protect her from further harm , is intense and touching in that it shows the humanity that is still in their souls . Her story and how it ends is one of the film's most memorable and touching elements . This is more of an in depth look at "" the final solution "" than any other recent films dealing with the extermination of Jews has ever been , with the exception of SCHINDLER'S LIST and THE PIANIST in which the accent was more on the triumph of the human spirit and a much broader view of the war itself in epic mode . This is a darker , intimate look at the actual operation of the camps as experienced by a handful of prisoners - - the brutality , the torture , and raises the question : how far would you go to survive ? It also shows how not all the Jews were as passive about their fate as some have claimed , often opposing the Nazi officers and paying for it with their lives . In the hands of a greater director , it might have been an even more impressive film than it is , so that I'm unable to place it in the same class with the two films mentioned above . The cast is uniformly good , but HARVEY KEITEL is outstanding as an SS Commander keeping strict tabs on the camp's hard-working doctor . In its own way , it's just as important . Young students of history would be well advised to view this one for a better understanding of how "" the final solution "" was supposed to occur and the methods used to carry out an enormous project known as "" the holocaust "" .

"" In the opening scene , the eye patch wearing desperado named Hawkeye has a smooth forehead , but when he follows Johnny into the pueblo , he's shown with a scar over his patched eye . That's just one of the many continuity lapses in this edgy ' spaghetti ' Western , but rather than detract from the picture , it adds a special flavor to the proceedings . Another occurs when Sanchez turns in his three dead bodies , they have to be examined for their identities - "" You just can't imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town "" . Immediately after , Carradine ( Lawrence Dobkin ) shows up to collect his bounty with no more than a wanted poster in hand . As for the film's principal Johnny Yuma ( Mark Damon ) , he's shown with his holster alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging gun belts with Carradine following the barroom brawl . Johnny's bound for San Margo at his uncle's request , but will have to avenge his death at the hands of deceitful wife Samantha ( Rosalba Neri ) and her conniving brother Pedro ( Louis Vanner ) . It takes some time getting there , but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record . As for that saloon fight , I got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected . Care for some more story exaggerations ? Following the duel with Pedro the first time , Johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear Pedro's entire face with . Similarly , when Pedro smacks around little Pepe later in the film he doesn't cut him , but by the time Johnny arrives , Pepe's face is covered with blood . "" Johnny Yuma "" is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn't have Clint Eastwood in it . As Johnny , Mark Damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior . Carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory Lee Van Cleef character , without being a total bad guy . At first the identity exchange between Carradine and Johnny didn't seem to make sense , but it all tied together by the time the film ended . You knew each henchman would wind up getting his due ; marking time for each was part of the anticipation . In case you're wondering , the title hero has nothing to do with the Nick Adams character from the classic TV Western "" The Rebel "" . In this film , Johnny got his name from a gunfight he had in Yuma once . Perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it tied things up with the evil Samantha who pulled the strings behind the scenes throughout . After shooting Carradine she beats a hasty retreat before Johnny can get his revenge . Still alive , it looks like Carradine tries to shoot her and misses , but it doesn't take long for Johnny and Sanchez to track her into the dessert where she perished without water - Carradine aimed for her canteen .


Text2: Hadn't seen this since I was in grade school , and surprisingly it held up wonderfully ! This is a movie that I watched a lot as a kid , having taped it off ( I presume ) HBO . It's one of those movies that stays with you . I haven't seen it since I was in grade school , but , watching it now , I'm not sure if I forgot even a second of it . It was the first feature film made entirely with clay . Mark Twain plans to fly his airship to meet up with Halley's Comet . Three of his most famous characters , Tom Sawyer , Huck Finn and Becky Thatcher , stow away on the ship . When discovered , Twain makes them his crew . On the ship , they are told some of Twain's stories , and here plenty of his famous witticisms ( almost all of Twain's dialogue is made up of his nuggets of wisdom ) . The movie starts off pretty slow , and some of the comedy early on is only moderately amusing . However , as it moves on , the film becomes darker , discovering the cynicism and sadness that exists in the works of Mark Twain . The most memorable sequence has the children meeting Satan , inspired by the posthumously published work The Mysterious Stranger . My other favorite segment is from The Diaries of Captain Stormfield , where a man arrives at an alien version of Heaven . Thanks go to the Onion's A . V .

Text2: When did this movie take place again ? Okay , I'm not going to waste your time blabbering on and on about twelve-story ocean liners being made in the 19th Century , because I don't think it's something that needs to be pointed out . We all know that suggesting the existence of a cruise liner like that in 1899 is absolutely ridiculous , although it speaks volumes about the movie that such a massive break with reality needs not even be mentioned because it's already so obvious . The automatic suspension of disbelief can only be expected to go so far . On the other hand , The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is not a movie that presents itself as intending to be taken all that seriously . It's clearly an adventure film made purely for entertainment purposes ( and not in the slightest way meant for any kind of cognitive or logical appreciation ) , so there are some goofball things in it that are certainly expected to be taken in good fun . Like , for example , the fact that absolutely nothing in the film makes any sense . Let's assume that you can overlook the fact that not only does an ocean liner of that sheer magnitude exist in the late 1800s , but it is also able to cruise casually through those miniscule canals in downtown Venice . You know , the ones that are spider-webbed with tiny pedestrian bridges every block or so . I hate to say this , but I've never even been to Venice and I still knew enough to slap my forehead when I saw that . If you're able to swallow THAT , you're probably not going to be ready for many more breaches of reality , in which case you better stop watching the movie . So this ocean liner , hundreds of years ahead of its time ( if it will ever have its time ) , zooms through the ocean ' like a sword , ' and we are later forced to watch as an escape pod , probably 75-100 feet across , pops out of the side of it and starts zooming away on its side , propelled by hundreds of huge blades that ring its circumference . Clearly , much of the technology in this film was produced by the same mysterious company ( and with the same intentions of distracting your attention away from the astronomical liberties taken by the films ) that must have been operating in the late 1800s and that made the 80 foot tarantula that we saw in Wild Wild West . So if there's an ocean liner like this in the movie , obviously no one will complain that a futuristic car is able to zoom through the streets in Venice ( note : there are no streets in Venice , as in many other major European cities which were also primarily built before cars existed ) . At least it's not amphibious like the ocean liner / submarine . Okay , sorry . I told you I wouldn't go on about the ship . I'll stop . The thing that really bothered me about this movie , besides the inability to apply even the slightest amount of logic to it , is that it is a Hollywood film that seems to deliver to the world the idea that the mainstream American audience would get a big kick out of watching the massive destruction of European cities that are many times older the nation of America itself . I liked that some band of villains start off by inflicting massive damage with this gigantic tank and robbing banks with it and whatnot in order to turn countries in Europe against each other ( since they each think the other is responsible ) , eventually driving all of Europe to the brink of continent-wide war . A fantastic movie could have been made with this premise . But then you have the entry of all of these characters from old movies and , mostly , classic literature , such as the invisible man , a vampire , the man who can't be killed ( not sure exactly where he comes from ) , Captain Nemo , Dr . Jekyll / Mr . Hyde ( the latter of which is magnified to almost the same cartoonish scale as the Hulk ) , etc . Sure , it was fun to see updated versions of these old characters . As Stephen King would say , people love to see characters from other stories return . It's almost like seeing family again .

The philosophical underpinnings of this film were also worth contemplating . Do we have a world without violence by all becoming dittoheads , or do we have conflict and remain human ?

Like Dawn of the Dead seeing a possible attack on consumerism , this has a similar feel , anyone with a camcorder , writing a blog or texting their experiences is "" infected "" , telling their version of the "" truth "" . Of course , you can ignore this idea and concentrate on the action itself , there is plenty of innovative splatter and visceral excitement to keep fans happy , all captured in documentary style filming . Starring Joshua Close as Jason Creed , Philip Riccio as Ridley Wilmott , Michelle Morgan as Debra Moynihan , Shawn Roberts as Tony Ravello , Amy Ciupak Lalonde as Tracy Thurman , Joe Dinicol as Eliot Stone , Scott Wentworth as Andrew Maxwell , Chris Violette as Gordo Thorsen , Tatiana Maslany as Mary Dexter , a cameo by Romero as Police Chief Arthur Katzand the voices of Wes Craven , Stephen King , Simon Pegg , Quentin Tarantino and Guillermo del Toro , all as Newsreaders . In comparison to the original trilogy , this is a perfect addition to the series , much better than the previous instalment , I would love to see another as good as this one . Very good !


Text2: bought back memories of those Monday night games This has got to be John Turturro's best role so far . He was actually believable as Cosell . It shows how Cosell made Monday Night football as much as everyone hated him . I remember some of those games and comments . He was always a guy full of surprise comments and an articulate verbal arsenal . They made Frank Gifford look really stupid in this movie . I also think they made a big mistake when they did not resign Cosell . They left out the famous speech between Cosell and Meredith . This is a must see for any Monday Night football fan .

545,"Text1: Not the second season , but not bad After the disappointment of the third season , I was hoping for some improvement . . . that's what I got , no doubt about it , but the question is ' how much ' . Bringing back McInnerny and Fry was definitely a good idea , both are great additions to the cast , and both play different characters than before so it doesn't feel too reminiscent . . . any new show should offer new things . Keeping Laurie , and with him , the boisterous , loud-mouthed , slang-ridden personality that he brings . . . I'm not sure that was that great of an idea . I have no problem with the man , but the type of character he plays here and in the third season , I don't really care much for . He just doesn't really add anything worthwhile . Something that surprised me was how many gross-out , low-brow jokes they threw in this time around . . . I mean , sure , a few of the Baldrick ' lower than low ' jokes were like that in the two previous seasons , but this is preposterous . Why put something like that into the mix ? It only detracts from the verbal comedy and satire . Something , however , that was a positive thing , was that they ( almost , with maybe one or two exceptions ) completely avoided the see-through plots this time around . There were times were I was certain that I could tell what would happen , and the show would take me by surprise . "" Bob "" returns , though , unfortunately , with him ( or rather , her ) , Flasheart . Why is that character so popular ? I , personally , could do without him completely . Miranda Richardson returns yet again . . . rather good , as usual . While Blackadder was bitter this time around , he wasn't depressingly so , as in the third season . He was biting and satirical , as in the second season as well as the two specials , which is definitely the best type for the character . . . it should , however , be noted , that he is still more bitter than he were in those efforts . The plots are interesting and well-written . The episodes are mostly good ; apart from the last one , none of them really disappointed me , and even that one was rather good . The acting is all good . The humor has perfect timing and all of the top ( as they all are ) players are right on their marks . Almost all of this is clever , witty and biting , though there is some silly humor left over from last season ( by , for example , Laurie ) . Still , a must-see for any BlackAdder fan . I recommend it to any fan of Atkinson , any of the other comedians and / or British humor , as well as obviously anyone even remotely amused by the other BlackAdder installations .


Text2: Well , if you take it for what it is , you'll definitely be entertained There are more than enough reasons this movie should suck : it's directed by a music video director , whose done no other movies so far , not even for TV or direct-to-video . It's based on a comic book , and from the looks of it , only vaguely based on it ( despite the original comic being at least seemingly highly popular ) . It's got religious undertones , making it seem heavy-handed and / or ridiculous to many viewers . Yes , there are an awful lot of very good reasons this movie should suck . . . but it doesn't . It just requires you to suspend disbelief and take the movie for what it is . . . the story of an anti-hero battling demons and keeping the balance between good and evil . Nothing more . A fairly by-the-numbers save-the-world scenario with Keanu Reeves playing off his Neo role , killing evil creatures , usually with ease . The plot is pretty good , though at times , it's unnecessarily confusing . The pacing is pretty good , the film isn't too long for it's own good and you're fairly rarely bored . The effects are the definite high point in the film , looking exceptionally well . The action is somewhat seldom in the film , and it's mostly very quickly over with . . . but it looks damn good , and it's usually intense and involving . The biggest problem with the action is that Constantine says he has fought the half-breeds all his life . . . yet he has an easy time of killing the actual demons as well . The acting is pretty good , with few exceptions . The dialog is well-written at times , and there are some great one-liners . The great thing about the tone is that there's all these undead and demonic creatures he has to fight . . . so he uses holy weaponry . A Holy Shotgun , holy brass knuckles . . . good stuff . One of my biggest problems is the entire motivation of the ' bad guys ' though . We never understand why these people ( uh , creatures ) do as they do . Apart from the few shortcomings , the film is quite entertaining , and surely worth the rental . I recommend this to any fan of this kind of movie ( bloody action with there ' hero ' saving the world ) and possibly some fans of the original comic as well ( just be prepared for a lot of unwanted changes from the source material ) .

546,"Text1: Maybe , Just Okay ! Long before Hugh Laurie OBE and Joely Richardson became known for their roles on American dramas like House and Nip / Tuck , they were already established and well-known in their native Britain as top professional performers . In this film , Ben Elton directs them with a first rate cast but the script needs some work and it has an ending that I was not too crazy about it . Of course , the setting is in London and the supporting cast is first rate with friends like Rowan Atkinson , Joanna Lumley OBE , Dawn French , Adrian Lester , and of course Emma Thompson . This film is a great comedy and drama at the same time but it is also quite believable too . I love the London locations and miss going there .


Text2: What a mistake ! Sadly , the third movie in the X-Men series doesn't come close to living up to either its potential or the precedent established by the first two movies . But before I get to that , I'll cover a couple aspects of the film that really worked for me . First , the action sequences are generally well done . As individual set pieces , the action scenes work . Second , when I first heard that Kelsey Grammar was brought on board to play the Beast in X-Men : The Last Stand , I was a little apprehensive . I mean the thought of Frasier Crane doesn't exactly conjure images of an action hero . After seeing the film , I cannot imagine anyone else in the role . Grammar is the center of attention in every scene in which he appears ? and it's not just the makeup . On to the problems : I can sum up most of the issues I have with X-Men : The Last Stand in two words ? Brett Ratner . The decision to allow Ratner to direct X-Men : The Last Stand was a total mistake . Ratner seems to think that throwing together action sequences and CGI effects is all you need to make a good movie . Sorry Mr . Ratner , but the first two films were much more than this . The script and direction feel rushed and sloppy with little thought given to what made the series so good to begin with . There is no character development . Mutants are thrown on screen with the sole purpose of showing off special effects ? not in an attempt to create memorable characters . And the characters from the previous two movies are handled poorly . Jean Grey's conversion to the Phoenix isn't explained at all . And she does nothing for most of the movie other than standing around looking like a reject from an army of the undead . Cyclops , a major character from the other movies , is killed off with no fanfare . And his death occurs off-screen ! Why ? Rogue is totally unnecessary . None of her scenes have anything to do with the plot other than adding some unneeded WB style melodrama . Professor Xavier and Mystique ? gone far too quickly . And Wolverine has been reduced to little more than an Arnold Schwarzenegger wannabe spouting one-liners like he's working at the local comedy club . I could go on and on , but you get the idea . In short , it's a disaster .

Cleavon Little , Gene Wilder , and Slim Pickens try their damndest to make it work , but they have no material to work with whatsoever . Some of the racial comedy might have worked back when Richard Pryor first started his career , but it's all hopelessly dated in 2002 .

The gorgeous model Suzy Parker , who had been getting film roles since the ' 50s but wasn't much of an actress , plays Robertson's love interest . Since by 1962 there was no studio system to bring these actors along , most of them wound up having careers in television and were a big part of my growing up years . Very much a soap opera , "" The Interns "" today seems overdone and not particularly well acted . The plot deals with mercy killing , abortion , sexism and Dexedrine ; it focuses on three doctors : Michael Callan , a user who is romancing two women , one with money ( Anne Helm ) and one so he can get a residency with her old boss ; James MacArthur , a straight arrow who falls in love with a nurse with a yen for travel ( Stefanie Powers ) ; and Cliff Robertson , an older intern who tries to help his model girlfriend ( Parker ) terminate a pregnancy . Nick Adams plays a buffoon who falls in love with a terminally ill patient ( Ellen Davalos ) . It's hard to give an opinion on this film in 2008 , after such excellent TV shows as "" Saint Elsewhere "" and "" ER "" - in the beginning of the movie , a woman dies , and James MacArthur has to pry her hand from his arm . Anyone who's ever read or seen a mystery or watched a medical show knows rigor doesn't set in that fast .

If you remember in the film Rod Steiger has the murder of a rich northern industrialist on his hands and reluctantly uses the expertise of visiting homicide detective Sidney Poitier to solve the murder . Now years later , Virgil Tibbs formerly of the Philadelphia PD Homicide Squad and now played by Howard E . Rollins , Jr . has responded to an offer from Chief Gillespie . Gillespie is now Carroll O'Connor and has made a place for Tibbs on the Sparta , PD as a newly made detective . Rollins IS the Detective Division of the Sparta , PD . Because this show clicked so well these characters were fully developed over the seven year run of the series . We got to know everybody in the small town of Sparta , Mississippi and even the most minute characters were three dimensional , the writing on this show was so good . O'Connor alluded to his racist past and we saw a man in Chief Gillespie who was a work in progress . In the end he fell in love with black city council member Denise Nicholas . Rollins had to adjust too , things don't quite work the same way in Sparta , Mississippi as they do in Philadelphia . And I'm not speaking necessarily of racial attitudes . Alan Autry played Bubba Skinner and he was something of a prot√©g√© of O'Connor's and he thought he ought to have been the detective . He was not a stupid guy either by any means . He and Rollins gradually developed a working relationship over the course of the show . Gunsmoke was the first show to put the main characters within the context of the town they lived in . Beyond James Arness and the other principal cast members , Dodge City had a nice group of recurring regular citizens . That was nothing though like Sparta , Mississippi . Watching In The Heat Of The Night was like taking residence in that town for an hour each week . In The Heat Of The Night was television series at its best , sad that it came to an end because of the health and other problems of its two lead cast members . It could still be running today .

553,"Text1: Town On Trial The element of the burnt-out case who discards the bottle to pursue justice was used much later by Paul Newman in The Verdict but Raimu got there first in this excellent movie which may be Henri Decoin's finest hour . There's a fantastic opening which establishes the provincial town and manages to convey the feeling of a rotten centre ; the rain-lashed streets and glistening cobblestones are the very essence of noir and it could be argued ( but not by me ) that Decoin lingers a tad too long on something that will not be seen again given that the bulk of the film is set in Raimu's large , decaying mansion and / or the courtroom where Decoin shows he's been influenced by Welles by including the ceilings in the frame . Raimu was rarely seen as a full-scale urbanite ( at least I've never seen him in a role that calls for collar , tie and suit ) but shows he's just as effective as a white-collar worker than a peasant / tradesman . His response to his wife's departure is to remarry immediately taking as his bride the bottle and is measuring his life with Claret when death comes to call in the shape of a stiff he finds in one of the rooms . His daughter runs with a pretty fast crowd and in nothing flat her boyfriend is tapped for the killer and despite any discernible paternal feeling Raimu takes the case and in proving the boyfriend's innocence accuses the whole town , fabric of society etc of being culpable . Like so many movies before and after the source material is a novel by Georges Simenon but the standout adaptation is the work of Henri-Georges Clouzot , on the verge of making his own mark as a first-rate director with a trio of Classics in Le Corbeau , La Salaire de la puer and Les Diaboliques to his name .

Text2: Translation : It'll Kill A Couple Of Hours I was intrigued to see , in the pre-credit sequence , Yvan Attal , well-known in France as a triple-threat ( writer-director-actor ) but barely a blip on International radar screens , and figured with him on board this might be better than I figured . Alas ! Attal wound up with about seven or eight minutes of screen time and Sydney Pollack declined an acting credit which pretty well sums things up , in fact I'm writing this immediately after the screening before I forget it completely . Apart from her questionable choice to appear in that cinematic joke Moulin Rouge I don't have much against Nicole Kidman , she's more than passable eye-candy and not above turning in a fairly competent acting job from time to time but when you keep noticing her wayward accent you know that her acting isn't up to making you forget it . As thrillers go it's in trouble from the start by implying that you can wander around the UN Building after hours at will . Kidman at least had an excuse , flimsy though it was but what about the conspirators who just happened to choose the very moment that Kidman was there to whisper aloud their plans to assassinate a delegate ; how did THEY get in there after hours ? When questions like these raise their logical heads in the first few minutes then credibility goes right out the window and all you have left is the location and the acting . The undemanding will love it - don't take my word , just read most of the previous comments . I find it mildly amusing that many of these came from Greece given that the movie was Greek to me .

Now it's gone out of print in the US and another import version ( Chinese or Japanese ) is available in NTSC format , and it's fine if you don't mind somewhat literal subtitles , obviously written by someone that does not speak English as a first language , but that was relatively minor . On to the film : A widower is told by his young son that he's looking old , and a friend of his talks him into staging a fake audition for the purpose of meeting a suitable young bride . Aoyama can sure pick ' em , he is smitten with Asami before he ever sees her in person and seems to fall in love when he actually talks to her , and they go out a few times to dinner and such . There's something not quite right about Asami though , nobody seems to know anything about her and her stories don't check out . Does that stop Aoyama though ? No , it doesn't . In further poking around into her background he finds some quite disturbing information that may or may not be connected with her . And poor little Asami just sits around in her room waiting for the phone to ring with a duffel bag with dubious contents sitting nearby . Oh my . This is sort of a journey into David Lynch territory , but generally his films aren't quite this grisly .

Text2: Were those two babies drinking Mai-tais ? This film ( which I saw on Saturday ) has been trashed by the critics - including several on this thread . Why it has been is beyond me . The purpose of the film was to entertain the public during the summer , and it succeeds at that . But for some unknown reason it doesn't have the weight and gravity a lot of people expect from films these days . As this is summertime I can only wonder why we need more "" solid "" pictures . The news from the Mideast and the effects of global warming are serious enough to suit me . Robin Williams is Rev . Frank , a basically liberal and understanding minister who does try to keep his flock towing the ethics line given in the Bible . Among that flock is the Jones family , who have been ardent fans of his work ( and for his parish - one of them helped in the building of the church ) for three generations . The oldest daughter , Sadie ( Mandy Moore ) , has just gotten a proposal from her live-in lover Ben ( John Kasinski ) before the entire family at her parents ' ( Peter Strauss , Roxanne Hart ) thirtieth wedding anniversary party . She accepts , but they also have to see Rev . Frank . It seems Sadie wants to get married at the Reverend's church . The Reverend is willing to perform the wedding , but he insists that they have to go through a "" course "" in marriage and it's responsibilities and duties before he'll perform it . As the wedding is set for three weeks this means cramming a three month or more course into that small period of time . And the course is not as easy as Ben would hope . Rev . Frank believes in the sacredness and sanctity of marriage , which means the couple have got to be aware of just what they are about to entangle themselves and each other into . So first off - no sex until after the wedding from now on . The idea is to concentrate of the emotional / intellectual bonds of the couple , not their desire to play together . Secondly , they have to explore what each really fully thinks ( and accepts ) about the other . They both have failings ( Sadie has a high opinion of her organizational abilities , and Ben tends to let things slide a bit ) . They both have to see what child care will be like ( possibly the most interesting part of the film - Ben and Sadie are handed a pair of mechanical twin babies to care for . . . with less than successful results ) . Ben's opinion about Sadie's family and friends has to be revealed ( as their real feelings about him ) . The course takes a toll on both participants , to the point that Ben is frustrated , angry , and looking for a way out . It turns out that there was a bugging device installed by Rev . Frank and his juvenile assistant ( Josh Flitter in a nice performance as a minister-in-training ; One hopes that he appears in more films , and does another turn with Williams whom he works well with - they play off each other easily ) in Ben and Sadie's apartment . Ben tells his friend / best man Joel ( DeRay Davis ) about this , and Joel recommends finding out what they can on Rev . Frank for leverage purposes against him .

557,"Text1: The Tall corpse-snatcher returns . . . Gory good fun ! ! Morbidity is all around in this ultra-violent , belated sequel ( almost 10 years ) to Phantasm . The film almost takes entirely place in graveyards , mortuaries , abandoned ghost-towns and filthy vaults ? something that'll certainly attract gore-lovers and other sick puppies like myself ? ; ) To my regret , I must say I never saw the original Phantasm so maybe I'm missing out on yet a whole lot more ? One thing I can already say with certainty : Phantasm is a very ingenious franchise with a solid horror villain ( The Tall Guy ) and inventive slashing methods . Number two mainly seems to handle about the hunt and ( hopefully ) eternal destroying of the Tall Man by Mike and Reggie . Mike spent seven years in an institution after witnessing the Tall Man's first adventure and Reggie is an ex-ice cream vendor ( which gives you more or less an idea of the oppressed , dry humor in Phantasm ) . Agnus Scrimm in the shape of the Tall Man cheerfully continues to rob entire cemeteries and transforms the bodies into ugly dwarfs , while the heroes arm themselves with complete toolboxes and other home-made artillery that seem to come right out an episode of ' The A-Team ' . Absolute highlights in this light-headed , gory bunch are the spirited weapons in the form of metal spheres ? The plant themselves into the forehead of the victim and drill their way further into the brain . Very gruesomely yummy ! ! By the way ? it's also a very educational film if you're interested in learning about the principles and practices of embalming ? you never know , right ? ? Negative elements are the complete lack of tension and the dreadful love-story between Mike and the girl he communicates with through dreams . Bring out the beer and enjoy the bloodshed !


Text2: The things you own ends up owning you . What's fascinating in David Fincher's work , is that it seems we deal with an auteur . He created his own universe , a nocturnal and filthy one , and a bit misogynous too : it's glaring in this movie ; outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk - , only a black woman has a line to say . Almost everywhere , it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings . This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors : of course "" Dr Jekill and Mister Hide "" to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant , "" a clockwork orange "" , "" rebel without a cause "" "" bad influence "" and Joel Schumacher's "" falling down "" , the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated . So why does this movie seem so original ? it owes a lot to E . Norton ( more than Pitt ) who had already overshadowed R . Gere in "" primal fear "" . Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom : watching mental suffering ( therapy groups , dealing almost essentially with male problems ) , then physical sufferings , eventually enduring them . Does he do that as he would opt for yoga , Buddhism or psychotherapy , to escape from a routine work ? To get free from the material world ? As Pitt says "" the things you . . . "" The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free . At first , he may be , when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor - , but , he's potentially a Stevensonian hero . There's a big coup de theatre in this movie , a breathtaking and unexpected twist , √† la "" sixth sense "" , "" Jacob's ladder "" or "" Usual suspects "" , and it's difficult to comment this movie : all you say is questioned when you KNOW . Of course I won't reveal it , but I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie . Unlike the three mentioned works , this does not seem logical , because of the lack of "" clues "" : the only one , regarding Bonham-Carter , is not really convincing . The last picture seems now terrifying .

There are large breasts galore , covered and not , plenty of sex , some pretty disgusting gore , and even a "" homeboy "" garage mechanic ( as played by director Yudis ) who is obviously confused about more than just his race . James is a young man on his way to visit his father ( Hezekiah ) in Desert Range , a very isolated area in the desert , and finds when he arrives that Dad has a new main squeeze in Cheryl , who is definitely busting out all over .

There's also some little thing , a rat maybe , that is scurrying around out of sight , and I won't spoil that for anyone interested in seeing this by providing any further details . I was rather surprised to find out what this critter was myself but it also dragged the movie down a notch for me . Up to a point this is raunchy and unspoiled fun , but while it was fairly clever too , up to a point , it unfortunately ventured into "" stupid "" territory . I will give a big hand to the creators of this film for their efforts and their obvious affection for film-styles of old ( like late 60's / early 70's ) but there were just a couple things that dragged this down for me and lessened my enjoyment of this . Not a bad effort though , and I'm sure some will like it more than others . .


Text2: let's get one thing straight here What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film ? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories ? You'd think so by some of the reviews . Al Adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy , not much more , so if you go into them knowing that already it helps , and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value , especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value . First off , this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits , so you know things are looking promising . This is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body , the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital . Of course Nurse Sherri tends to his needs and all , and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her . And Nurse Sherri begins to change . No longer the nice nurse , she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects . There's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of Sherri's co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo . This is not bad if you're a cult film fan , but it may be bad if you're a "" Spiderman "" fan because you won't like it . At times this actually lurches towards "" respectability "" ( for Adamson , anyway ) but then it "" unredeems : itself with some ridiculous event . If you enjoy Adamson's films and similar trash you may well like this , for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure , keep digging . .

559,"Text1: odd film "" Party Girl "" is a B film in A wrapping paper - even the title suggests a tawdry B picture . But it's in color and stars Robert Taylor , Cyd Charisse , Lee J . Cobb , and John Ireland . Taylor plays an attorney whose hip was damaged in a boyhood accident . He's become a powerful mob mouthpiece when he falls in love with a showgirl ( Charisse ) . When he wants out of the mob life , he finds that the mobster ( Cobb ) is unwilling to let him go . Directed by Nicholas Ray , the film flirts more with film noir than B status and has some excellent performances , particularly by Taylor and Lee J . Cobb . Cobb is quite terrifying as a violent thug who doesn't telegraph his violence , making him all the more frightening - you just never know what he's going to do . And the violence doesn't leave much to the imagination . Taylor does a terrific job as an attorney who all his life has believed he's nothing but a cripple , an outsider , and has given up on having any kind of a personal life . He tells Charisse the story of how his hip came to be damaged in his youth and talks about it being a mark of bravery - until he was older and the other guys were getting the dates . I really can't see any woman looking at Robert Taylor being deterred by a limp - or anything else - but perhaps this is more a statement about the power of a negative self image and how it allowed him to be ridiculed by his wife . Charisse is very good and has two great dance numbers that show off her great talent , gorgeous figure , and those to-die-for legs . The script has some huge problems . The story is preposterous , the Swedish surgery being one aspect that defies reality . The other is the DA expecting a lawyer to breach attorney-client privilege . Also , the film is set in the ' 30s but some of it has a ' 50s aura to it - I blame the color more than anything else . "" Party Girl "" is still worth seeing . It's a Nicholas Ray film , it's Taylor's last MGM film as a contract player , and he turns in a wonderful performance .


Text2: cute comedy David Niven is an isolated concert pianist who is swept into the lives of apartment house residents in "" A Kiss in the Dark , "" also starring Jane Wyman . Niven is excellent as a man who knows no other world than that of the concert stage and the practice room , and his handlers like it that way . When an apartment manager visits him , Niven learns that one of his investments is The Cleopatra Apartments . One look at Jane Wyman in her shorts and Niven decides not to be an absentee landlord . This is a very entertaining comedy , and I agree with previous posters that there are laugh out loud scenes . Some of the comedy is provided by , of all people , Broderick Crawford as a subletter who works at night and sleeps - - or tries to - - all day . It's a different role for Crawford , and he does it very well . Wyman is very pretty and vivacious as an apartment dweller who falls for Niven , and the two have wonderful chemistry . Handsome Wayne Morris is her insurance salesman boyfriend . This isn't the most fabulous film you'll ever see , but it's a fun one .

Text2: "" You Can Do Just About Anything You Want To , Chance . "" Howard Hawks initially wanted to reunite John Wayne and Montgomery Clift who had worked so well together in Red River in his second film with Wayne . Clift however was at the beginning of the slide that would ultimately destroy him in seven years and said no . It was then that Dean Martin was cast as John Wayne's alcoholic deputy . By the way if Clift had done the part it would have reunited him with Walter Brennan also who is playing a very similar part to the one he did in Red River in relation to Wayne . In the wordless beginning of Rio Bravo , Wayne while going into the town saloon to fetch Dino , witnesses a cold blooded killing perpetrated by Claude Akins . Akins is the no good brother of rich rancher John Russell who keeps trying to spring Akins from Wayne's jail . He also brings in some hired guns who bottle the town up . Both Howard Hawks and John Wayne absolutely hated High Noon and made Rio Bravo as their answer to it . This sheriff doesn't go around begging for help from the townspeople he's sworn to protect . He's supposed to be good enough to handle the job himself with some help from only a few good men . Dean Martin said that the Rio Bravo role for him was one of the most difficult . At that time he was playing a drunk on stage and was not yet into the substance abuse problems that beset him later on . But turns in a stellar performance . This film marked the farewell feature film performance of Ward Bond who took some time from his Wagon Train TV series to play the small role of a Wayne friend who offers to help and gets killed for his trouble . Fitting it should be in the starring film of his best friend John Wayne . The only bad note in Rio Bravo is that of Ricky Nelson who is too much the nice kid from Ozzie and Harriet to suggest being a young gun . But Rio Bravo marked the first of many films Wayne used a current teenage idol to insure box office . Later on Frankie Avalon , Fabian , Bobby Vinton all the way down to Ron Howard in The Shootist brought a younger audience in for the Duke . James Caan who played the Ricky Nelson part in El Dorado was much superior to Nelson . Then again , Caan is an actor . But I will say that Dean and Ricky sung real pretty . When you hear Dean singing My Rifle , Pony , and Me in the jailhouse , you might recognize the same melody from Red River as Settle Down . Dimitri Tiomkin wrote it and Dean recorded it as well as the title song for Capitol records . At Capitol Dino did mostly ersatz Italian ballads , it was what he was identified with . When he switched to Reprise , Dino started doing far more country and western and it really starts with the songs he did in Rio Bravo . Rio Bravo is a leisurely paced western , probably one of the slowest John Wayne ever did . But Howard Hawks created some characters and a story that hold the interest through out .

Noticing Jimmy's dead butterfly collection ( he kills them by means of a jar he calls a ' killing bottle ' ) , an evil idea forms in Rollo's mind . He invites Jimmy to stay at his wealthy brother Randolph's country house . Randolph is somewhat unbalanced . He will kill anyone - or anything - he knows has been cruel to living things . Rollo is gambling on Randolph losing his mind on seeing Jimmy demonstrating the killing bottle . With him put away for life , the estate will be entirely his . . . Based on a story by L . P . Hartley , this tale of murder , madness , and greed is pretty offbeat . It never occurs to Randolph that murder is in itself an act of cruelty . The ending - in which Rollo has a change of heart following a hastily blurted-out ultimatum from his girlfriend - is rather unconvincing . As I have not read the original short story , I do not know if Julian Bond was faithful to it or not . There's no American guest-star in this episode . Roddy McDowall was familiar enough across the Atlantic ( in films such as ' Planet Of The Apes ' ) to take the lead here , while future ' Doctor In The House ' star Barry Evans plays the naive ' Jimmy ' . William Marlowe steals the show as the deranged ' Randolph ' , a man outwardly normal until he sees cruelty displayed towards animals or even insects . The scene in which Jimmy puts the butterfly in the killing bottle as the others look on is disturbing even now .


Text2: A Nutshell Review : Ip Man I shall now proclaim unabashedly that I absolutely love this movie ! It's been some time since we last saw a biopic on one of the Chinese's martial arts folk heroes , with Jet Li's Fearless being the last memorable one to hit the big screen . While Li lays claim to three of such roles in the iconic Wong Fei Hung ( in the Tsui Hark movies ) , Fong Sai Yuk and Huo Yuan Jia in Fearless , after which he felt he had to hang up his martial arts roles because he thought that he had communicated all that he wanted about martial arts through these films . And thank goodness for Donnie Yen still being around to pick up from where the genre left off , and presenting a memorable role which he truly owned , with Ip Man being the first cinematic rendition of the Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster . In this bio-pic , Ip Man , one of the earliest Wing Chun martial arts exponents credited to have propagated its popularity , gets portrayed as the best of the best in 1930s Fo Shan , China , where the bustling city has its own Martial Arts Street where countless of martial arts schools have set up shop to fuel the craze of kung fu training . With each new school , the master will pay their respects to Ip Man and to challenge him to a duel . Ip Man , an aristocrat who spends most of his quality time developing and perfecting his brand of martial arts , will take them on behind closed doors , so as not to damage his opponents ' reputation nor embarrass them in public . His humility is his virtue , and his style is never violent or aggressive , which often gets assumed and mistaken for being effeminate , since Wing Chun after all was founded by a woman . The bulk of the story gets set in the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war , and it's not all fight and no story . Witth this historical setting , at times it does seem that there is an air of familiarity with the type of stories told , with how the Japanese Imperial Army had made life really miserable for the Chinese , and how the Chinese being fragmented in spirit , fail to unite during dire straits . More often than note , martial arts become a unifying force , and this aspect of the narrative might seem to be a walk in the usual territory . But with its array of charismatic supporting cast with the likes of Simon Yam as Ip Man's best friend and industrialist Quan , and Lam Ka Tung as a cop turned translator , there are little nicely put sub plots which seek to expand the air of respect that Ip Man commands amongst his community . The story by Edmond Wong did not demonize all the villains , often adding a dash of empathy and sympathy to the likes of the Japanese General Miura ( Hiroyuki Ikeuchi ) , a highly skilled exponent from the North called Zhao ( Fan Siu Wong ) as well as Lam's translator character who is deemed as a traitor for being in the service of the Japanese . Ip Man the family man also gets put under the spotlight , where his passion could sometimes leave him neglecting his wife and kid , and through the course of the story this focus often leaves one quite exasperated for his family's safety as he puts his countrymen above self and family when going up against the oppressive Japanese forces . So what's the verdict on the action ? Action junkies won't have to wait too long before watching Ip Man in action , and to Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu Hung's credit , they have intricately designed some of the most varied martial arts sequences in the movie , such as private fights in his home , a factory m√™l√©e , a Japanese dojo battle as seen in the trailer , ( which I know has actually sent some positive vibes amongst moviegoers , mouth agape at that incredible scene of Yen continuously beating down a karateka ) being somewhat of a throwback and reminiscent of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury , and a ringside duel amongst others . And it's not just Ip Man who gets in on the action , but specialized martial arts moves designed for the various practitioners as well . It's so difficult to name any particular one as a personal favorite , though I must add that you definitely won't feel short changed by the time the inevitable","{""output"": ""NO""}"
562,"Text1: High Tech Voyeurism Enhances a Good Thriller DISTURBIA is a fine little thriller of a movie . Though some viewers are commenting that it is merely a takeoff on REAR WINDOW and finding it not up to that caliber - and if that bothers potential viewers then be advised , for this viewer it is more a film that addresses our progressive invasion of privacy by high tech instruments , and as such the film makes an important statement . Writers Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth have produced a solid script that manages to capture teenage angst and view of the world and with director D . J . Caruso the story is propelled along with a hold-your-breath pace that makes for a very entertaining and scary movie ! Kale ( a very fine Shia LaBeouf ) had a great relationship with his father ( Matt Craven ) , but in a hideous auto accident Kale witnesses the death of his father , an event that disturbs him so greatly even a year later that he misbehaves in school and eventually is put under house arrest wearing an alarm bracelet on his ankle . Kale's mother ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) tries to cope with the ' incarcerated ' Kale , but tires of his aimless wasting of time and energy . Out of boredom Kale stares out his windows with binoculars , observing the neighbors , not the least of which is an attractive young Ashley ( Sarah Roemer ) . Kale's best friend Ronnie ( a very promising Aaron Yoo ) is Kale's only contact with the outside world and when the two boys spy on Ashley in her swimming pool , they together find more sophisticated means of voyeurism . And , once Ashley visits Kale the three join in spying on a strange neighbor Mr . Turner ( David Morse ) , finding him similar to a media-described serial killer . From there the plot thickens and quickens as the threesome made dangerous discoveries and end up in an investigation of scary proportions . The final fifteen minutes of the film are a bit over-the-top , but the rest of the movie is so well done that the ending can be forgiven . There are some fine cameo roles by Viola Davis as the detective in charge of Kale's house arrest , Jose Pablo Cantillo as officer who is stuck with responding to Kale's multiple infringements of his house arrest , among others . Shia LaBeouf is young in his craft but demonstrates a fine screen presence and a lot of polish : he carries the movie well . This is not a major film ( though it did very well at the box office ! ) , but is a surefire entertainment ! Grady Harp

As ElviraVixen pointed out it's awful but will hold your interest for most of its running time . The plot itself revolves around Olivia Hendrix a rather sad and lonely middle aged woman who has only one son Tom and only one friend Mrs Jay and because of her sad loneliness she smothers young Tom too much while she listens to Mrs Jay too much . When Tom decides to leave the nest things start to head for a collision course The production values are somewhat poor and if it wasn't for some strong language you'd think this was yet another TVM but what makes it so watchable is the performances and Michael Angella's disturbingly seedy script . Granted it's rather awful but I did enjoy Mrs Jay ( Superbly played by Olympia Dukakis ) attempted seduction of Tom and the quite laughable dialogue : "" Fuchsia ? But I hate fuchsia "" and "" Do you think you can remember that you stupid bitch ? "" It might be a good idea to wear a diaper while watching this since you might just wet yourself laughing .

Text2: Fair Epic But Let Down By A Lack Of Narrative Drive I'm still trying to decide if NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRIA is a good film or a bad film . Truth be told it's a bit of both . Unfortunately I'm going to have a problem deciding if the bad overwhelms the good or vice versa . This is epic film making by Sam Spiegal , but is far from being the best movie he's produced . I had a problem with the script for BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI and I've got a problem with the one here . I know it's an epic film but overlong doesn't equal epic . For instance one of the characters suffers from haemophillia and this is mentioned in one point in the movie , but then it's mentioned 15 minutes later , then 15 after that , then again after another 22 minutes . Just mentioning the condition once would have been quite enough . We also see characters like Lenin , Stalin , Kerensky popping into the narrative and then disappearing without little rhyme or reason . It does become obvious by the end that their inclusion probably wasn't necessary and gives a feeling that when they do appear they are under written anyway . Rasputin especially suffers from this type of scripting and the whole movie would have worked much better if it solely concentrated on his relationship with the Tsar's wife instead of giving us a history lesson on the last two decades of Russian imperial history . If truth be told it's not very good history either There are good aspects to the movie , and the cast are probably the best one . Perhaps Spiegel wanted so many characters included because he wanted to cast the cream of British talent . We've got Olivier and Redgrave both knights of the British stage alongside Julian Glover , Harry Andrews and Jack Hawkins . What a cast and as you'd expect they give very good performances . But let's not forget the two best performances belong to two unknown actors called Michael Jayston and Tom Baker . It must have taken some courage casting these two actors in such prominent roles Jayston still occasionally appears in TV roles while Baker found world wide fame as DOCTOR WHO . And let's not forget that a few other unknown actors like Brian Cox and Ian Holm appear in cameos . A good film for those wanting a three hour epic or seeing a host of big name actors when they weren't house hold names in their own household , but not really a film for serious students of Russian history

565,"Text1: This One Won't Go Super Nova Another freebie , one of six given away last week with The Times . It's marginally less hard to take than some of the others and the story - man accused falsely of murder , goes on the run , meets a nubile girl who , for no reason whatsoever , decides to help him - was creaking even in 1937 yet even Mank would use it in Escape several years later . Like most of the stuff Hitch was churning out at this period it has its share of notable actors , in this case Mary Clare in a quasi sympathetic role , Basil Radford playing himself again and the two leads Derrick de Marney and Nova Pilbeam . As is often the case with Hitch it is shot through with improbabilities - the scene for instance where De Marney nonchalantly flips a wrapper through the window of the mill in which he and Pilbeam are hiding , at the EXACT moment that a local plod happens to glance in that direction , but the best moment of all is when we discover the real murderer ( about which we have been told nothing other than that he killed his wife ) playing drums in an orchestra in which everyone with the exception of the leader is working in ' blackface ' , with the burnt cork reaching only as far as the neck and the hands completely untouched . Okay , Hitch needed a gimmick to make it tough for the only witness to recognise the villain but this was ridiculous .


Text2: Best action film of the late 90s Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exciting it scorches when you watch it . Nic Cage ( in a typically bad performance ) is Cameron Poe , a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife . After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird . But this is no ordinary flight . On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus ' The Virus ' Grissom ( John Malkovich ) a men on death row for murder , robbery , kidnapping and extortion . Nathan ' Diamond Dog ' Jones ( Ving Rhames ) , a black militant inside for murder . Billy Bedlam ( Nick Chinlund ) , inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog . Pinball Parker ( Dave Chapelle ) , a pimp and drug-dealer . Swamp Thing ( MC Gainey ) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack . And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler ( Steve Buscemi ) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girls head as a hat . As you can tell , with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose . As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over , restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America . Poe , being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is , doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help . It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin ( John Cusack ) and the cavalry can get there . Easier said than done , as double-crosses , suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up . The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic , devastating climax upon another anarchic , devastating climax . At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation . Con Air is everything an action film should be . Steve Buscemi steals the whole show . His deadpan , bug-eyed and dare I say ' innocent ' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centrepiece of the whole film . The scene where he sings with a little girl ( and continues later on ) will either freak you out or steal your heart . And the ending is the best you could hope for . Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud , blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare . It's brilliant stuff and I suggest you hunt down the ( sadly incomplete ) score CD . And this really did deserve the Best Original Song award over that pansy Titanic one . Superior to both The Rock and Face / Off , Con Air is Nic Cage at his ( worst ) best as an action hero and Bruckheimer at his best as an action producer . See it , for the love of God , see it .

567,"Text1: Unusual Steve Martin comedy that just doesn't fully work out . The movie doesn't really have the usual typical sort of comedy you would expect from an ' 80's Steve Martin movie . It's humor is often more in its little things , or one word that is spoken in its dialog . The movie doesn't build up to its jokes like a normal comedy would do but often things just come out of nowhere . It doesn't make this movie as humor filled as you would perhaps expect but it does make the movie somewhat original and somehow also real pleasant . Too bad that the story is such a weak one . The story doesn't seem to have one clear focus and subplots are not handled well enough . This has as a result that some moments and even characters just don't work out properly for the movie . It makes the movie also really a weak one to watch at times . The love-story just was too weak and not well developed enough . Judith Ivey is also supposed to be in her mid-20's in this movie but instead looks closer to 40 , while Steve Martin also works around a bit too much without his shirt on . It are mainly small things such as these that also makes the movie irritating at parts as well as weak , simply since it doesn't work out all as well as obviously intended . This movie could had been a great homage to the lonely guy but instead its story is all over the place , jumping from the one thing to another . It doesn't really give a good or fair portrayal of the average lonely guy , who normally is shy and just not the way Steve Martin portrays it in this movie . Charles Grodin is perhaps way better but he's just only playing second violin in this movie . Still a pleasant enough little movie to watch but just no genre classic , since it has way too many weaknesses , mainly concerning its story .

Douglas is at career best form here and has never surpassed this triumph Duvall plays his role Cooley . but when he snaps , it really hits home . Schumacher proves that he was once a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood and makes the film flow very very smoothly and the editing is second to none . the film can sometimes fall into the western genre at times . like the man with no name , d - fens wanders anonymously from set piece to set piece laying down the law , like a lone gunman , before the climatic gun duel between the two leads at the end . this movie has aged very well and will be a film that will be remembered for some powerful roles a great anti hero and some never bettered roles . see it now .

Lost and alone , hiding from her ex-con husband , Ashley Judd spends her time in a run down motel working and partying . When she meets a shy withdrawn man who seems nice she ends up drawn into his world and the insanity that lives there , a world filled with tiny bugs . A wonderfully acted trip down the road to hell this is a movie that is a true horror film . There are no monsters or serial killers just a trip into the minds of two people who bond and feed off each other . Brutal and graphically violent at times , this is more disturbing for what it says about the need for people to belong and the willingness to believe in order to do so . She needs his kindness and he needs some one to believe him . Together they mesh perfectly in a yin and yang circle of destruction . Whats scary here is that as the film progresses we begin to go along with the idea of the existence of tiny bugs . We as outsiders know that the bugs don't exist , but we are sucked along with the characters as their mania is allowed to run rampant and as things go on we begin to believe , perhaps fleetingly that maybe there is something to the story . Its a frightening thought that anyone could lose themselves in a situation like this , but it happens every day , one need only look at the news to see people living in personal little hells . I was left disturbed for days after viewing this movie . Its not for most people , but those who want to be challenged on most levels should search this film out , it will rock your world .

569,"Text1: The first part of the famous Dollars Trilogy , and one of the best Westerns Sergio Leone made some of the best and most well-made Westerns in his career , and this one is no exception . It's the first part of his Dollars trilogy , and , in my opinion , superior to the second part , For a Few Dollars More . I can't say if I prefer it to the third part , The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , since it's been too long since I saw that , but I'll re-watch and review that one soon , and then I'll clarify my position on each of the films in the trilogy . The film is widely known as the first spaghetti-Western ; that isn't true , as far as I know . It's not the first spaghetti-Western , it's just the first that became internationally known . Not to say that that isn't an accomplishment for Leone too , though ; after the films release , everyone wanted to make spaghetti-Westerns . The plot is great ; it deals with The Man With No Name who arrives in a small town , finds out that it's run by two major families , and decides to make money by turning them against each other . It's not terribly fast-paced , but it's more interesting than the second movie , and less dragging than the third . The action is also great ; it might be slightly inferior to that of the third film , but only slightly . The score , and especially the theme , is inferior to that of the third film , but that's not to say that the theme or score of this film isn't good ; it's just not as good as the theme / score of the third film . The acting is good , and in some scenes , great . I didn't find all of the performances great , though , but none were entirely terrible . The characters were all credible and well-written , despite the fact that a few of them are ( or has since become ) Western cliches . All in all , a great spaghetti-Western , and a must-see for any fan of Clint Eastwood and / or Sergio Leone . I recommend it to fans of spaghetti-Westerns , Sergio Leone and / or Clint Eastwood .


Text2: A film as devoid of life as a victim of the title creature A rapper and a singer who think they can act and / or have any business acting join forces with several actors and a comedian and face a large snake . The film was put together for the sole purpose of putting said snake , the type of which is in the very title , on the screen , the justification for such is not . . . present , and the main reason for choosing to do such a film seems to be the fact that the effects could be achieved in 1997 ( and , looking back , heck , maybe even looking at it back then , the might have benefited from waiting some ) . Not all the effects are bad , though . The acting is largely poor . Voight sounds like Jean-Claude Van Damme , and at one point , he even pulls off a move that would have fit more if done by said "" actor "" . More or less everyone else is negligible . The writing is set up to make sure the snake can appear . The technical aspects aren't horrible , they're just not particularly impressive . Editing , camera-work and all is flat and uninspired . I suppose some males may be attracted to Lopez and Wuhrer . I'm not sure there particularly is anything for women in this , but hey , if you're a female and you dig the film , that's fine . This is essentially creature-horror for fans of B-movie cinema . I'm not sure anyone else will find anything particularly spell-binding herein . I recommend this to those who fall into the former group . Those wanting a proper portrayal of the reptile , as well as anyone expecting a solid performance from even the most dependable of the actors may want to consider if they wouldn't be better off skipping this one .

I've yet to truly dislike or find myself unable to see genuine value in what I've watched that he's helmed . They are all movies of questions , not answers , as he , himself , puts it . And they all deal with life and death , often among other philosophical subjects . This perhaps in a different way than the others . At its center is the following for us all to ponder : Is living a right , or an obligation ? No lectures , no dictating , nothing is claimed as fact , but rather stated , and it is up to the individual to decide where they stand . The deliberate , eased pacing , with some use of sudden , startling shifts in intensity that he has employed before is evident here , and it's a perfect fit . This is very well-directed and effective . It can be strong , but never tasteless . In his make-up , Bardem is almost unrecognizable , going by what I've gotten of a look at him outside of it , which , admittedly , is not much . The editing and cinematography are masterful . Not a single moment is off . The acting , as well as I can judge it , not yet speaking the language , is spot-on , throughout . Javier , especially , seems to lose himself entirely in the role , and comes off as believable . The characters are well-written and credible . There is a little humor , and it is good ( do note that among it is relatively dark jokes ) . As with the previous releases by the man I mentioned at the beginning of this review , this is not a mainstream , easy-to-take-in flick . If you are seeking entertainment ( I'm not passing judgment , I don't only go for this kind of piece ) , you will probably do better to go elsewhere . The DVD holds three deleted scenes that are well worth the time ( and they're also subbed , so that helps ) , and a behind-the-scenes featurette that I will write about on its specific page here on the site . I recommend this warmly and eagerly to any fan of true film , of drama and of the people involved in making this , Alejandro in particular .


Text2: Cute , entertaining and fun action-adventure platform game Video games didn't always have rich plot-lines , photo-realistic graphics , epic cinematics and budgets to match . . . however , in recent years , with the constantly expanding computer power , we players have come to expect quite a lot of the media . That is not to say that good games did not exist before bullet-time and multiple camera angles were implemented ; in fact , this very game is a mighty good example of that ( and by all respects a classic video-game ) . The plot is about as simple as can be ( without being insulting to the player's intelligence ) ; a superhero has to rescue a damsel in distress from a villain ( it just so happens that the hero ( Jazz , whom you play as ) and damsel ( Eva Earlong ) are rabbits . . . and the villain ( Devan Shell ) is a turtle ) . The very opening sequence , which in a tongue-in-cheek manner attributes the superpowers of the main character , Jazz Jackrabbit , to be a mix of those of Superman , Batman and . . . Wonder Woman ( ? ! ) , lets us know that there is no pretense or seriousness within this game . The description of how to play even says , quite literally , that all you need to do in the game is run , shoot and pick up items . This game had exactly what games had to have back then : it was hip , fun , fast . . . and just something to enjoy . The music is funky-sounding , hip and rock-y . . . whichever fits the current level the most . The sound is appropriately cartoon-y , fitting in with the mood . The humor is the same ( for example , Jazz pulls at least one Bugs Bunny move in a cinematic ) . Basically anyone can play this game . . . it has no violence or any material that is otherwise offensive , so children can play it with no problem , and it doesn't require anything other than quick fingers and good hand-to-eye coordination , which any action game requires , anyway . The story is easy enough to follow , too . The game-play is entertaining ; it's fairly simple , but the game still challenges you ( the four different difficulty settings help , as well ) . The graphics are quite good , and the dynamic camera and level of detail helps to ensure that it still holds up well . . . more than ten years after it was made . It's 2D , but there are elements of 3D . The animation is mostly very smooth and well-done . To get Eva back from the evil clutches of Devan , Jazz will have to travel to a number of planets where the terrorizing tortoise has left over his henchmen ( among many others , turtles . . . which grow increasingly more threatening ) . Each chapter of the game ( of which there are six main ones and three bonus ones ) features 2-3 planets , each with 2 levels , followed by a boss fight level . The levels consist of Jazz running , jumping and shooting his way past the enemies , grabbing items for points , collecting ammo and power-ups . The points help give the game re-playability , together with finding every item and killing every enemy in each level . While the main projectile of your gun ( named the LFG-2000 , in a cute nod to Doom ) is quite efficient on its own ( and has an unlimited ammo supply ) , you can , as just hinted , pick up other kinds of ammo for it ; these include one firing flames , one with dual missiles , grenades that bounce , and even dynamite . The power-ups include "" rapid fire "" upgrades , the standard invincibility , faster running and more . The boss enemies vary , but most are well-designed and cool ( and reasonably challenging , as well ) to fight . Each planet has its own theme , with matching music , enemies , and often even unique color scheme . This helps keep the game fresh . In addition to the power-ups and alternate ammo , you can also get rather interesting ( and might I add , very unusual ) things to aid you in your heroic quest ; a bird with firepower ( ! ) and a jet-board ( yeah ! ) . The first-mentioned flies with you and fires at enemies that you are","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: Billy Bob can win your heart ! I love Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa and the Bad News Bears remake to 2005 after a 29 years since the original film . The film has changed to modify today's world where computers rule the world which I said at 10 years old to an skeptical neighbor and where even a handicapped wheelchair-bound boy can play baseball . Thornton plays Buttermaker , the major league baseball player who turns coach rather than get a jail sentence . The mother of one his players is played by the divine Marcia Gay Harden . I think the kid from Bad Santa also has a role as does Greg Kinnear who plays a competitive coach . I love watching the kids learn the sport by killing insects since Buttermaker is an exterminator and they sponsored by a strip club . They start getting better in the beginning .

Colby buys mushroom from the drug dealer Brent ( Jason Williams ) and after sniffing cocaine with Richard , he prepares a cocktail with the dope . Richard , Tommy and Colby drink the mushroom and have a bad trip with tragic consequences . "" Trip Out "" is an amateurish movie with a good potential . The screenplay is interesting , following the individual actions along the day of Tommy , Richard , Colby and concludes showing the revenge of Brent against Colby . However , the relationship between Richard and Tommy should have been better developed to make more sense the tragic and violent conclusion . The acting is very reasonable considering that the cast is amateur ; the camera work in Tommy's block is confused , but works better in Richard and Colby modules ; the edition is probably the best in this movie , perfectly entwining the scenes and giving consistency to the story . Considering that this is a low-budget movie , written , directed and performed by a young and green cast , and the low price of the DVD ( US$ 4 . 00 ) , I liked it . I really enjoy finding this type of original and refreshing work , in my opinion better than many blockbusters . Title ( Brazil ) : "" Viagem Suicida "" ( "" Suicide Trip "" )

573,"Text1: A surprisingly solid mid-80's made-for-TV vehicular "" Death Wish "" variant When one thinks of the singularly raw , gritty and hard-hitting cinema of Abel Ferrara ( who's rough'n'tumble films include "" Driller Killer , "" "" Ms . 45 , "" and "" Bad Lieutenant "" ) , several scattered idiot box credits aren't the first thing to spring to mind . But back in the mid-80's the often fiercely indie and underground Ferrara briefly went mainstream and somehow wormed his way onto the boob tube , where he directed the "" Crime Story "" pilot , a few episodes of "" Miami Vice , "" and this fairly generic , yet miraculously rough-edged and compelling made-for-TV feature . Ken Wahl of "" Wiseguy "" TV show fame gives a somewhat stolid , but overall acceptable and engaging performance as an amiably zhlubby blue collar ordinary shmoe ace automobile mechanic whose younger brother gets killed by a drunk driver in a sinister black muscle car . Haunted by his bro's untimely death and angry as all hell , Wahl builds himself a lethal souped-up tow truck , hits the dark , hazy , perilous Los Angeles nocturnal streets looking for that spooky muscle car , and winds up becoming a self-appointed vigilante who takes out all those leering , unruly , bellicose , recklessly inebriated killers on wheels who pose a general threat to decent , law-abiding folks on the road with them . Naturally the cops want to nail Wahl real quick and the media turns him into a folk hero . Okay , so the plot is little more than a vehicular "" Death Wish "" variant crossed with "" Duel "" and the picture does suffer somewhat from unavoidable mild'n'middlebrow TV movie sanitizing ( the sporadic sappy pop-slop tunes mewling away on the soundtrack are especially irritating ) , but Ferrara's strong , sturdy and stylish direction certainly compensates for these minor flaws . As usual with Ferrara , he takes a provocative questioning stance with the obsessive , tormented protagonist , vigilantism is properly addressed as the knotty , nothing remotely simple or easy about it issue that it really is , James Lemmo's slick , polished , glittering neon-hued cinematography vividly depicts a luridly gleaming nighttime atmosphere , and the palpable evocation of the scary , forbidding and dangerous urban hellhole jungle setting positively seethes with a frightfully omnipresent menace . Moreover , there are fine supporting turns by Nancy Allen as a sweet radio talk show host , the always reliable Robert Culp as a hard-nosed detective , and Stan Shaw as Wahl's nice dude best buddy , David Frank supplies an effectively spare , shivery , jazz-flavored score , and the final showdown between Wahl and the muscle car delivers the pulse-pounding , heart-stopping , metal-mangling auto-to-auto stand-off goods . Sure , it's not exactly one of Ferrara's best-ever offerings , but this generally solid and satisfying item sure ain't no lemon , either .

It must be seen to be appreciated . At first I found the two separate soundtracks jarring , because the same person recorded them both . But gradually , I began to flow with the two distinct , yet equally interesting , narratives . The visual images correspond to one or the other narrative at different points . Compelling to watch . This clearly was a labor intensive project , as any form of stop-motion animation has to be . Think about how long it took to shoot just 60 seconds worth of film and realize this is nine minutes long ! Well worth tracking down , I saw this on Sundance Channel last night . Most highly recommended , but if your idea of animation begins and ends with Bugs Bunny or Speed Racer , you may not care for this at all .

The two marry , and the rest of the film deals with Duncan's fight for acceptance on the farm , where she faces a fierce opponent in her father-in-law ( David Torrence ) . The film is romantic , emotionally moving and utterly beautiful . Yes , it is a lot like Sunrise , but , heck , who wouldn't want a second Sunrise ? It's hardly a carbon copy , anyway , so it's like another wonderful gift . City Girl is a masterpiece , as well . I'm not the biggest fan of Murnau's German films , but his three surviving American films are probably the best proof of the sentiment that the silent cinema was at a miraculous level right when it was snuffed by sound . Murnau tragically died in an auto accident in 1931 . I find it hard to imagine his work in the talkies , but I have an inkling that the cinema would be rather different if he had survived .


Text2: Long and amorphous , but still interesting I definitely liked this film much better than Jia's Unknown Pleasures , his follow-up , but I still wouldn't call it great . Platform is a very amorphous film . Perhaps it has more meaning to those who might know the referents better than I , the various places in China which are visited . But the fact remains that the loose , repetitive , episodic structure mixed with the total lack of character development hinder much of the possible enjoyment or involvement . I know it's not cool for a certain sector of Chinese art films to allow the audience to give a crap what's going on . But , surprisingly , I did enjoy it to a fair extent . You kind of feel like you're part of the performance troupe in the film , that you're being carted between these sections of nowhere around the vast country . There are many beautiful scenes . It's worthwhile . I suggest , given its 2 . 5 hour running length , to watch it in bits and pieces . It won't feel quite as repetitive .

578,"Text1: Mr . Deeds , in my opinion , marks a point in Adam Sandler's career where it seems that the majority of the thinking audience will , if they haven't already , begin to wonder whether Sandler will ever do anything SPOILERS SPOILERS The new name for the character that Sandler plays in every movie is , in this case , Mr . Deeds , a small town man who learns that he is the inheritor of a massive fortune from a distant relative who is a media mogul . Deeds lives in the tiny town of Mandrake Falls , New Hampshire , where he is constantly the talk of the entire town , the borders of which do not seem to extend very far past the doors of the pizzeria that he owns . He comes to New York to see what all the financial fuss is about , and as all his friends at home watch him on TV , he proceeds to try to take part in the company rather than taking his inheritance and going back into obscurity where he clearly belongs . ( spoilers ) The fortune is , first of all , ridiculously exaggerated . There is no one in the target audience of this film ( nor , really , many people at all in the world ) who can really visualize how much money $40 billion exactly is . That's not even money , as James Caan said in The Way of the Gun ( where he speaks about $50 million , I believe ) , it's a new life . Money is what you get out of the ATM , it's what you take to the grocery store . $40 billion is so astronomical that they may as well have just said that Deeds has inherited all the money in the world . On the other hand , while I thought that the film had a positive message against greed and corruption , the fact that Deeds turned down the inheritance ( simply saying that he doesn't want that money ) could not have been more poorly executed . First of all , when he decides that he just doesn't want it , if you listen you can hear everyone in the audience slapping their foreheads almost as hard as when Mox pulled that ' oh-I-just-can't ' crap during the whipped cream bikini scene in Varsity Blues . Second , while it was nice to see that Deeds decides to donate the money to charity instead of accepting more money than any single human being could spend in 20 lifetimes with wide-eyed glee , this part of the film was probably the least creative thing in the entire movie , which wasn't very creative to begin with . I can imagine the writers of the movie writing this scene at the end of the day or right before their lunch hour , just because it's so obvious that it was slapped together . When Deeds asked the name of that one charity , you know , that one . . Yeah , give it to those guys . You can just picture the writers already half out of their chairs and on their way out of the room when someone says wait , what does he do with the money , and they say much the same thing that he says in the movie . You can almost see the indifferent wave of the hand and maybe something like , ' Oh , just have him give it to some charity . ' This reminds me of Hollow Man , which is a film that had nearly endless possibilities , which were all completely ignored in favor of a simplistic and clich√©d plot . I know it may seem like I'm making a big deal about something that's kind of trivial , but it's really not . There could be a lot of meaning delivered in who he gives the money to , and it could have been a lot of fun , too . Even something as simple as what Rudy Duncan ( Ben Affleck ) did with all the money at the end of Reindeer Games ( 2000 ) was more creative and more fun than this . The whole plot involving Winona Ryder's character ( charmingly named ' Babe ' ) was crude and tacked on . While it was interesting that she played a character who tried to skewer Deeds to get a good news story ( albeit a heavily dramatized and altered one ) , the fact that she ultimately falls in love with him and has to convince him that she really loves him after he's already found out that she's been lying to him

You can stick your finger down your throat or watch this pathetic attempt at comedy / drama about young adults in search of relationships . In all fairness to the actors who doggedly go through the paces of trying to bring something meaningful to a thoroughly inane script , the film fails because the characters are shallow , two dimensional , plastic replicas of people for whom we're made to feel nothing . The film ricochets off humor , bends around reality , and ignores pathos . It's shallow , hollow , empty , and is about as satisfying as tofu .

580,"Text1: Stupid and not much fun either I could say that this film isn't rubbish , but then I'd be a liar . Boa vs . Python is one of those ' Sci Fi Original ' films that I usually avoid ; but for some reason I decided to give this one a go , and it turned out to be a completely pointless endeavour . It's a sad state of affairs when it's been seventy one years since the release of the groundbreaking monster movie ' King Kong ' and the special effects have actually got WORSE ; but unfortunately that is the case here as this film features CGI that looks like it cost just a few pence to put together , and the result is completely condemning for the film as it is both impossible to take seriously and impossible to admire . If the filmmakers had spent time making real effects and the result was poor then you could at least have given them marks for trying ; but when all they've done is just plant some CGI into the film , then there's just no way to respect the effort . Of course , you'd have to be a fool to go into this film expecting anything else , really . The plot is both thin and stupid and simply follows a great big python on the lose , and a pea brained Government plan to release a giant Boa ( which just happens to exist ) in order to track the giant python . There is some justification in that the Government uses other animals ( e . g . sniffer dogs ) . . . but clearly this ' plan ' was put into place simply to get two big snakes in one stupid movie . The stupidity doesn't end there , however , as we are also ' treated ' to a barrage of ridiculous characters and an even worse script that includes a boatload of painful one-liners . Despite having two big snakes in the film ; director David Flores somehow manages to miss the opportunity to make things entertaining . There's a scene that sees a couple in a car come a cropper of the snake and a nightclub scene that went wrong somehow . This film will probably be a target for anyone that enjoys bad films ; and I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who doesn't . Even so . . . there are ' better ' bad movies out than this one .


Text2: Christopher Lee raises hell in Bava's baroque horror romance ! Mario Bava is often hailed as one of the true gods of horror cinema , and for good reason . His influence extends his filmography , and many Mario Bava films have gone on to have a big effect on the horror genre on the whole . Films such as Bay of Blood and Black Sunday are well known and have been seen by many serious film fanatics , but when you delve deeper into the man's list of directorial credits , his lesser known films tend to be just as good as his major hits . The Whip and the Body is one such film , and after viewing it ; I rate it among the very top of the man's movies . This Gothic horror romance features many of Mario Bava's trademarks , which are the things that have won him such high praise from a number of well-informed sources . The story follows Nevenka , a young woman who is married to Christian , son of the lord of the castle in which the film takes place . However , things aren't so simple as Christian's brother , Kurt , a sadistic nobleman is still in love with his brother's bride and has returned to the castle to reclaim his girl . Things really get interesting when he is found dead , only for his ghost to reappear inside the castle walls . One of things that Mario Bava is often highly praised for is his use of lighting , and this film features what is probably the best use of lighting ever seen in a Bava film . The lights give flair to the scenery , and help to give the film that picturesque cinematography that the former cinematographer creates so well . Despite being excellent , however , it's not the lighting that is the main standout in this movie ; it's the soundtrack . Giving the film a tragic love story atmosphere , the powerful theme bodes with the lighting to help create a tense and powerful atmosphere , in which Bava allows his actors to inhabit . This film represents the only pairing of Bava with British horror icon Christopher Lee , and as usual Lee lights up the screen with his persona and screen presence . The whipping scenes are what made this film notorious in the first place , and seeing Lee enjoying delivering the lashing is haunting and even quite frightening ! The romance element of the story is wonderfully done , and it offsets the horror of the story well , which ultimately brings the film into balance . I rate this Bava film as one of the best the great Italian ever made and it therefore comes with a soaring recommendation .

( Don't Go in the Basement , Donnie ? ) This is "" an edgy , psychological thriller about a suburban teen coming face-to-face with his dark destiny , "" according to the promotional verbiage for the film , starring Jake Gyllenhaal as "" a delusional high school student visited by a demonic rabbit with eerie visions of the past and deadly predictions for the future . "" This description hardly scratches the surface of "" Donnie Darko "" . While watching the film , to enjoy a quirky , satisfying thriller , you may get the impression may be watching something more meaningful . You are . Repeated viewings ( recommended ) will reveal completely different films . Writer / director Richard Kelly creates more than a movie monster . "" Donnie Darko "" is an multi-layered , inspirational , and beautifully produced work . Most obviously , it is superbly written and directed . Mr . Kelly , who really pulls a rabbit out of his hat , should have received an "" Academy Award "" , along with several members of his crew ; perhaps , the film's more "" independent "" status was an obstacle . The cast is exceptional , from Mr . Gyllenhaal's central role , to the many supporting characterizations , right down to the smallest players . This film is full of memorable characters , arriving on the screen for a variety of reasons , and for various lengths of time , to serve a defined purpose . They're all jewels . The film is set in Middlesex , Suburbia , during 1988 . Forget April , for the Darko family , October is the cruelest month . Gyllenhaal is a kid held back in high school , for burning down a house . Presently , Gyllenhaal is a disturbed sleepwalker , who is not taking his medication ; perhaps , intuitively , he knows it wouldn't make any difference . Gyllenhaal lives with mother Mary McDonnell ( as Rose Darko ) , father Holmes Osborne ( as Eddie Darko ) , big sister Maggie Gyllenhaal ( as Elizabeth Darko ) , and little sister Daveigh Chase ( as Samantha Darko ) . They're all jewels . As with the entire cast , it's difficult to single out one Darko family performance . Gyllenhaal never disappoints . Secondarily , Ms . McDonnell's may be the best , due to Kelly's skillful writing . Motherly love , for a son who seems to be drifting into madness , is wondrous ; the delicacy of McDonnell's performance is perfectly suited to Gyllenhaal's fragility . Even Ms . Chase , who you'd expect to be the minor Darko , is magical ; she even writes about "" The Last Unicorn "" , Ariel ( before he died in the possession of Count Petofi ) . The characters who exist outside the Darko family are as important . Many of them are teachers . At school , Drew Barrymore ( as Karen Pomeroy ) covers English literature in spectacular fashion ; she challenges students ' critical thinking skills , and gives Gyllenhaal guidance . As one of the film's producers , Ms . Barrymore's the most valuable member of the faculty lounge . Beth Grant ( as Kitty Farmer ) displays a limitless ability to multitask . Noah Wyle ( as Kenneth Monnitoff ) lurks in the science department , and helps Gyllenhaal consider slipping into time . Moreover , he reveals the truth about Patience Cleveland ( as "" Grandma Death "" aka Roberta Sparrow ) , who whispers : "" Every living creature on Earth dies alone . "" Among the students , new girl in school Jena Malone ( as Gretchen Ross ) provides Gyllenhaal with love interest ; and , with a dark past of her own , she's a natural . Katharine Ross ( as Lilian Thurman ) is a dignified and memorable hypno-therapist . Patrick Swayze ( as Jim Cunningham ) plays the self-help guru with a convenient focus , "" Controlling Fear "" . Even small parts shine , like Jolene Purdy ( as Cherita Chen ) . And , imaginary friend James Duval ( as Frank ) belongs in a very special class ( note , he is not actually related to the addiction-signaling "" Harvey "" ) . Finally , the soundtrack , including original music by Michael Andrews , has to be one of the best assembled for a motion picture .

Text2: The Great Valley Adventure I finally was able to watch all the Land Before Time sequels , as silly as they may be , I loved the original Land Before Time and I read a lot of these scary comments , I was still curious about them . So I was expecting nothing but trash when it came to the first sequel , granted I know that the singing doesn't really do much for the story and it's a bit stupid , but actually I thought this was a decent family movie that is very enjoyable . It's a great story for the kids , it's harmless and has great morals . The reason I think there's a lot of hate on the sequels is because of the love we all have for the first Land Before Time , but I think this is just a new way for the generation of today to enjoy the same stories we had . Littlefoot and his friends are living happily in their new home , under their families ' watchful eyes . When the gang tries to get to the sheltering grass to play , but land in the quicksand surrounding it , the grownups come and rescue them , then lecture them that night . Cera then tells the others that they need to prove they are independent by running away for a while into the Mysterious Beyond , a location just outside the valley . Before they leave , they notice two egg nappers stealing an egg from Ducky's nest . They chase them into the Beyond , during which a landslide occurs . The egg rolls safely back to the nest , but the five are under the impression that it was destroyed in the landslide . Then , Ducky notices what looks like the egg , only slightly larger . The gang "" return "" this egg to the Valley , only to find out that the stolen egg and this one are not the same . They decide to hatch it , nonetheless , until the egg hatches , revealing a baby sharptooth . While the others run away , Littlefoot decides he's safe , and tries to raise the hatchling on leaves . When he hears the others calling for help , as the egg nappers Ozzy and Strut are attacking them , he runs to their aid , while "" Chomper "" follows him . Chomper's shadow frightens the villains away , after which Littlefoot exchanges introductions between Chomper and the others and they accept him . But how is the Valley going to accept a sharp tooth ? You'll have to watch to find out . Yeah , the plot is predictable , the singing isn't necessary , and the story may be a little Barney-like , but don't go into these sequels expecting Citizen Kane . Just have fun with them . I know I'm a sap , but I just loved Chomper and Littlefoot's relationship , it was so adorable the way Chomper just wanted to hang onto Littlefoot and was like his shadow . I felt that this story had a great moral to the kids and personally as an adult I still find it very watchable . These movies are made more so for the kids , so give these films a break , The Land Before Time 2 is a good movie .

It's a very old theme , but in here it is told very stylishly and with a lot of panache by director George Hickenlooper based on the screenplay written by Phillip Jayson Lasker . At the outset , I must say that I'm not the greatest fan of Andy Garcia , but I have to confess that in this film he does probably his best work , despite of other praised roles in the past . His Byron Tiller is a loser . We sense it the moment we see him in Rizzoli trying to recommend his book to an indecisive customer . His curiosity trying to find out what his office neighbor , Luther Fox , is up to , proves to be his eventual downfall . At home life seems very normal with Dena , his wife , and son . Being broke makes him accept an offer he should have turned down from the very beginning . The encounter with the Allcotts , Tobias , a best selling author at the end of his life , and Andrea , his wife will be fatal . Are we to believe this was a chance encounter , or was it planned before hand ? Ultimately the viewer will have to arrive to his own conclusions . All the acting is first rate . Andy Garcia is very effective . So is the rest of the cast , but Mick Jagger is superb portraying this lizard kind of a man who deals with very special situations and needs . Also notable , Olivia Williams , as the ice queen that doesn't even take off her undergarments for a tumble in the hay . James Coburn is a sly fox who knows what he's doing from the very beginning . Julianna Margulies is the only one that has very little to do as the suffering wife . The film has a glossy and sophisticated look . Viewing it will be satisfying because basically it's a good story well paced and acted .

584,"Text1: where no TV shows have gone before ! ( always wanted a log-line like that ) Star Trek is one of the true zeitgeists of TV history , a show that is about as unlikely to be popular as imaginable , but it caught on to the audience eventually , and today , half a dozen more series ( not counting the animated Star Trek TOS ) , ten or so movies , and a mind-boggling number of Trekkie conventions , have come out of its wake . To be honest , I'm not a usual "" Trekkie "" - I'd probably turn down an offer to go check out a convention , or pose questions about episode 2 . 5 and what cre # 5 wore on the planet next to blah-blah . But even when the show gets corny - and it gets corny and cheesy and reveling-low-budget often - it attempts to surpasses things that make it melodrama into the realm of smart science fiction . It's rousing action and daring-dos , and it also probes in questioning form here and there the nature of the universe , of man in conquest , dominance , subversion , submission , mind-melds , monsters , Platonians , ships-that-are-she's , evil goatees , and so on and so forth . I know , I sound like I'm not taking the show seriously . But as a piece of pop entertainment it can be as absorbing as anything that was produced in the period or since . Through the cheap sets and the very "" plastic "" special effects , and even through William Shatner , who can ham-bone at times like it's some kind of manic art-form ( just watch the last episode of the series - before it was canceled - as Kirk's soul is taken over by a jealous ex-lover in hysterics , or the "" ship-called-she "" episode ) , it has good storytelling , and strong ideas expressed from time to time . One can't admire the episode when McCoy goes nuts and gets transported back to depression era America , and the hand of fate falls down hard on Kirk and Spock . Or the much heralded classic first featuring Ricardo Montebaum , who has just as much sneaky charisma as in the movie ( minus the fake chest ) . Or when Sulu suddenly went all Errol Flynn in a manic state . Or even . . . well , this could go on a while . Suffice to say Roddenberry had it right : get some good writers , make things always punchy with dialog and situations of peril and the most asinine moments become enthralling TV . And , in a strange way , the original series carries a pathos with it , a charming quality with the stories and the characters , as well as some creative uses of mind control and the misuses of power , by the enemy or those on the Enterprise , that might be a little absent in the other series . While the acting quota might have been higher with Picard and the others , Kirk , Spock , and McCoy and all the others allow their stars to fill their shoes proudly , with many scenes that end up surprising those that expect the same shtick every episode ( Nimoy crying , or singing , is enough to give belly laughs for about a week ) . In retrospect , it might be difficult to differentiate how much of the show works as legitimate science fiction theater and how much of it is fun cause of the ' so-bad-it's-good ' quality that has it just a notch above most MST3K movies . But Roddenberry and the Star Trek crew straddle that line wonderfully , allowing moments of guilty pleasure and real delight in a series that worked , in its - ish episode run , consistently . It's the kind of show that you may start watching on TV a few minutes after it starts , and it sucks you in , as if in some Vulcan mind-meld .


Text2: it's not a terrible movie , it's just . . . . . huh ? I remember seeing Romeo + Juliet in a high school English class . . . or at least I'd like to pretend I did . If anything , I probably remember reading the actual play more , or maybe when they tried to do the comparison with Zeferelli's far superior 1968 version . Bored one day ( very bored , though sadly not with the wherewithal to pick up a book like a more sane person ) , I saw Romeo + Juliet was on cable and stayed tuned to watch it . It's not as bad I've heard from some , which is that it's one of the worst films ever made . It's somehow weirdly watchable in some instances and shots and moments . Baz Lurhmann isn't a hack , that much is completely certain , he's got too much verve and POP in his style to be easily ignored . This is in fact what made Moulin Rouge , for better or worse , the significant achievement it was . But all the technical razzle dazzle in this case can't cover up the biggest problem of all : casting . And I don't mean that in the sense of "" oh , casting these hot young people of the 90s like Di Caprio and Claire Danes and , uh , John Leguizamo I guess "" , that notion is a given . Watching the film today , after years of knowing Romeo & Juliet and Shakespeare work in general , the actors with one or two exceptions can't pull off the performances . Lurhmann leaves these kids and other character players like Harold Pirenneau and even a strange walk-on like Paul Sorvino to fend for themselves . And as for the two stars , Di Caprio and Danes , they are pretty to look at , but the performances clearly don't have a kind of focus that's required with the material . Perhaps this is more than anything not so much a fault of the director's in that "" oh , I'll cast them for this look and that "" , but of simple things like rehearsal . I can imagine Lurhmann taking so much time to prepare how to make Verona the Verona-on-speed of his world , the Capulets and Montagues in their power games and battles , all super-designed and made out in super 90s sheek with some 80s leftover . So in short , there is a vision here , but its squandered when the human elements are left beside . Some bits are worthwhile , like Pete Posthlethwaie ( sic ) s the priest , but really the main attraction is to try and lure in mall kids who wouldn't go near the Bard with a ten foot pair of designer jeans under normal circumstances . It's shiny and goes fast and crazy , but there's not a lot of substance much . . . at all . That being said , it's fun to re-live some of the 90s music , as cheesy as it can get .

Many of those who had a significant role in the making of the movie provide interesting stories about their memories of Suspiria and how it was put together . My favorite parts were the interviews with Cinematographor Luciano Tovoli and star Jessica Harper . Tovoli provides some great background into how the movie was filmed , including the use of Technicolor to get those incredibly vibrant colors for which Suspiria is so famous . As Harper is the only American to appear in the documentary , I found it particularly insightful to hear her impressions of working with Argento and in Italy at such a young age .

586,"Text1: Another ' Ballroom Dancing as a Means of Improving Life ' Story The concept of taking the gentility of ballroom dancing with all the skills and discipline it requires and using that as a means of changing young people who are floating aimlessly toward possible destruction is a sound one , as evidenced in this ' biography ' of the life of Pierre Dulaine . Unfortunately the topic is overused to the point of becoming a ho-hum script gimmick and that is unfortunate . There are many things to like about this film , but the script and direction manage to go for sellout at the end , ruining what otherwise could have been a tender film . Antonio Banderas plays Dulaine , a man with a void in his life which changes when he encounters a high school lad Rock ( Rob Brown ) destroying the high school principal's car : Principal Augustine James ( Alfre Woodard ) is a hard-nosed disciplinarian whose heart is in the right place but who alienates her students , creating the need for a Detention Hall . Dulaine approaches James with the idea of teaching the tough kids ballroom dancing while they are in detention and after some thought , James goes for it . Dulaine is faced with unbelieving and disrespectful students , which he eventually wins over on terms that show respect for their potential and the ballroom dancing begins - a competition just happens to be in the offing ! The young cast is fairly strong , with some actors such as Yaya DaCosta , Jenna Dewan , Jasika Nicole , Dante Basco , Brandon D . Andrews , and Marcus T . Paulk being particularly fine . The girls are the dancers here and they steal the show . The problems with the script are with the choices of emphasis : we know little about Dulaine and too much about incidental kids . But the message is clear . The movie begins well , sags in the middle , and then just when there is the big finish , the story about the influence of ballroom dancing , etiquette , and pride disintegrates into a rather meaningless and long hip-hop session on a formal dance floor .

Young Swiss filmmaker Lionel Baier has both written ( with Laurent Guido ) and directed with quasi-autobiographical story that explores the coming of age of a lower class young lad who seems destined to settle for being a hustler . Loic ( first time actor Pierre Chatagny ) works in an assembly line chocolate factory in Bulle , Switzerland and his only ' life ' is provided through his internet activity meeting men for sex . His casual sexual encounters ( rather graphically shown in the first portion of the film ) are his only answer to relating to people until he meets Marie ( Natacha Koutchoumov ) with whom he rooms and bonds . Marie is bright and encourages Loic , uneducated and uninformed , to look up words he encounters - a simple but well-intended manner in which Loic can improve himself . He meets the older Lionel ( played by the director Lionel Baier ) who dangles before Loic's eyes the possibilities of finer things in life . Loic spends his idle hours with a digital camera and between his new interest in photography and his pursuing his ' basic ' education , he begins to long for a life more significant than his brainless casual sex . He becomes friends with a soccer player and his son , loses his friendship with Marie when Marie finds a real lover , and ultimately Loic yearns to escape the life of the ' stupid boy ' of the title and enters a dreamworld fantasy of something better . Good ideas for a film here , but Baier seems to get sidetracked into artsy camera work , quasi-porno , and surrealistic moving lights and alpine scenery , and the film falters as a result . But there does seem to be some promise of a new filmmaker on the rise , This film may not be tolerated by some for various reasons , but for the adventurous spirits who are unafraid of a bit of male frontal nudity and sexual acting out , here are redeeming aspects to this little film that merit attention .

587,"Text1: A sweet and likable romantic comedy . A certain someone I know considers "" Serendipity "" her favorite movie , and although it's not one of my favorites it is far better than I ever expected , thanks mostly to its strong cast : John Cusack , Kate Beckinsale and a very funny small turn by Eugene Levy . Pretty much a story of fate and how Cusack's character goes crazy searching for a woman he met one night . It's all about fate and once in a lifetime happening twice . This is definitely a romantic comedy i . e . it's a chick flick , but it's one of the better ones out there and most men would probably be able to enjoy it ( almost ) as much . Overall I was surprised by how entertaining it was and it has a fair amount of very funny jokes . It's not John Cusack's best comedy ( see : "" High Fidelity "" ) but it's one of his better attempts at playing a typical Nice Guy role in a romantic comedy - better than "" American Sweethearts "" , anyway .


Text2: George Lucas presents a grim Kubrick-style vision of the future - "" Star Wars "" fans will be surprised ! This is simply a solid , well-made film , produced on a low budget and directed by George Lucas based on his early student film of ( roughly ) the same title . ( Which is included on the Director's Cut edition of the DVD . ) Fans of "" A Clockwork Orange , "" "" 1984 , "" "" Brazil , "" and similar films about oppressive bureaucracies will love this . It's a grim and gritty vision of the future in which people are controlled and monitored ( think Big Brother on a large scale ) . Robert Duvall ( THX 1138 being his "" assigned name "" ) breaks the laws of the world by falling in love , engaging in sex and therefore rebelling , placing him and his love in danger . This is a very clear moral story and allusion to politics and so on and so forth . It excels as both story and study . Duvall gives a good performance ( his breakthrough role in "" The Godfather "" would come next year ) but the real surprise here is Lucas , who goes for a Kubrick-like edge to his film that really separates it from his later work . You won't believe this is from the guy who created Jar-Jar Binks . If anyone accuses George Lucas of being the schmaltzy sell-out he has now become , direct them to this film in order to prove that , at one point in his life , he really did have a bleak outlook on life and the future , and it didn't start with the words "" A long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . .

588,"Text1: Into the Jungle Again with Werner Herzog Director Werner Herzog returns once more to the wilds of the jungle and yet one more protagonist who finds there the atmosphere to feed his frenzied obsessions . In this one , Klaus Kinski plays an opera lover who is determined to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon rain forest . In order to achieve his dream , though , he must first make a fortune in the area's biggest industry : rubber . The scheme he conjures up involves sailing a boat down one branch of the Amazon , carrying it over a mountain , and sailing up the other side . This feat comprises a large bulk of the film , and was shot without the aid of any special effects . One wonders why Herzog ever bothers to make fiction films at all , since even the ones he does make feel like documentaries . This isn't the first film of his in which the actual narrative storytelling feels obligatory , and is almost lost amid Herzog's detached observation . This marred my enjoyment of "" Fitzcarraldo "" somewhat , as Kinski's objective and the developments of the plot are somewhat difficult to follow . It's as if Herzog has to wrench himself away from simply filming unscripted action when someone on his crew reminds him that he's actually trying to tell a story . However , the viewer is compensated by beautiful , authentic location shooting in the Amazon and fascinating exposure to the native Peruvian tribes . If these were actors and not actual natives , Herzog does a hell of a good job of convincing us otherwise .


Text2: Very difficult , with limited rewards ; possibly better upon repeat viewings Possibly the most confusing movie I've ever sat through , it took me a long time to get anything out of it . I just couldn't grab onto even the slightest shred of a plot , and , without the ability to find a hook , it felt at first like watching a blank wall . But eventually , I started making inroads and , as the film progresses , its chopped-up plot begins to emerge . It is the story of a rapist and murderer and two women with whom he is intricately involved . Shino is one of his rape victims , and also , we find out , a woman he rescued from suicide in the past . Jinbo is the killer's wife , who knows his guilt ( or at least suspects it ) but loves him and wants to protect him . Nagisa Oshima actually went to film school in France , and , though part of the Japanese New Wave , no one will miss the French New Wave influences , especially Alain Resnais , whose films have similarly infuriated me in the past with their difficult narratives . Even if I never understood what the hell happened here , the film has several great aspects . The acting is quite good , that's clear . But , in particular , the music , by Hikaru Hayashi , and the cinematography , by Akira Takada , are extremely beautiful . I think I might like this one better if I give it yet another try .

589,"Text1: Frank's Love Song to Roebling's Bridge , and his duet with Jimmy It's a friendly film from MGM - I can't say it is the best of the early MGM Sinatra musicals ( ON THE TOWN is a good competitor ) , but it certainly gave Frank Sinatra his best part of the musicals . He was dominated in ON THE TOWN , ANCHORS AWAY , and TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAME by co-star partner Gene Kelly ( in fact Kelly has the center of the story lines in several of these ) . Here Sinatra is at center stage for a change , supported by Durante , Grayson , and Peter Lawford . His character is not as annoying naive here as in ANCHORS AWAY , and has opportunities to stretch . The only thing that is missing is that the screenplay shows he has a potential love partner at the end - but sees fit not to have her available for the finale . IT HAPPENED IN BROOKLYN is about a returning soldier ( Sinatra ) . Stationed in England , he is going home and he is taken to task by a nurse ( Gloria Grahame ) for not socializing with his fellow soldiers , or the women at a final dance , or the English people . When she hears he is from Brooklyn ( where she's from too ) she has a fit because ( as she puts it ) Brooklyn people are supposed to be friendly . Prodded , Sinatra fitfully does mingle , and actually makes the acquaintance of a British Duke ( Aubrey Mather ) and his grandson ( Peter Lawford ) . The Duke's mother was from Brooklyn , and he wishes his grandson would stop being so withdrawn and more like the Brooklyn people that Mather has in his blood . Sinatra has already gotten to know that Lawford is a fine pianist and composer , and says that if Lawford ever comes to Brooklyn he should look Sinatra up and Sinatra will do what he could to open Lawford's personality up . [ Aubrey's title is Duke of Dunstable . If so , it shows that the screenwriter was acquainted with Gilbert and Sullivan : the Duke of Dunstable is one of the "" Heavy Dragoons "" who turn aesthetic in the opera PATIENCE . Either that , or that Duke of Dunstable ( from 1881 ) is Aubrey's grandfather - and Lady Jane is his grandmother , and the mother-in-law of the lady from Brooklyn . What would Reginald Bunthorne have said ? ] When Sinatra returns to Brooklyn he meets a music teacher ( Kathrine Grayson ) at his old high school ( New Utrecht High - which is a real high school , by the way ) . He also is reunited with the janitor at the high school ( Durante ) . Jimmy invites Frank to room with him while he tries to find work . Soon his pep talks and support allow Sinatra to get a better job in a music store , and encourage Sinatra to date Grayson . But then Lawford shows up , and he and Grayson soon find themselves left on their own while Sinatra gets involved in his career , Lawford's potential musical career ( as songwriter ) , and helping Grayson push the potentially great career of a local piano prodigy ( William Roy ) who desperate needs a scholarship to continue studies . As Grayson and Lawford are together more and more ( with only Durante noticing what's happening ) the inevitable occurs as they start falling for each other . And we'll leave the conclusion for the viewer to find . It has a nice score , including the standard TIME AFTER TIME . But most movie buffs recall the film's music for two sequences with Frank . In one he just lands in Brooklyn , and he takes a cab to his favorite landmark : the Brooklyn Bridge . And he sings to it . Later , when he has to audition for a promotion at the music store , Durante accompanies him , and they sing the duet "" You Got To Sing From The Heart "" . The latter sequence was shown in the movie THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT - but part was cut , wherein both singers tackle foreign language lyrics ( from "" Oy Tchochonya "" among other tunes ) . But it ends with Frank going into his imitation of Jimmy's style , down to Jimmy's leg movements . He does a nice imitation - and would do it again in later television shows , wherein Jimmy would show up again unannounced . Grayson does her opera aria - the ""

Text2: Query : Is "" acclimatize "" a word or not ? This film is given only a five by me - I stayed up late one night to see it , because I wanted to see Hedy Lamarr in one of her most famous performances . It was about 1971 , in the summertime ( so it was sultry weather - good to see such a tropical film ) . Hedy was good to watch , although her character's dialog and fate were odd . The other cast members , Frank Morgan and Richard Carlson , acted well . But it was watching Walter Pigeon getting all riled up , not only due to the antics of Todelayo but because he could not stand the word "" acclimatize "" being used that lasted longest in my memory . The story is one of jungle rot . Pigeon , Carlson , and Morgan ( and other males in the cast ) are working on a plantation in Africa , and life there is not made easier by the arrival of Lamarr , a half-breed ( as they called so-called non-white temptresses in the days of the Hollywood "" code "" ) . She snares Carlson , who stupidly marries her . She only sees him as good for buying her luxuries and giving her a meal ticket . SPOILER COMING UPWhen she finally tires of Carlson , Hedy starts poisoning him . Pigeon learns what she is doing , and forces her to drink the poison - and she runs out screaming ( supposedly to die alone somewhere in the jungle ) . The story is impossibly melodramatic claptrap today - I can't imagine a remake without miles of rewriting . It was produced in 1923 on Broadway by Earl Carroll , a man who is now totally forgotten . While Florenz Ziegfeld had his failings , he is remembered fondly as a great theatrical producer with taste - his "" Follies "" had many truly beautiful women in them , but also leading comedians like W . C . Fields , Ed Wynn , Will Rogers , Raymond Hatton , Fanny Brice , and music by Jerome Kern , Victor Herbert , George Gershwin . His classy "" Glorifying the American Woman "" with extravagant costumes really set a standard that is still recalled . Carroll wanted to be Ziegfeld , and created his "" Vanities "" . He too had some good comics working for him , such as Fields ( one year ) , Jimmy Savo , even Jack Benny . But while Ziegfeld dressed up his ladies , Carroll skirted the edge trying to show women as close to naked as possible . Still , for some two decades Carroll remained a well known figure in New York ( and later Hollywood ) producing . This despite a six month jail sentence in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary ( in 1926 ) for lying to a Federal Grand Jury when it was revealed he used illegal booze at a party . He did lie ( it was not too healthy to reveal who was your friendly bootlegger ) . Actually the thing people did not realize about Carroll's party was that it was to honor his fellow Pittsburgh citizen , Harry K . Thaw . The murderer of Stanford White was a potential show biz "" angel "" , and when he showed up Carroll yelled , "" Here's Harry Thaw ! Three cheers for Harry ! "" . That Carroll could say that showed his real lack of character . I doubt if Ziegfeld would have done it . Carroll ( like Ziegfeld ) did produce shows that were not his typical reviews . But Ziegfeld produced shows like SHOWBOAT and THE THREE MUSKETEERS . Carroll produced shows like WHITE CARGO . Carroll claimed it was great art - but he knew that a racially mixed love or lust affair was going to bring in many customers ( especially men ) . Carroll always tried to wrap himself with some first amendment shield or high art shield . It fooled nobody . If you have the time on a wet afternoon , with nothing better to do , then you have reason to catch WHITE CARGO . If you have something better to do , I'd recommend doing it .

Text2: Is there such a thing as trying too hard ? A based-on-fact story of Jimmy Piersall , a major league player of the 1950s who suffered what looks like a major depression with some paranoid ideas . Not much could be done with major league mental illnesses at the time , before the French accidentally discovered anti-psychotic meds . The movie ends , as all such movies do whenever possible , on an up-beat note with Piersall ( Tony Perkins ) returning to the Red Sox after defeating his demons . I have no idea how closely the movie sticks to the real facts of Piersall's life , but it certainly hews close to the formula line . Basically , everything is blamed on Piersall's father ( Karl Malden ) , who pushed the kid too hard , brutally sometimes , to excel . Nothing would do but that Piersall not only play for the Sox but that he play the OUTFIELD . Shortstop wasn't good enough . Poor kid . While still in the minors , in Scranton , he brags to his pop that he's the third highest hitter in the league . Malden smiles and says , "" Well , that's not first . "" Think about that , next time your kid comes home with a B plus on his report card . You want to drive him nuts ? I don't doubt that Piersall's father was pushy about his son's training and career . For all we know there may be as many sports fathers as there are stage mothers . But it seems a bit unfair to make him the sole heavy . It's not easy to drive someone crazy , not as easy as it seems in the movies anyway . It helps a lot , especially with major affective disorders , if you bring something genetic to the party , as numerous studies have shown . Not that genetics explains everything , because one identical twin may "" get it "" while the other doesn't . Anyway , the movie isn't very satisfying , as a movie . The director , Robert Mulligan , has done better work elsewhere . And Tony Perkins gives a by-the-numbers performance as a madman , with his facial muscles trembling and his eyes bulging . How primitive can you get ? He was a much better ( if entirely different ) kind of psychotic in "" Psycho . "" An improved script might have helped him . Malden is okay as the well-meaning but destructive father whom Perkins finally tells off at the cathartic climax . Perkins ' wife's role is underwritten and doesn't contribute much as Malden's potential rival . It would have been nice too if we'd seen a little more about baseball , the sport and the career ladder , and less of the formulaic material on having a breakdown . At least your performance on the baseball diamond is something you can do something about . In the grip of mental illness like Piersall's , you're practically helpless , and that's not too dramatic .

The most glaring hole in this version is the fact that the father ( Max von Sydow ) hired a private detective to investigate the boyfriend of his daughter , and yet he declined to investigate the boyfriend of his other daughter , both played by Sean Young , which would have exposed the plot . Matt Dillon plots to have it all and has to do some things that just stretch us beyond belief to get there . He just seems to be in the right place at the right time just once or twice too often for my tastes . I fell in love with Sean Young when she did No Way Out back in 1987 . I haven't seen much of her lately and understand that she has not been doing so well . I thought she was good in this role and think that she has been unfairly criticized . Still , I believe film noir is best watched in films of the fifties and remakes just don't do it for me .

It belongs to his chase / thriller category but it's neatly plumped out by comedic and serious dramatic interludes . It may seem strictly an entertainment , but that episode involving the dour Scottish farmer and his lonely , compassionate wife is like a little short story in itself , and blended effectively into the overall story . What's also impressive about it is how much it presages Hitchcock's later favorite kinds of scenes . The man stuck in a public space , the exits covered by his pursuers , who must try to improvise his way out of danger . In this instance , Robert Donat sneaks into a political meeting and is mistaken for the keynote speaker . He stands at the podium and gives a rousing speech full of political malarkey that has the audience on its feet clapping and shouting . His pursuers still manage to nail him and lead him away in manacles but as the police escort him through the door , the audience turns and cheers him again while he waves his grinning farewell with a shackled hand . ( A situation nicely handled in "" North by Northwest , "" too , at an auction . ) The fact that it works is evidenced by the thousand times it's been copied . ( Vide , "" The Prize . "" ) The script is quite funny , and sexy too . Scotland looks so barren and windswept . It's hard to believe those bens were once covered by natural forests . The performances are up to par . Poor Donat died of asthma , which is an unpleasant way to go . Madeleine Carrol was a beautiful blond , one of Hitchcock's first . He seemed to like frosty blonds , but he was never a sentimental mope . Years later he was shooting at a location only a few blocks from where Carrol lived and never bothered to visit her . Peggy Ashcroft , as the farmer's wife , gives a first-rate performance . And she has an inner beauty that transcends anything resembling glamor . She looks almost compellingly homely in this part .

Text2: the nightmare and ecstasy of selling your soul to you-know-who Jan Svankmajer probably has visions and dreams that few of us would want to have , but luckily for us he's so creative and talented and all-that-and-a-bag-of-chips with a mound of clay and ( in this case ) marionettes that he can put them all on display on film . His version of Faust is sometimes confusing , bewildering , and , as I gathered from not reading the original play or ( sadly ) not yet seeing the Murnau silent feature , not altogether makes a lot of sense . This isn't to say the central premise is lost on me , which is of a man who conjures up the force that is Mephistopheles and sells his soul . This is of course shown at one pivotal moment in the film , but if you think you know what to expect from this outcome or how it's presented you might have to rethink things . If you've seen Svankmajer's other films , however , like Alice , then some of his approach shouldn't seem too far out . . . Actually , it is always very far out , but in an approachable manner , told often in a classical style of cinema that relies often on the unspoken . In this case it's not as non-dialog laden as Alice , as there are often scenes with the marionettes going on and on with their dialogs , and then with the man and the Satan figure him / itself ( whether it's a man or an ' it ' I can't say for sure , as Svankmajer makes it a being who materializes first as some skull , then into a near reflection of the man himself as some crazy theologian ) . What draws one in is the lack of abandon for narrative , and the chances he takes in making it self-conscious . It would be one thing to present the puppets themselves , but the editing is feverish ; cuts go between the puppets , their movements , and then those of the puppeteer's hands . We never see their faces , but we always know someone is pulling the strings . This is key . But beyond simply that , it's just a pure pleasure to take in how the filmmaker mixes the elements , tricks it up on the audience ( i . e . after the marionettes inside for so long , they bust out into the streets without puppeteer's hands ) , and with the stop motion , and the moments of Bunuelian surrealism with the man going between puppet form and reality , and then out in the middle of some field . I can hardly explain more , and it would be better , after all , if he was allowed to introduce himself . Staggering , near masterpiece work .

So taking on more edgy , angst characters might just be their quick solution . Anne Hathaway lost her clothes and borrowed a foul mouth for her turn in Havoc , and Justin Timberlake here lost his coolness but almost always brought sexy back in his scenes , despite having tattoos riddling his toned body , and adopting as foul a mouth as Hathaway's Allison Lang . Nick Cassavetes ' Alpha Dog , the closing film of Sundance 2006 , tells of a true story , with a little mockumentary spin put on . Alpha Dog is like a Beverly Hills 90210 episode gone all wrong , where rich kids spend all their time in vice activities , including smoking weed ( they even grow their own in their backyard ) , guzzling tonnes of alcohol , humping anything that moves , and peppering their vocabulary with expletives . I swear almost every sentence has the F-word in its numerous permutations , showcasing that it is indeed a word for any occasion . And it makes you wonder how much trouble these perpetually high bored kids get into so easily , without using their brains much and constantly shooting from their hips . For every action , there is reaction , and without considering the circumstances and outcome , personal pride , ego , or just blind faith , can bring about a chain of events with outcomes that are inevitable . Johnny Truelove ( up and coming actor Emile Hirsh , who had starred in Lords of Dogtown , and the upcoming Speed Racer as Speed ) and Jake Mazursky ( Angel in X3 ) can't settle their feud over 800 bucks , and bad blood start to spill when boisterous dares under the influence of alcohol become tit for tat revenge . In a mindless spur of the moment retaliation , Jake's brother Zack ( Anton Yelchin , he one who will be Chekov in the new Star Trek movie ) gets bundled into a van , leaving everyone perplexed just what to do next . Timberlake , being an idol , gets to portray his character with pretty much being the best of the worst of them all . Being easy going and the man with the plan , he strikes up a brotherly friendship with Zack , which is possibly the number one rule of kidnapping , never to do . Getting chummy with your prey is always bad karma , and hinders hard decisions made . But for the most parts of the movie , this friendship takes centerstage . But that's not to say the rest of the cast were strolling in the park , as Hirsh was excellent in his role as the crazed , dazed and confused de facto leader Johnny Truelove , with his impulses usually getting the best ( worse ? ) out of him . Looking pretty much like a bearded Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond and The Departed , there's a little Catch Me If YOu Can spin in the latter half of the story , with unexpected help from Dad ( Bruce Willis , in yet another supporting role ) . There are a number of recognizable faces playing supporting roles here , like Sharon Stone and Dominique Swain ( she has disappeared for a long time ) , but the narrative calls for nothing much from them . Perhaps one of the best scenes was a reminisce of the car ride in Seven , with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman driving Kevin Spacey , ad he rattles off his motives and rationale behind what he's doing . In the equivalent here , there was a tinge of sadness , and how it played out to the end will no doubt bring about some very mixed emotions , all rolled into one . If there's any moment from the movie that can justify putting a bum in the seat , this will be my justification . Those who can't survive listening to obscenities being rattled off with aplomb , or can't bear to witness their idol mouthing off , should steer clear of Alpha Dog . Otherwise , it offers , like Voice of a Murderer , a Crimewatch like narrative that recounts real events , and of course with certain dramatic license taken .

Gomez ( Raul Julia ) and Morticia ( Anjelica Huston ) are the parental units of a macabre and twisted yet ultimately loving family that also includes their children Wednesday ( Christina Ricci , in one of her earliest roles ) and Pugsley ( Jimmy Workman - whatever happened to him ? ) , Granny ( Judith Malina ) and their associates Lurch ( Carel Struycken ) and Thing ( Christopher Hart's hand ) . Their slimy attorney Tully ( a well-cast Dan Hedaya ) makes the acquaintance of Gordon ( Christopher Lloyd ) , the brutish son of the harridan ( Elizabeth Wilson ) to whom Tully is in debt . Tully , after noticing the remarkable resemblance Gordon has to the Addams ' long-lost Uncle Fester , plants him in the household so that Gordon can attempt to plunder their fortune . This simple plot actually leads to a reasonably well-written movie with impressive design and effects , and lots of good laughs . The actors play their parts so well I can't help but be impressed . Although the world of the Addams family is the brainchild of Charles Addams , I also find it reminiscent of a Tim Burton-type imagination as well . One sequence that works quite well is when the Addams are forced from their home and forced to live in "" the real world "" . Thing even gets a job as a courier for Fed Ex !

Apparently , Kern is suggesting that handguns are ' supposed to be ' male objects , yet here are these very sexy and unquestionably female women engaged in the ' male ' activities of gun-love and shooting . "" X is Y "" features some thrash music by a band with the appropriate name Cop Shoot Cop . Kern shows some genuine directorial talent within his narrow self-appointed genre , and the women in this movie are very delightful to look at . I'll rate this quickie .


Text2: The middle portion of a bleak triptych . ' My Ain Folk ' is the second of three autobiographical films written and directed by Bill Douglas , recounting his childhood and adolescence . In all three films , the protagonist - - ostensibly Bill Douglas's alter ego - - is cried Jamie . The name change warns us that some fictionalisation is in the works , but we're never told precisely at which points in the story , nor how extensively . The most famous case of this sort of substitution would be the example of Francois Truffaut and his cinematic alter ego Antoine Doinel . I suspect that Jamie conforms more closely to Bill Douglas's life than Doinel to Truffaut's . SPOILERS AHEAD . Cleverly yet bitterly , this movie opens with displays of triumph . We see a collie ( a Scottish breed ) standing atop a mountain above a glorious vista of landscape , in full colour . This quickly turns out to be a Lassie movie being screened in Jamie's local cinema , a tuppenny fleapit in a coal-mining town . From here out , the rest of the film is in monochrome . From collie to colliery in one painful reel change . I found the first instalment in this trilogy , ' My Childhood ' , so utterly realistic as to be a painful experience . ' My Ain Folk ' , by contrast , felt slightly more like something Dickens invented for one of his novels . ' My Childhood ' bleakly but expertly limned the utter desperation and grinding poverty of Jamie and his half-brother Tommy , raised by their elderly ' gran ' while their mother languishes in a mental institution . Very realistic and compelling . Here in ' My Ain Folk ' , up pops some tosh about a necklace which Jamie's mother has hidden , which apparently has enough value that someone else wants to find it . Pull the other one ! Although I'm more than a decade younger than Douglas , I came from a background very similar ( in Perthshire and a Glasgow council estate ) and I know damned well that people this poor never have any heirlooms . Any object that can stave off hunger for a couple of hours is sold , bartered or pawned . Throughout this bleak trilogy , Douglas uses apples symbolically : they seem to represent prized treasures which are highly desirable in this impoverished landscape . In ' My Ain Folk ' , there's a close-up of a large dish containing only one small Bramley apple and a set mousetrap . This felt to me like the sort of art-house image which director Douglas normally avoided . . . but it turned out that there was a legitimate reason for placing the trap next to the apple . During one shot of Jamie standing astride the local railway line , we hear on the soundtrack an offscreen train coming steadily nearer and louder , yet Jamie shows no inclination to get off the sleepers . ( In the previous instalment , he actually lay down with his head on the rails ! ) Suddenly the train comes hurtling into the frame . . . on a different track we hadn't noticed before . This one shot reminded me of several Buster Keaton films . Elsewhere in this movie , the soundtrack cuts out entirely . I started to put this down to alienation or some other symbolism , but apparently Douglas just had grotty film recording . After the death of Jamie's gran , the film ends with a slight note of triumph : we see a Highland band marching downhill ( another symbol ? ) while piping ' Scotland the Brave ' . In all three instalments of this trilogy , Douglas wrings astonishing performances from a ( mostly ) non-professional cast , and gets full benefit from the cinema-verite settings . I found the first instalment of this bleak trilogy ( ' My Childhood ' ) deeply depressing yet moving , partly because some of it resembled my own experiences . I found ' My Ain Folk ' equally depressing yet less cathartic . I'll rate this downer , mostly in recognition of Douglas's skill rather than his depressing choice of subject matter .

596,"Text1: Werewolf turns into a soap opera . Werewolf : A World of Difference : Part 2 starts as bounty hunter Alamo Joe Rogan ( Lance LeGault ) lies in a hospital bed awaiting the results of ultrasound tests that will determine whether he was bitten by the Werewolf or merely scratched , the difference being that if Rogan has been bit he too will have the Werewolf curse . Meanwhile at the morgue Eric's body goes missing . . . Episode twelve from the first & only season of Werewolf this originally aired in the US during October 1987 , directed by James Darren this one feels like it's going into bland soap opera territory . This episode revolves entirely around bounty hunter Rogan , like the first part of this story there's lots of flashbacks as Rogan contemplates his situation & things that have happened . He recalls having discussions with his wife which is where the slight soap opera feel comes in , his boss & an expert on Wolves which gives the production team the chance to throw in lots of facts about real life Wolves , how they live & other little titbit's . There's not a whole lot here to get excited about , rather uniquely Eric as a human does not feature in this episode at all except briefly at the start when he is seen dead at the morgue & as such this is the only episode where Eric doesn't have any dialogue or significantly effect the outcome of the episode . This is well made as usual with some effective nighttime sequences although this is very short on action , in fact once the Werewolf breaks out of the morgue it just disappears . Since this episode focuses on Rogan , his character & his motivations you would ideally need have seen some of the earlier episodes to fully know what's going on & it pretty much finishes as it starts with Eric on the run still a Werewolf & bounty hunter Rogan still trying to capture & kill him , you could probably skip this two parter & you wouldn't be missing anything significant . A World of Difference : Part 2 isn't that great & has little to recommend it , it's worth a watch for fans of the show but as a stand alone episode it's one of the worst without even any decent Werewolf action .


Text2: "" I'm actually a few millimetre's taller . "" Either an absolute masterpiece or a boring mess , I'm not too sure which . Dead Ringers starts in ' Toronto , Canada 1954 ' where two 9 year old identical twins named Beverly ( Jonathan Haley ) & Elliot Mantle ( Nicholas Haley ) are geeky bespectacled nerds who everyone think are weird as they conduct dissection experiments on plastic toy human anatomy kits . . . Then Dead Ringers jumps forward to ' Cambridge , Massachusettes 1967 ' where the now 23 year old Beverly & Elliot ( both superbly played by Jeremy Irons from here on in ) are brilliant medical students who win an award for the piece of medical equipment they have developed , the film then finally settles in ' Toronto , Canada 1988 ' where the Elliot brothers are both highly respected & successful gynaecologist's . Their latest patient is actress Claire Niveau ( Genevieve Bujold ) who the confident Elliot quickly beds & thereafter Elliot & his brother the withdrawn Beverly take turns with her pretending to be one person . That is until Beverly develops strong feelings for Claire who finds out what has happened through one of her friends Laura ( Shirley Douglas ) , Beverly is torn between his domineering brother & Claire . Eventually Beverly becomes addicted to drugs , his career suffers , his mental state deteriorates & becomes dangerously unstable . . . Co-written & directed by David Cronenberg Dead Ringers is an intriguing film & one which I'm in two minds over . The script by Cronenberg & Norman Snider is based on the novel Twins by Bari Wood & Jack Geasland & Dead Ringers is for the most part a deep & intellectual character study of the mental & personal breakdown of the relationship of two close twins . Anyone looking for Cronenberg's typical gore & outlandish imagery will be somewhat disappointed here with a few serious looking medical instruments , a dream sequence in which Elliot & Beverly are joined together & Beverly bites through the skin & some shots with a few drops of blood here & there plus a couple of sex scenes being just about as graphic as Dead Ringers gets . Instead Cronenberg goes for psychological horror rather than visual , the relationship between Elliot & Beverly starts normal if a little creepy & the film goes into great detail as we witness the twins drift apart & subsequently their lives falling to pieces , in fact I can't remember a single scene that doesn't feature at least one of the twins . It's quite strong stuff & will keep most people engaged & gripped although having said that at almost 2 hours it's a long film which has a slow pace & is dialogue driven , however Dead Ringers should reward those patient enough to put the effort in & watch it just don't expect lots of special effects & explosions , in fact don't expect any . You will have to concentrate though as I sometimes found it difficult to know which twin was which at certain points as they are literally identical . Technically Dead Ringers is superb , the production design is great with lots of sleek shiny surfaces & modern interiors & just look at those red surgical gowns that they wear that look like something out of a religious ceremony . The quite classical sounding music , the simple yet highly effective cinematography , the special computer effects that you won't know are there that let two Jeremy Irons appear in the same scene & Cronenberg's fantastic direction that will make you care for these character's & the situation they find themselves in add up to make Dead Ringers a first class production . The acting by Irons is brilliant , he makes this film so watchable as he is in just about every scene as either Elliot or Beverly , I was feeling sorry for both of them by the end . Basically Dead Ringers is a fantastic drama with a few scenes of typical Cronenberg that pushes it into borderline horror territory , however Dead Ringers is not for everyone as it can be very slow at times I suppose you could say not that much actually happens & I'm not sure I would want to watch it again anytime soon . Definitely worth a watch for Cronenberg fans & those with the patience . A challenging film .

597,"Text1: Those airmen in their flying machines Otto Preminger was perhaps honing his skills as a director , because this film seems to be a dress rehearsal for his greatest achievement , "" Anatomy of a Murder "" , which is a classic of the courtroom drama genre . The movie is interesting in that it presents a man of honor , Billy Mitchell , who not only was an aviation pioneer , but a visionary that pointed out to the future in uncanny ways . He realized that wars were going to be fought in the air , and that soon the world would shrink thanks to faster planes than the primitive two engine jobs he was flying during WWI . Billy Mitchell was an outcast , rejected by the same people that were too obtuse to realize the upcoming revolution in aeronautics . In trying to prove a point , Billy is found guilty and tried for disobeying orders . It's a sad story in which a highly developed mind , like Billy's has to contend with the ignorance of his peers . Testimony from other leading figures of the time , such as Eddie Rickenbacker , and others speak volumes about Mitchell's incredible insight on the new technology and how vulnerable America was from air raids by enemies . Gary Cooper's approach to the role doesn't clarify much about the real life Mitchell . He is not quite as effective as in many of his most outstanding films . Somehow we don't get any passion out of his character , where perhaps another actor would have run away with the role . Mr . Cooper's take on Mitchell , or perhaps Otto Preminger's direction , doesn't shed much insight in the character . The best thing in the movie is Rod Steiger as Allan Gullion , who is brought to the trial to help the main prosecution officer . He steals the picture in his short time in front of the camera . Mr Steiger brings a different concept to this officer ; he stands out against all the other people around him . What a presence he had ! In contrast with Mr . Cooper's stoic presence , Mr . Steiger was ready to smolder the screen if given the chance . The rest of the cast is outstanding . Charles Bickford , Ralph Bellamy , Elizabeth Montgomery , Jack Lord , James Daly , Fred Clark , among others , enhance this movie . The only problem with the copy I saw , is the horrible coloring that tends to give a fading images . This is a film in need of restoration .


Text2: The prodigal daughter After an absence of many years , Tieta , who is now in her forties , returns to Santa Ana as a rich woman , the envy of the town . Tieta has a mysterious aura about her , that no one , even her father and sister , can't imagine where her wealth comes from . Of course , having been married to a wealthy man might have been one scenario , but there are many hints pointing about what the nature of her "" business "" is in Sao Paolo . The truth will not be revealed until the end , when Tieta , who has grown restless in the small town , decides to go back where she belongs . The novel by the great Jorge Amado gets a tepid adaptation by director Carlos Diegues . This is his third movie based by the director of Jorge Amado's novels . Diegues was more successful with his earlier films , "" Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos "" and "" Gabriela , Cravo e Canela "" , using the master story teller's texts . In all these films he has been lucky enough to entice the gorgeous Sonia Braga to participate in them . In fact , "" Tieta do Agreste "" kept reminding us of Frederich Durrenmatt's "" The Visit "" because in both a rich woman , who has been wronged in the past , come home to deal with the town and the people that were cruel to them , but that's where all the similarities end . In the German version , Karla deals with her past in a vengeful way , whereas in the Brazil of Jorge Amado , Tieta has a different approach . Sonia Braga's Tieta is full of fire , and for being in her forties , at the time she made the film , she shows quite a figure as the sultry creature who discovers a few things about herself , her family , and the town in which she was banished from by her heartless father . When she needed compassion , Tieta , got none . Her revenge is that she became rich and now she is in a position to help the backward Northeast town to get the electricity it badly needs . In the process , she falls in love with a younger man who betrays her . Tieta deals with her pious sister who only cares for the money she can get for herself and her son . Carlos Diegues got excellent performances from this talented cast . Marilia Pera , who plays Perpetua , Tieta's sister makes an excellent contribution to the film . Claudia Abreu , is another good actress that makes a good appearance in the film as Leonora , Tieta's step-daughter . The rest , Chico Anysis , Zeze Notta , Leon Gomes , among others , make a great contribution . We read recently that Ms . Braga had returned home from her prolonged stay in the U . S . , as she felt Hollywood , in general , had not been too kind to her lately . Ms . Braga deserves vehicles like "" Tieta do Agreste "" in which to shine . One could only hope her collaborations with Brazilian directors like Carlos Diegues will produce many more happy collaborations for our benefit .

Text2: Twisted In one of his last silent films , Lon Chaney plays a magician who went into a kind of exile in the Belgian Congo after a fight with a man who stole his wife left him a cripple . He's now known as ' Deadlegs ' and he's used his mastery of prestidigitation to make himself the local kingpin in his neck of the jungle . But even he has to obey certain native customs . He's an embittered and twisted man who has worked out a most carefully engineered scheme involving his late wife's daughter . The man who did steal his wife , Lionel Barrymore is now also in Africa . He contrives to bring the two of them together and both kill and degrade them at the same time at the hands of the cannibals he lives with . Even with this Victorian plot and given the racism of the times , in Victorian Great Britain they would not have had cannibals in Africa because there were no cannibals in Africa . But what did Americans know about Africa ? Still Chaney gives a compelling performance and the role calls for the make up and the contortion that he was known for . In fact in James Cagney's film biography of Chaney there are small portraits of Chaney's various screen roles and West of Zanzibar is one of them . Also look for a good performance by Warner Baxter as the alcoholic doctor who Chaney keeps on a kind of retainer . It's not a great film , far from it , but it is a fascinating look at the life and art of Lon Chaney .

Text2: The Man With The Deadly Stick This episode gave British viewers an early sighting of Felicity Kendal ( billed as ' Kendall ' ) , then aged 20 . As one of the millions of males who lusted after her when she scrubbed fireplaces in ' The Good Life ' , I have no hesitation in listing this among my favourite ' Suitcase ' adventures , and not just because of her . It was penned by Victor Canning , author of spy thrillers such as ' The Limbo Line ' and ' Castle Minerva ' . Kendal plays ' Marcelle Robart ' , a young , blind Frenchwoman , something of a recluse . In the teaser , she reads aloud from a Braille book , before hearing heavy footsteps on the stairs . The parrots shriek in their cages . An unknown intruder murders her stepmother ( Gillian Lind ) , and makes off with her jewellery . Noticing an ad in a local paper requesting information about the murder , McGill offers to take on the case . He is warned off by both the police and Henri Thibaud ( Marius Goring ) . Marcelle's only contact with the outside world comes with the special concerts she holds for her blind friends each month . Presents are given out . What she does not know is that they contain not soap , tobacco or chocolates but narcotics . . . As the blind girl , Felicity is terrific , both innocent and attractive . Marcelle's initial distrust of McGill soon turns to something resembling affection , though it is never overtly stated whether or not it has progressed beyond the platonic . Marius Goring , a marvellous character actor , played ' The Expert ' in the B . B . C . series of that name ( a British version of ' Quincey M . E . ' ) , and makes a suitably flamboyant villain , equipped with a cane that doubles as a shotgun . Keith Marsh , who plays ' Leon ' , is best known for comedy roles such as ' Jacko ' in ' Love Thy Neighbour ' . Michael Bates , future star ' Last Of The Summer Wine ' and ' It Ain't Half Hot Mum ' pops up briefly as ' Delacroix ' . Jeremy Summers , the director , worked on ' The Saint ' and ' The Baron ' , and directed a number of movies , including the Tony Hancock classic ' The Punch & Judy Man ' . If it strikes you as odd that Madame Robart's murderer chooses not to eliminate Marcelle also ( though blind , she is still capable of identifying the culprit , albeit by his footsteps ) bear in mind that she was crucial to the criminals ' operation . Without her , there would have been no special concerts . In the final scene , she is so horrified at having been exploited by drug dealers she contemplates a return to a life of solitude , but McGill urges her to live life to the full . In contrast to the series ' usual downbeat endings , this one offers hopeful optimism .

Text2: Romeo and Juliet in the Mafia Some parts of this movie have not survived seventy-five years well , and at times the dialogue limps . Robert Young , as the young lover , speaks in a voice that is annoying in the high register . Constance Cummings is a beautiful young woman and a good actor . Boris Karloff handles his rather small role gracefully , with just an air of lurking menace . But it is Leo Carrillo , who begins the movie looking like a buffoon and ends the movie as a terrible monster , who owns this movie . I won't give away any details , but the ending , once you realize its inevitability , is a real shocker . Does Carrillo's performance make the movie worth seeing ? Yes , although just barely , and you may need a bit of patience until the movie is worthwhile , but perhaps the mobile camera-work will keep you interested .

"" Ah , the immortal line from Charles Dickens ' classic , from the book Oliver Twist , telling the story of an orphaned boy , with sheer incredible luck and a melancholic , likable face . The book has been remade into movies countless of times , and this one is Roman Polanski's take . I haven't read the novel ( yes , I heard gasps of horror ) so I can't offer a scene for scene comparison . So perhaps you could shed some light on the short summary I'm about to give . The first 10 minutes will highlight the immortal line where Oliver is sent to a factory made up of orphaned boys . There , he gets sold to a coffin maker , where he makes his escape . Throughout his journeys , he meets up with many benefactors who assist him in one way or another . Some good , like Mr Brownlow , and some bad , like Fagin , who's the caretaker of a group of child pickpockets . And it is in London where Oliver was picked up by the Artful Dodger , and introduced to the rest of the crew led by Fagin . He learns the trade , but in a botched first attempt , gets sort of rescued by Mr Brownlow , and has his first taste of a decent life . However , the lowlifes are afraid of him squealing their whereabouts to the police , and hence , recapture Oliver and uses him to steal from Mr Brownlow . And of course I won't bore you with the details but suffice to say that the main villain of the show , Bill Sykes , an associate of Fagin , gets more screen time than Oliver himself towards the end . It's a lavish production , with big sets . The streets of Old London were beautifully created , and so was the soundtrack chugging so indiscreetly in the background . Ben Kingsley , as Fagin , disappears into his role behind the makeup - you'll hardly recognize him , and Barney Clark as Oliver seemed likable enough too , and provided enough emotions to punctuate the final scene . So for those , like me , who have not read the book , this should prove to be an invaluable 130 minute introduction to the real thing . Sure you can have more , by picking up the book .


Text2: A Nutshell Review : ( SIFF ) Noriko's Dinner Table This Japanese film is my closing film for this year's SIFF . It tells of a compelling family story , where "" safe "" is boring , and a child is off looking for that spark in life to spice things up . Turning her back to her family , Noriko makes her way to Tokyo to look up her internet friends , friends she came to know through an online forum . At first everything seems puzzling , until she realize that they are all "" actors "" , folks providing "" rental family "" services to lonely people out there , yearning to belong . It's ironic that Noriko had turned her back on her real family , only to join a surrogate one , pretending to be close knit to a lot of other strangers . She takes on her online persona , and forgets about "" Noriko "" , the life she left behind . Which makes it really strange - why would anyone want to abandon their own family , and comfort zone , to make believe with others ? It's a social exploration of alienation , and on a separate note , tries to look at the trend of suicide clubs in Japan . One harrowing scene that was replayed , was that of 54 female students jumping off a train platform in unison . Taking on pseudo-security camera views , and plenty of blood with the smashing of heads on track ( in full glory ) , it'll make you wince , yet wonder in astonishment , the question of Why . √üRunning parallel to Noriko's narrative , are a few others , like her dad's , her sister Yuka's ( who also joined Noriko in her new role ) , and a forum founder Komiko . Taking on parallel and different points of view , it is no wonder that this film clocks in at slightly more than 2 hours . The father seeks Noriko and Yuka and wants to start afresh by welcoming them home , but find that the siblings have already disowned their lives thus far , preferring to pretend to be someone else , someone they have total control over , someone that they have created for themselves . The movie started off strongly , but the pace sagged around the half way mark , before picking up again for the grand finale . It also helped that almost all the female cast in this movie are eye-candy , contrasting the seriousness of the issues presented , with their outward cuteness and pretty faces . It's a pretty weird story , with strange characters , those who don't bat an eyelid over suicide , taking it as a form of higher calling . However you'll still be stuck at the Why question , as the movie doesn't offer any concrete answers , and somehow teased with an ending hinting of a possible sequel , that probably wouldn't be made .

I was wondering for days how they created these special effects in 1932 . But they aren't special effects - I couldn't accept that at the time . I see it now as one of the greatest horror films ever made , and not because the "" freaks "" are horrific . It's Tod Browning's amazing direction - possibly his greatest effort - that makes the film so frightening . The wedding feast is one of the great set pieces in film history .

604,"Text1: Lennon the peacenik vs Nixon the warmonger paranoid ; a bout that's given good , not great , treatment here The central premise of The US vs John Lennon ( the latter as described in the Departed , of all movies , semi-sarcastically as "" the president before Lincoln "" ) is that public figures are always up for grabs if they come out on either side of the fence . Lennon was fervently anti-war - if very unsure about going all the way into the dangerous political zone ( hence not going , wisely enough , to the violent demonstration that happened at the 1972 Republican convention ) - and because of his connection with various people like Jerry Rubin and Abby Hoffmann , as well as questionable ties with the Black Panthers , he was monitored openly , and threatened with deportation for a bogus pot arrest in 1968 . Nixon , meanwhile , was one of the all-time nut-job presidents when it came to the military , who ran in 68 on an "" I'll-end-the-war-honorably "" ticket and instead kept the war going for years , including invading Cambodia . Many of the facts brought up in this documentary aren't new , especially to those who were alive during the time it happened and the media went all over Lennon ( so it goes in today's tabloids as well , only here it was some kind of real news ) . But they are presented compelling enough so that they can offer up some bits of insights for newer audiences to Lennon's music and politics . To be sure , it is a slanted argument , but slanted for the right reasons ( you're bound to not find anyone in a doc like this saying "" oh , Vietnam , not so bad "" , unless maybe Liddy ) . Yet the argument holds strong throughout , about the nature of political practice and the ideals of changing things not going well with the establishment . And there are questions raised for the audience , if not directly : should Lennon , who technically wasn't American , be apart of a movement that was going on , or just stuck to doing his songs and music ? ( The filmmakers , by the way , wisely cut out much at all to do with the Beatles , albeit they kind of skirmish past the whole issue of "" Beatles bigger than Jesus "" when it's presented more as a footnote of the outspoken side of Lennon than connecting to the main focus ) . It's interesting though to see the footage of the "" bed-in "" , when Lennon and Ono did almost a kind of tour of protest-by-lethargy , and had the press in there as part of the ironic-not-quite-joke of the matter . And there's also fascination in seeing Lennon describe , candidly in archival interviews , the toll the media blitz and upheaval from the government had on him . Only towards the end do the directors start to waver the attention a little bit , even as it is , to be sure , part of the story of Lennon and his eventual tragic death in 1980 . But the core idea behind the documentary is one that will always pose something that the viewer should look for : what is it about two unlikely connected figures - popular celebrity musician-cum-activist and one of the craziest presidents this country ever had - that still seems relevant today ? Can people take away anything from Lennon's struggle with the powers-that-be ? It might be a little obvious ( i . e . getting past apathetic stances and doing nothing to just trying to do ' something ' ) , but the point is made nonetheless in the film , and not in a manner that is too schmaltzy or heavy-handed . Just make sure you don't have a BS drug bust to worry about .


Text2: like its predecessor , it's about a certain cross-hair of a particular music scene at the time I'll admit right off the bat that I didn't respond as strongly to the Decline of Western Civilization 2 : the Metal Years as I did to Penelope Spheeris's first film and documentary , even as I know I did like this film . The former was a kind of fly-on-the-wall ( as I recall , not as many direct interviews , more concert footage ) look at this way of rock and roll life - of LA punks - that Spheeris knew intrinsically . In the Metal Years , she here isn't as much a fly on the wall in the sense of just getting the pure feeling of these people as she is getting answers to questions by a mix of highly popular and working-the-bottom bunch of Metal rockers . It of course can't cover everything in such an amount of time , and one might be slightly disappointed to see Britain's metal scene is sort of overlooked in the course of the film ( not that it isn't represented in interviews with Ozzy and Lemmy , but Maiden and Priest fans , among others , may wonder wtf ) . But if there is any single strength to this seemingly longer-than-90 minute film , with the interviews strung together in a interesting fashion alongside the concert footage , it's that this particular scene of American metal - particularly LA metal's scene - is captured very well . And in this capturing of this time and place and the people all abound in it , it's of course of note to mention that everything the musicians say is not 100 % reliable , and here and there it definitely has the feeling of bullsing with Spheeris's questions ( however clever and funny ) . But there are enough true moments to really get the sense of these people at the time , that there is maybe at least some depth to the members of Poison ( with really one good song in my opinion ) , or that Ozzy does have a very clear and honest view of what's gone on with him and the scene , or what rock means or drugs mean or sex . If there isn't always a focus in the line of questioning , or if there doesn't seem to be much of a structure to the film , maybe it's part of the point . Here we have a mix of rockers either trying to make it ( Odin , who I think made it bigger since , are featured prominently , as well as London ) , or have made it ( Aerosmith , Kiss , Megadeth and Alice Cooper among a couple others ) , and be it that a scene or two is staged or set up at a location for a desired effect , there aren't many punches pulled with the answers to the fairly straightforward questions . And some of them , when not all about "" rock and roll is my life "" does show the dark side quite accurately , especially considering the time period . One interview with the drunk in the pool gives the most to try and shake off , even as the manipulation of the filmmaker kind of kicks in with having his mother right there watching him in his over-drunk state . But , it is at the end of the day an entertaining documentary , if only as being a fan of the sub-fold of music myself . Some of the concert footage is less than great , even as London and of course Megadeth give quality performances . There was , like with other good documentaries , enough talk coming out of people to really chew on , and it shows Spheeris in a sort of different direction than in the other look at life in underground rock and roll . It's not great , but for the fans of the bands & / or those interviewed , it is near essential viewing , and also with an anthropological side to it through the stories and Q & A's that work for those not as into the music .

605,"Text1: Merle is effective in a weepie from the Golden Age . . . Handsomely photographed and nicely scored romantic drama from Samuel Goldwyn about a childhood friendship between three people that develops into an intense romantic triangle . MERLE OBERON , FREDRIC MARCH and HERBERT MARSHALL have the pivotal roles as star-crossed lovers during the World War I period . Unfortunately , the three leads are lifelong friends destined to have their lives shattered by the war . Love , guilt and fate play a part in their lives when March is blinded but keeps away from Oberon , unable to tell her the truth and letting her think he's died . As for the rest of the plot , with a screenplay by Lillian Hellman , you have to watch the film . Nobody stumbles in any of the roles and , in fact , MERLE OBERON won her only Best Actress nomination as Kitty , warm and appealing as the romantic interest of both men . The tearful final reunion scene will remind you of the final touching scene from RANDOM HARVEST where Smitty and his lost love find each other again . Modern viewers beware . You'll probably find some of the tear-jerking moments a bit too mawkish but remember , this was the 1930s . Trivia note : Oberon was photographed much more flatteringly in another film she appeared in that year , THE SCARLET PIMPERNELL . What a difference a more flattering hairdo and period costumes make ! !


Text2: Very good concert performance This concert tribute to the late Freddie Mercury ( frontmen of legendary UK rock band QUEEN ) is a great performance . There are so many guest appearances , including Elton John , Def Leppard and Axl Rose . There are many musical performances , but the most popular - - and best - - has to be the reinterpretation of Queen's most famous song , Bohemian Rhapsody , which is performed here by Elton John and Axl Rose . It's a great performance , a great song - - and it sounds ( arguably ) even better with John and Rose singing it . ( Although Queen fans may disagree on that one . ) Overall this is a great performance and everyone involved is giving 100 % . And for the record , I absolutely loved the performance of We Will Rock You , which is probably the second best song here - and it's really well performed . Worth watching .

This is about a group of crippled and disfigured individuals who are part of a activist group that lashes out at the "" beautiful people "" of the world . Now they've decided to kidnap the daughter of a rich man , and infiltrate the wedding with hilarious results , like they won't stand out ? There are Siamese twins , a hunchback dwarf , a man with the lowest IQ known , etc . The wedding scene is perhaps the most frenetic with old 60's pop tunes updated , Spanish style , like "" Judy in Disguise With Glasses "" . Once the bride to be has been kidnapped the group takes off for outer space and the idea is to meet at some bar on some planet to exchange the hostage for a questionable sum of money , as in , the leader told his gang one amount but the TV said another , HIGHER amount , so after that treachery and greed set in and one by one , the group is being killed off . What does one do when their Siamese twin is killed because ( as the killer says ) he was plotting against you ? Why , drag him around with you , of course . Good taste and political correctness is never an issue in this film , as they're never present , but that's most of the fun of the movie . The sort of bad news is , that this DVD is presented in ' wide screen ' , which in this case is merely a stripe on the TV screen , though , and things move so fast it's not easy to keep up with the subtitles and watch the action too . And this does bear watching , it's just too bad it wasn't given a better treatment for DVD . But the film itself is a twisted little gem , and if you enjoy black comedy mixed with science fiction you'll probably like it a lot . So why isn't "" Day of the Beast "" on DVD ? .

If you like that kind of stuff then it may excite you , but it's thankfully brief ( no pun intended ) and probably more creepy than the rest of the film . The story is , that 3 brothers have gone to the circus , on the night that 3 escaped lunatics invade the circus clown's changing tent & assume their identities . And , since young Casey has a morbid fear of clowns , well , they seem to latch on to him . The oldest brother is played by a very young Sam Rockwell , I wouldn't have known it had it not been in the credits . The role of the "" evil "" Cheezo the Clown is played by wacko comedian Tree , whose stand-up act I saw on TV once , wow , was he a good choice to play a lunatic clown . Although , of course , he doesn't speak . The creepy clowns are good , and the creepy clowns stalking three kids left on their own in a big house are good , but the kids are so unlikeable that you hope the clowns DO get them . And because the kids are unlikeable , the film fell flat , for me .

Text2: They Won't Take THIS Away From Me This is undoubtedly one of the best that Fred and Giner made at RKO in glorious black and white and it's singular inasmuch that one is able to wallow in the melodic melodies and literate lyrics whilst simultaneously marvelling at what Depression audiences would sit still for in terms of credibility . All three writers - Lee Loeb , Harold Buchman ' story ' and Ernest Pagano ' screenplay ' - racked up dozens of other credits - Pagano worked on four other Astaire movies , Carefree , again with Ginger , A Damsel In Distress , You Were Never Lovlier and You'll Never Get Rich - and presumably wrote all five screenplays in the same colander . Consider : The story opens in Paris ; Astaire , dancing star of a Russian ballet troupe , is happy to stay there where he hopes to meet Linda Keene ( Rogers ) an American entertainer with whom he has fallen in love . Impresario Jeffrey Baird ( Edward Everett Horton ) wants Petrov ( Astaire ) to return to New York and dance at the Met but Petrov is adamant . Then , he meets Keene and learns she is sailing the very next day ( from Paris , mind you , on a Liner , yet ) on the Queen Ann so without further ado he informs Baird that he ( Petrov ) will sail to NY the next day . Just like that . No advance booking necessary , just turn up with your troupe of Russian dancers and yes , of course , you can have a couple of dozen staterooms at a couple of hours notice . More ? Halfway across the Atlantic , Ginger , teed off with Fred , persuades the captain to allow her to leave on the plane that comes to collect air mail for New York . Yes , you heard . A plane lands on a liner in the middle of the Atlantic as a matter of course to collect mail . More ? Gee , you're tough to please , but okay . The first real song and dance number occurs in the engine room of the ship and this is an engine room where you could eat off the highly POLISHED floor even as you marvel at the pristine art-deco pistons and other paraphernalia .

608,"Text1: Sean S . Cunningham graduates from slasher horror to suspense . In a move that I'm sure he made to gain himself some credibility , as well as have some mainstream success , Cunningham made this failed adaptation of the Mary Higgins Clark novel ( scripted by Earl Mac Rauch ( "" The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai in the Eighth Dimension "" ) and "" Friday the 13th "" screenwriter Victor Miller ) . Truly nasty psycho villain Artie Taggart ( Rip Torn , whose natural flamboyance serves him well here ) kidnaps traumatized child Julie Peterson ( Shawn von Schreiber ) and TV newswoman Sharon Martin ( Kate Mulgrew ) , holding them for ransom in a filthy room among the other unsavory locations beneath Grand Central Station . The performances are enough to make it above average ( save for von Schreiber , who unfortunately isn't enough of an actress to make Julie more sympathetic ) , as well as Cunningham's effort to make this more of a traditional suspense film . He actually refrains from throwing blood in the viewer's face ; even when a murder is violent , it is implied more than shown . The "" big "" plot twist at about the 67-minute mark probably wouldn't come as a surprise to most people . Cunningham uses two of the same crew from "" Friday "" - art director Virginia Field and cinematographer Barry Abrams - and his wife Susan is the editor . Son Noel has a bit part . Look for small roles for character actor / acting teacher William Hickey - he of that raspy , sing-song voice - as a bum who's only around long enough to insult Torn and get himself killed - and Vincent Spano , who can be seen as a gas thief .


Text2: Saw the premiere with Kitty Carlisle and Scott Barton This film had been thought of as lost for about half a century when apparently Kathryn Crosby must have been rummaging through some closets and announced that Bing had a copy of this formerly lost film of his . It was restored and back in the early 1990s I saw the newly restored version with my friend Scott Barton and hosting the film was its co-star , Kitty Carlisle . It was a great afternoon . And the film was well worth saving . Songwriters Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger gave Crosby , It's June In January and With Every Breath I Take to sing and Robin teamed up with Lewis Gensler for Love Is Just Around the Corner . All three songs were good selling records for Bing and a particular favorite of mine has always been With Every Breath I Take . He sang these a few times during the film both solo and as duets with Carlisle . The records incidentally were the first movie songs and almost the first songs Crosby recorded for the brand new Decca record label . Although Decca signed many artists , Crosby was their number one artist for 20 years . Decca and Crosby were virtually synonymous . No acting stretch here in terms of character . Crosby plays a rich crooner . Jokes about his wealth were a staple in Bob Hope's repertoire , although Hope did pretty good in that department as well . In 1934 Crosby was accumulating his fortune , but he wasn't near the point where as Hope once said , "" he doesn't pay taxes , he just calls up the Treasury and asks how much they need . "" Like many rich people and some not so rich Bing was collecting his toys in this film and he had one pistol in a matched set of dueling pistols that once belonged to John Paul Jones . Bing wants to get the set and donate them to the Naval Academy . Problem is that the other one belongs to Kitty Carlisle who is an exiled Russian princess living in Monte Carlo with her retinue which consists of Roland Young , Alison Skipworth and Reginald Owen . Essentially these people live off her selling her possessions and they're getting fewer and fewer . So Bing goes off to Monte Carlo meets Carlisle and the fun begins . A standard criticism I have of Crosby's films is that Paramount shot them on the cheap , especially his musical numbers . It would have been great if Paramount had actually shot the thing in Monte Carlo , but to be fair , no studio in Hollywood would have gone those lengths in 1934 . Twenty years later Paramount did go to Monte Carlo for a movie and the result was To Catch A Thief . Here Is My Hear would have been as special as that film had they done that and with color to boot . This was also the first film Crosby did with William Frawley who appeared in several of his films . Frawley was one of film land's great misanthropic alcoholics and by all accounts not a nice man to know . Crosby and a lot of Hollywood gave up on him , until Desi Arnaz saved him from oblivion and gave him a fresh career as Fred Mertz . Kitty Carlisle said that Crosby was a difficult man to know for her . He came to the studio , did his business and left . If he had his druthers , Bing would have been out on the golf course . But she enjoyed the two films she did with him . When I saw Here Is My Heart it was playing with Murder At the Vanities and she had not much good to say about her leading man Carl Brisson in that one . One ironic tragedy . The film centered around Crosby trying to acquire antique dueling pistols . Crosby's crooning rival Russ Columbo was killed by an antique dueling pistol that summer around the time Here Is My Heart would have been in the theaters . A year before Columbo had visited Bing on the set of We're Not Dressing where Crosby's co - star was Carole Lombard who was linked to Columbo at the time . Here Is My Heart was well worth saving . I guess we should all be grateful to Kathryn Crosby for doing her spring cleaning .

Text2: Take me to your lederhosen ' Ferien vom Ich ' ( ' Holiday from Myself ' ) is a weak film , although there are some pleasant exterior shots of the Bavarian countryside . The most interesting thing about this film is that it was made in Germany during the very early days of Hitler's premiership - - before the Third Reich caused most of its unpleasantries - - and , as such , it provides an interesting example of the German perception of Americans before WW2 compelled all loyal Nazis to see Americans as the enemy . It also provides some interesting depictions of mental illness , a few years before Hitler's propaganda machine encouraged the euthanasia of all mentally-ill German citizens for the ' greater good ' of the Herrenvolk . Hermann Braun plays a workaholic American industrialist whose physician ( Georg H Schnell ) orders him to go away for a rest cure to someplace where nobody knows him . Naturally , he chooses Bavaria . Rather than check into an existing spa , Braun buys the estate of an impoverished nobleman ( Friedrich Stampe ) . He then proceeds to tear most of it down and rebuild it from scratch as a sanitarium . After all this is done , and the sanitarium has been freshly stocked with patients , Braun shows up and checks himself in for a rest cure without revealing his true identity ( of course ) . SPOILERS COMING . At the sanitarium , he meets the beautiful young daughter ( Carola H√∂hn ) of the nobleman whose estate he's gutted . Naturally , she depises the millionaire . Naturally , she also falls in love with the sanitarium's new American patient . . . not realising that they're both the same man . Boring and unfunny complications ensue . Sadly , the other patients in the sanitarium are rather broad caricatures of mental patients : they act like the inmates in the old burlesque sketch ' Crazy House ' . They're clearly meant to be funny , yet I couldn't help recalling that - - soon after this film was made - - Hitler and Goering would urge the ' mercy killing ' of all mentally-disturbed or feeble-minded German citizens . As Germany and the United States were not yet at war in 1934 - - and , indeed , many American citizens ( especially German-Americans ) openly sympathised with Hitler's plans for Germany - - it's intriguing to see that this film's depiction of its American protagonist is entirely favourable and even admiring . It's clear that , at this date , Germans still admired Americans for their drive and optimism . When did things change ? I'll rate this mildly amusing movie , mostly for its historic aspects .

613,"Text1: Goldilocks At Graveside Irwin Shaw settled in Paris in 1951 and remained based there for two decades and it's fun to speculate that he saw this movie there and found the concept - during a funeral five people , the wife , son , daughter , mistress and a business associate of the deceased give their respective takes on his life - sufficiently interesting to borrow the opening for one of his finer late stories , Goldilocks At Graveside , published in his collection Love On A Dark Street in the mid 1960s . For that matter Joe Mankiewicz possibly borrowed the same motif for The Barefoot Contessa , released one year later than Bon Dieu . Arguably the opening are all the three have in common ; the dead man in Shaw's tale was a promising State Department official whose career was destroyed by the eponymous Goldilocks and lived out his life in obscurity , the shoeless aristocrat was a major film actress and Monsieur Dupont was a small-time business man . Autant-Lara ignores the rules of flashback and the film is stronger for it and if Danielle Darrieux as the mistress gets as much screen time as the wife , son , daughter and business associate put together by virtue of her star status this is not necessarily a bad thing given that Darrieux is the kind of actress the camera loves and riveting to watch . Autant-Lara extracts marvellous performances from the entire cast including Claude Berri and Julien Carette in relatively small roles and an Award winning one from his leading man . Released some five years before the new wavelet began lapping the feet of the Titans of French cinema the quality on display here makes one wonder just what Truffaut and his ilk found to cry about .

Once Danny is "" unleashed "" ( literally ) he's a killer and helps the gangster Bart in his criminal work .

In the meantime , however , Danny escapes his captors and winds up at the house of an older blind American , "" Sam , "" played by Morgan Freeman . He and his 18-year-old daughter "" Natalie "" ( Kelly Condon ) befriend young Danny , slowly bringing him out of his "" animal "" state . Everyone discovers Danny has some very human characteristics and is basically a nice , gentle guy . The family helps uncover that through music ( piano playing , to be exact ) . These are all touching scenes .

615,"Text1: "" If I don't kill this buffalo , the dream will kill me . "" Although the story had a number of ideas that didn't ring true for me , I still found it largely entertaining and interesting . Of course , having Wild Bill Hickok cross paths with Crazy Horse was one of the more creative elements in the picture , and that they didn't recognize each other was probably something of a stretch . In fact , having very few people recognize Hickok on his return from Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show was probably darn near impossible . I'm going by Hickok's reputation and the fact that his image would have been one of the more prominent ones featured in newspapers and dime novels of the day . But as far as fiction goes , this one gets points for the idea of a mythical white buffalo that haunts Hickok's nightmares and has caused Crazy Horse disgrace following the death of his daughter . Both have their reasons for revenge on the ' buff ' , and the events leading to their team up is handled skillfully . You know , if I hadn't seen Clint Walker's name in the opening credits and been looking for him , I probably would have entirely overlooked his presence as Whistling Jack Kileen . He's one guy who never seemed to age following that successful run as Cheyenne Bodie in the 1950's . He's a bad guy here though , virtually unrecognizable under a beard and a brogue , but I don't think he ever did whistle . If you listen closely , you might be shocked to hear Charlie Zane's ( Jack Warden ) comment the first time he and Wild Bill get a look at Crazy Horse before they know who he is . Under attack by a band of Crow Indians , Charlie says - "" Look at that red nig-er take on "" . The only other time I've heard that reference in a movie before was in 1960's "" The Unforgiven "" in a similar context . Interesting but disconcerting to hear a racist remark like that regarding Native Americans . For Western movie fans , the picture offers quite a notable cast heading off into their own personal career sunset , folks like Slim Pickens as a stage driver and John Carradine as a busy undertaker . Both have rather brief roles , along with Kim Novak as a former Hickok flame , Poker Jenny . Speaking for myself , it's always a treat to catch Will Sampson in any kind of role ; my favorite has to be his portrayal of Chief Bromden in "" One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest "" . Fans of Charles Bronson should be pleased with his effort here , about mid-way between his "" Death Wish "" appearances . Somewhat less charismatic is the white buffalo itself , a rather modest special effects effort even by 1970's standards . At times it looks more comical than fearsome , and I had to ask myself why they couldn't come up with something a bit more realistic looking , especially considering it had the power to wipe out Indian villages and knock down mountains .


Text2: "" Rise Sir Lancelot , my champion ! "" I've never been a fan of the medieval knight genre , and this one manages to reinforce my feelings . I just couldn't tell what they were going for in the story , and abrupt scene changes often occurred on a dime with no time at all allotted for the transition . Like early in the picture with news of King Leodogran's challenge to Arthur for each of their champions to meet in duel to decide Arthur's status as King . No sooner said than done , Sir Lancelot ( Cornel Wilde ) is atop a horse and going hell bent for leather against Sir Dorjak . Others on this board have mentioned the ages of the principals , something I wondered about myself . It was a little hard to fathom Lady Guinevere ( Jean Wallace ) looking her true age representing a King's daughter about to be betrothed . Kind of makes you glad they had that magic soap around . The one thing the film had going for it was the realistic battle scenes , with body blows taking on a gruesome countenance . The scene where Lancelot separates a warrior's shoulder was particularly graphic . At the same time though , my earlier comment applies as well to the final epic battle . At one point we see Lancelot right in the thick of things swinging away with his sword , and a minute later he's perusing the battle field from a distant vantage point as different sets of warriors enter the fray ; it almost looked like there were more than two fronts to the battle . And say , what accent was Cornel Wilde going for ? His character was French , but he sounded more like Russian to me . That is , when he wasn't sounding like something else altogether . I don't know , the picture just didn't do it for me , and with all that went before to test the mettle of the besieged lovers , Guinevere becomes a nun ? Her speech might have been noble but not very convincing . Alas poor Lancelot , as capable as he was on the battlefield , this was one blow he never saw coming .

Text2: Dumb , brainless action but fun in a way This movie only lasts for barely 89 minutes . This makes me wonder if anything was cut out of the movie in the editing room . I think there was when I watch the film . It could have been so much more . What's left is a very brief and entertaining movie about a prison break . With very little Firestorm . Many people have said that Howie Long's performance in this film is quite poor . I think that he did a fine job . I can honestly say his performance is totally adequate . William Forsythe is quite a decent villain too . Neither hammy nor campy . I'm glad he was in the movie . But I'm not glad the film was a flop . It would have been a big hit if it was longer and had more plot . You can't call a film FIRESTORM and have only a few seconds worth of fire in it . I don't know what has been cut from this film but it has damaged it severely . Chris Soth is the only person credited with writing this film but rumor has it that Graeme Yost actually wrote the first draft but used his affiliation with the of the WGA to take if off after they hashed his script around too much . Although it is bare-boned and anorexic it is still a cool film to watch .

I never really wanted to get into it , I mean , I was a kid after all . But a few years ago in my film appreciation class , we were watching clips from Mad Max 2 when studying Australian films and I was intrigued with it . I finally remembered a few weeks ago how I wanted to see the three movies , so I just watched Mad Max and I have to say that I understand it's cult following . Mad Max promises and delivers , it's a low budget action film , but has a terrific story and excellent stunts . Mel Gibson , before he was Mel Gibson in Hollywood , you could see why he made it so big , his presence on screen is truly hypnotic and he makes a great hero . This story is so scary in the fact that I don't think that we are far from this future . Max Rockatansky lives in a time where his country has been taken over by violent , vicious motorcycle gang members who just go around torturing and killing people . Max and a few friends are the last members of the "" semi "" police force that is trying to get things back under control and bring some peace to their town . But when the gang messes with Max's friend by nearly burning him alive , Max is ticked and goes after them . But when the gang messes with Max's wife and child and kills them , oh , they've gone too far and now it's personal . Mad Max's plot is basic and can be considered typical , but it's a fun action movie that truly delivers . The action sequences were really exciting , especially Max's revenge sequence , he was so amazing and I don't remember the last time I rooted so hard for the good guy to win . Mel Gibson was really cool and I had a good time watching Mad Max . I'm looking forward to the sequels . I would recommend this movie for a watch , it's a fun cult classic that I'm sure any action fan would enjoy .


Text2: "" When hoss thieves hear me comin ' , they march right up with a rope around their neck ! "" I got a kick out of this Roy Rogers film , and mostly for elements not even connected to the story per se . For example , the name of Buzz Henry's character in the picture goes by Bobby Blake , and I thought to myself , wouldn't it have been cool if the REAL Bobby Blake ( Robert Blake , that is ) was cast as a character with his own name ? It would have been possible too , since the young Buzz Henry was eleven years old when he appeared in the picture . At the time , Blake ( the real one ) would have been nine , so it probably wouldn't have been too much of a stretch to make that happen . Instead , Blake ( the real one ) made his mark in Westerns as Red Ryder's sidekick in the series of movies that started with "" Riders of Death Valley "" in 1944 ; Blake was Ryder's sidekick Little Beaver . Then there's Roy Rogers ' title song that's first heard as a recording when Bobby spins a couple of tunes on his record player . I thought that was pretty unique , at least it was the first time I'd seen that done to introduce the lead player . Rogers himself doesn't appear for a few more scenes , so that was a cool way to get his presence into the movie a bit earlier . A good deal of the fun in this one is provided by a running feud between Gabby Hayes and Pat Brady as a member of the Sons of the Pioneers . Each believes the other is deaf based on false information intentionally planted by Roy and Bob Nolan , so they go through the picture shouting at each other in comic fashion . Brady provides some more merriment when he gets to sing lead in a jail house tune later in the story . As for Gabby , he tries hard to build on his reputation as a ' professional rustler catcher ' , even if one wonders how many rustlers there might have been in that hazy modern Western era where 1880's sensibility collides with such technology as automobiles , radio and electrical appliances . The 1940's was a curious time for Westerns as this stuff pops up all the time in the films of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry , but it usually turns out fairly entertaining as it does here . If you hadn't figured it out by now ( unless you've seen the film ) , the story involves a gang of rustlers operating in a milieu where wild herds are being rounded up on reservations and bred with ranch thoroughbreds as part of a government experiment . The rustlers spring into action whenever a particular song is played during the Lariat Lodge entertainment broadcast . Inadvertently , the Pioneers are drawn into this ruse when they perform "" Blue Prairie "" during a one night stand at the Lodge . That actually rounds out another interesting point about the movie's principal players - when introduced , the singing group is introduced as Roy Rogers and the Sons of The Pioneers . I hope Bob Nolan didn't feel too bad about that one !

Well , wouldn't you know it , they start dropping like flies . . . Well , I'm sure other people have said it before me , but any film that kills off George Clooney within the first thirteen minutes bears some looking into . ( I'm not sure that qualifies as a spoiler , his is not even a major character , and he was a newcomer to film back then . ) It doesn't quite seem to be a parody , but more of a tongue-in-cheek horror movie ( I think the more recent film "" Cherry Falls "" would also fall into this small category ) . Reasonably entertaining but no ball of fire , film has appealing leads ( Brendan Hughes , Lori Lethin ) and funny supporting performances by Alex Rocco ( probably the best performance in the film ) as the sleazoid producer and Scott Jacoby as the pretentious director . There's also the prospect of seeing some one-time TV stars in cameos : Maureen McCormick as a police officer who is turned on by gore , and Vince Edwards as a teacher . All in all , not bad .


Text2: Quite a silly movie . Ridiculous but somewhat amusing B horror about anthropology professor Vincent Van Patten , who takes four sorority girls , including squeeze Betsy Russell , into the mountains to look for ancient artifacts . What they find are 1 ) a dopey motorcycle gang and 2 ) a towering , heavily made up druid ( played by seven foot tall Tiny Ron ) looking for human sacrifices . I guess you can't fault a movie too heavily when two minutes in we get shot after shot of bare breasts , as well as shower scenes . Give director Thom Keith credit for that . But the point seems to be to get this sort of thing out of the way so he can concentrate on the main plot of the movie . In any event , it's positively stupid and probably in no way meant to be taken completely seriously . We even get a brief glimpse of a hilarious Loch Ness Monster type creature . What is particularly fun is watching the surviving bikers teaming up with our studly hero to help save the day . Tiny Ron is enjoyable as the grunting and growling antagonist , and it's nice to have Betsy Russell on hand as one of the girls . An undeniable highlight is having scene-stealing , inimitable old pro Buck Flower as a hopeless , disheveled drunk ( often muttering warnings about "" devils and demons "" ) , the kind of role that he could have played in his sleep by this point . I admit that this one was a little hard to stick with ( I could have done without that musical number / dance sequence ) , but it's still fairly enjoyable junk .

Police inspector Eric Visser ( Huub Stapel , with whom director Dick Maas already made the commercial successes "" De Lift "" and "" Flodder "" ) and his team try very hard to catch the killer but he always escapes thanks to his vast knowledge of the canal-network . With "" De Lift "" in 1983 , Maas already proved that he was the only Dutch director of his generation capable of bringing unsettling and tense horror stories , but "" Amsterdamned "" is an even better movie because the atmosphere feels more realistic and the story is a lot more involving . With all the abrupt plot-twists and the extremely violent death-sequences , you could almost describe "" Amsterdamned "" as the only Dutch GIALLO ever made and it's perfectly able to compete with some of the better Italian efforts in this lovely sub genre of horror . Even the chilling musical score ( composed by Dick Maas himself , as well ) feels very giallo-like . Of course , the film isn't entirely flawless . Some action scenes ( like the grotesque speed-boat chase ) are just a tad bit exaggerated and the one many red herrings eventually ruin the credibility . Still , "" Amsterdamned "" unquestionably is one the best Dutch-spoken thriller ever and even horror fanatics across the ocean should consider importing it , if it were only for the nasty and downright shocking scene in which a severely mutilated corpse is dragged over a glass-topped tour boat filled with boy scouts .

It's really too bad they didn't do this in the Revenge . Maybe that would not have equated the proverbial , "" Too Little , Too Late , "" adage . I've always been puzzled as to why they would do this . I mean . . . okay , he's dead , so what can you do ? You can end the franchise on a low note , you can hold a world-wide search for the next Clouseau , you can quietly seek someone to take his place , or you can make a regurgitated piece of crap from the old footage lying on the cutting room floors , slap a new title on it , bring back a few favorites , and call it a day . Obviously , they chose the last one . Bad choice , in my opinion . Actually , even if you're a collector , you can completely dispense with this installment , forget about the deleted scenes , and feel confident that you aren't missing a THING . Although Harvey Korman's performance was hilarious and inspired , it is painfully obvious that NO ONE else cared about this film , including Blake Edwards . It is also painfully obvious this was a clear milking of the franchise fans . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

628,"Text1: Nothing on Silence of the Lambs and the novel it's based on , but a decent thriller in it's own right . After the return of the infamous Hannibal Lecter to our screens in 2001 with Ridley Scott's film version of the best novel in Thomas Harris's Lecter trilogy , it's not surprising that a new version of the first novel in the series got an update a year later considering that it's previous screen version , Michael Mann's Manhunter , doesn't fit in with the other two films in the series . I do have to say that this version is both more true to Harris ' novel and an overall better film than Manhunter ; though it does have numerous shortfalls and has nothing on the masterpiece ' Silence of the Lambs ' . The plot is quite similar to the one in Silence of the Lambs , and features a cop on the hunt of a serial killer and receiving help from the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter . FBI Agent Will Graham , the captor of Hannibal Lecter , is called out of retirement to help catch a serial killer dubbed "" The Tooth Fairy "" by the media . The killer has already slaughtered two families and the FBI believes that another one is soon to join them ; meaning that Will Graham has no choice but to ask Hannibal Lecter for help with the case . The casting is one of the things that many critics pick up on , and that's not surprising . Anthony Hopkins effortlessly slips back into the role that he will always be associated with ; although he's far more comical here than in previous Lecter films . As anyone who has read the book will tell you , Edward Norton is completely wrong for the role of Will Graham as the role needed a grittier actor . Harvey Keitel is a great actor , but Scott Glenn from Silence of the Lambs fit the role of Jack Crawford much better . There's nothing wrong with the rest of the supporting cast , however , with Ralph Fiennes , Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman all fit into their respective roles well . There's not a great deal wrong with the plot pacing , although the film is a little slow at times and the book is much more exciting on the whole . Certain parts of the plot could have been cut out to streamline the film for the screen , although Ted Tally's screenplay is good in that it does encompass most of the important parts of the book . Obviously this film is always going to come under criticism for not being as great as Silence of the Lambs and it does have nothing on the book , but overall Red Dragon is a decent enough thriller in it's own right and I cant say I dislike it .


Text2: A napkin dispenser that knows your future . . . Episodes of The Twilight Zone are always based on intriguing ideas that make you think , and this one takes its plot from the idea of superstitions . Nick of Time was the follow up to the stunning ' Eye of the Beholder ' , and as you might expect ; it can't live up to that episode . However , this tale benefits from its good natured humour and intriguing premise . We follow a honeymooning couple , who have to stop in a small town after their car breaks down . They go for a bite to eat in the local caf√© , and soon become obsessed with the gimmicky napkin dispenser that will predict your future for a penny . When several of its predictions come true . . . they come to believe that there may be more to this item that its gimmicky exterior suggests . This tale is very dialogue based , and most of the plot stems from the chatter between the couple . This dialogue is well written , and the tale constantly pulls you into their plight . Nick of Time then climaxes nicely with a stimulating finale that is typical of Rod Serling's TV show . Sure , it's not the best episode of the series ; but as usual , this tale is well worth 25 minutes of your life .

630,"Text1: Borscht Belt Hoods and Mr . Ryan This is definitely not the greatest film comedy , but it has it's moments . The plot has to do with mob boss Ryan's discovery of a large scale theft of cash that seemed about to be uncovered by his mob's bookkeeper , Bill Dana . Dana is killed in front of Ryan and his right hand gopher Sid Caesar while barbecuing ( somebody tampered with the oil used on the barbecue grill ) . When the discovery is made , Ryan zeroes in on Caesar as the thief , and probable murderer of Dana . Caesar spends the film trying to 1 ) keep out of the hands of Ryan and his goons ( Godfrey Cambridge and Marty Ingalls ) , 2 ) keep out of the hands of the police ( Richard Pryor ) , 3 ) keep his meddlesome mother out of his hair ( Kay Medford ) , 4 ) solve the mystery of the death of Dana and his disappearing corpse , 5 ) find out who , exactly , is trying to frame him , and 6 ) looking after Dana's newly made widow ( Arlene Golonka ) who is looking very appealing to Caesar . Actually the plot fits pretty well , but it is a so-so plot for all that . I think by the time the film is half-way through you will realize who the framer is . But it is the little shticks by borscht belt comics , Caesar , Jan Murray , Cambridge ( with Ingalls ) , Dana ( briefly ) , and with long time comedian Ben Blue and recent arrivals Richard Pryor and Dom DeLuis , that should hold one's attention . Blue is the perennial nervous nelly , a witness against Caesar who is confronted by him ( not threatened by him , mind you , but confronted ) and keeps collapsing in fear of being tortured . As mentioned in another comment on this thread , a woman tries to vamp a dummy that Caesar has left at a bus stop . You have to understand that Caesar introduced her to the dummy as his friend , Matthias Kreplach , who was rich . The woman leaves in a huff when Matthias just won't respond to her chatter - he just sits there like a dummy . I may add that while that scene is good , my favorite moment is the last scene involving Jan Murray and Anne Baxter as a larcenous husband and wife . He gets a final rise out of her that George Sanders did not achieve in ALL ABOUT EVE .


Text2: The Greatest "" Detective "" Novel of All ? Fyodor Dostoeyevski is , without a doubt , one of the greatest novelists of his native Russia , of 19th Century Europe , and of world literature . That said , he is also a pain in the ass to read . If you are into his views of self-sacrifice and mysticism , and of redemption through intense , sometimes meaningless suffering , you can't find anyone else like him . If you also like anti-Western slavophilia , with more than a dollop of anti-Semitism , he's your guy . These aspects appear in his Russian contemporary Tolstoi too , but Count Leo had a more universal view of forgiveness and brotherhood than Fyodor ever had . Therefore Tolstoi makes his occasional snide comments , but they are quickly dropped - not intensively developed . With these serious reservations said , Dostoeyevski remains monumental . Most people recall him for two novels : CRIME AND PUNISHMENT and THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV . Neither of the two novels were ever successfully made into U . S . films , despite a great director in this 1935 version of the former novel , and a grade "" A "" cast and production in the 1958 version of the latter that starred Yul Brynner and Maria Schell . From what I have seen a Masterpiece Theatre version of CRIME AND PUNISHMENT in the 1970s was far closer to the novel than Von Sternberg's 1935 version . But Von Sternberg , working with Columbia Pictures , did not have as good a budget ( and certainly could not make a four hour film ) . CRIME AND PUNISHMENT has been called the first psychological detective novel , and the best . It is not a who-done-it in the spirit of Dashiell Hamnett's THE THIN MAN . It is more like a Columbo episode ( and Columbo's character is obviously modeled on the laid back , wise Detective Inspector Porphiry - who patiently allows Raskolnikov to give himself away and up ) . Dostoeyevski lets us see the killing of the old pawn broker and her sister , and understand the twisted "" philosophical altruism "" that Raskolnikov uses to commit his crime . It is a murder for social purposes - get rid of the leech like money lender / pawn broker , grab her money , and use it to aid those truly unfortunate in society . Had the murder been committed quickly with only the pawn broker killed , the absurd logic might have worked . Instead , because the sister of the victim sees the killing , Raskolnikov has to kill her too for self protection . From that time forward his philosophical base begins to crash . Also he discovers that the material answer of money is not enough to help the poor or those he comes to love . As such CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is ( no real slap at Conan Doyle ) light-years away in effectiveness from THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES . And watching the Russian police procedural in the novel , as Porphiry helps whittle away at Raskolnikov's iron core of beliefs is quite good too . Peter Lorre gives an affecting performance as the killer , one more role in a chain beginning with "" M "" that would continue for much of his admirable career . It must have been well received publicly . The Ritz Brothers spoofed his performance in one of their films . Arnold is fine as Porphiry , who has seen all the murder types ( and can quickly find their weak spot ) . Here , his best moment is when another lesser suspect confesses unexpectedly just as Lorre seemed about to confess . It leaves Porphiry perplexed and troubled , as the confession has been heard by witnesses ( including a smart aleck Lorre ) , and Porphiry realizes an innocent man has possibly put his life in danger by such an act . There are some good supporting touches too , especially seeing Mrs . Patrick Campbell in her last performance on screen as the pawnbroker , a dried up , malevolent figure that one does not waste too much pity on ( again , if she had been the only victim Raskolnikov's philosophical point would have been correct ) . Cuts due to budget and time considerations ruined several parts - Douglas Dumbrille as a married man who wants Lorre's sister ( Lorre can't stand him ) and who helps bring Lorre to book ( for personal reasons ) had a larger part in the novel , including suicide . That is not in the film . With all it's budget restraints though , it is a good","{""output"": ""YES""}"

This film adaptation is a splendid example of bringing American actors like Denzel Washington , Keanu Reeves , Michael Keaton , and Robert Sean Leonard to doing Shakespeare with Kenneth BRanagh , Richard Briers , Emma Thompson and her mother Phyllida Law , KAte Beckinsale , Brian Blessed . This film adaptation is quite lovely to look at in the first place . Everybody is happy and alive in FLorence , Italy . Phyllida and Emma looked tanned and quite happy there . At the time of the film , Emma and Kenneth were married and supposed to be the heirs to Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier . Sadly like them , they both split up after the movie . I suppose it has to do with Ken and Emma's egos or whatever . At that time , I guess we all wanted them to be madly in love . Two attractive and cerebral people like Ken and Emma get together . It was not meant to be I guess in real life . The film is worthy to watch because it's William Shakespeare being silly , witty , and comical rather than tragic and sad . I have to say Emma's mother , Phyllida Law , has become one of the busiest actresses of her age since the 1990s . She works more than her two daughters combined . I look at her and I can see her own talent . She comes quite alive and happy in this film version . Maybe Phyllida will get an O . B . E . someday before Emma . I hope so .


Text2: Take out your handkerchiefs ! I think this film is a very good television movie that did not receive a lot of credit or attention . Interracial romances have always been controversial from L . A . Law to All My Children . Remember Michelle Greene got more hate mail regarding her kiss of African American actor , Blair Underwood , than when she kissed female Amanda Donohoe and that was in the early nineties . Courtney B . Vance plays an African American soldier during World War II who meets and falls in love with Kerry Fox's character , an unhappy wife of a British soldier and mother . The casting is excellent with Ned Beatty and Rolf Saxon reminding the African American soldiers to keep their hands off the British women . I felt this film showed another side of the war . It was just as ugly . The segregation of black and white soldiers is unforgivable part of American history . I disliked the unhappy ending so I gave it a 9 but other than that .

Text2: Historically , the first commercial movie dealing with the colonial war . Claude Berri became famous worldwide with "" Jean de Florette "" and his remake of Pagnol's "" Manon des sources "" but his career had begun long before , in the early sixties when he was lucky to direct the great Michel Simon in "" le vieil homme et l'infant "" ( an old man and a Jewish child during WW2 ) . "" Le pistonn√© "" is no masterpiece but it broke a taboo : never before , a commercial movie had dealt with the colonial war . Some would say there had been Jean-Luc Godard's "" le petit soldat "" , but it was reserved for intellectuals and besides , it did not take place in North Africa . Claude Berri was virtually the first and the true forerunner of Yves Boisset ( "" RAS "" , 1973 ) and Ren√© Vautier ( "" avoir 20 ans dans les Aur√®s "" , 1971 ) . It's the story of a private , who does not feel like going to war , not at all . But duty calls . To avoid it , he tries to get somebody to pull strings for him ( that's what the title means ) . But alas , it will not work . Guy Bedos gives a fine performance as the squaddie , and he is so good we forget he's actually too old for the part . He's given strong support by Georges G√©ret as the warrant officer , a grumpy naive man to whom he makes believe he can bring Brigitte Bardot ( no less ) into the barracks . The second part deals with the war itself ( actually a guerrilla war ) and although it is mainly a comedy , one of the last pictures which shows a maimed soldier who bursts out laughing nervously leaves a bitter taste in the mouth .

She never took much interest so I had a browse myself . While not reading it cover to cover I did read about 100 pages in the middle section of the book just to see if it bore any resemblance to the TV-movie . Yes it does and no is doesn't . If that makes any sense . The characters are there and King's ever-recurring Derry is portrayed effectively enough as a dead-end , horrible town . But like most screen adaptations , it lacks the heavy substance of King's writing . But it would be hard to squeeze in over 1000 pages of story into a movie , even if it is 3 hours long . Split into two halves , the movie begins with the disappearance of a little girl , taken by an evil clown named Pennywise ( a deeply sinister Tim Curry ) . A local librarian recognizes the pattern of the murders and calls each of his friends ( The Lucky Seven / Losers Club ) who helped defeat Pennywise 30 years previously . Pennywise is not bound by the laws of physics and takes on the form of what each of the lucky seven are most afraid of . They find no other appropriate word to describe the phenomena other than IT . We see the backstory to each of them as they suddenly remember events they have mysteriously forgotten . A simple plot device , but effective . It makes the first half stronger than the second . From the 90-minute mark onwards we have a bunch of scared grown-ups who just seem to ask ' What are we going to do ? ' about a zillion times even though as kids they knew exactly what they were doing and were a lot tougher . The ultimate ending is a bit of a let down as it totally erases King's mythology and gives us some lame monster that is nothing compared to Pennywise himself . A helluva lot of King's mystery is simply torn out but IT still has enough energy and intrigue to make a decent stand-alone movie . But after 3 hours , I just wanted a better ending . Director Tommy Lee Wallace did want to shoot in Panavision ( an unusual move for a TV movie ) but the studio wouldn't allow him and so he compromised by shooting in flat 1 . 85 : 1 ( still irregular for 1990 ) . It would have been better to have a scope aspect ratio , especially with 7 characters sometimes occupying the screen at once . But you can blame studio interference for that . An above average TV movie , no doubt . Just loses momentum after the half-way mark and loses points for not sticking closer to King's book .

636,"Text1: A solid modern day made-for-TV Italian crime thriller Back in the late-80s / early-90s , Michele Soavi appeared to be the one of the few bright spots in Italy's struggling film community . But after making Cemetery Man in 1994 , he seemed to have dropped off the face of the Earth . While Uno bianca is the only thing from Soavi that I've seen since his return , he doesn't appear to have lost anything that made him such a promising director . The direction and other technical aspects of the film are nicely done . Soavi obviously knows how to put together a long film and keep it flowing . At 200 minutes in length , Uno bianca is a long film . But not once during the entire runtime did I ever get bored . In fact , I was so entertained that I actually wanted more . While not necessarily groundbreaking , the cinematography and editing provide a lot of interest . There's a definite touch of style running throughout the film that adds much to the enjoyment . Uno bianca is the story of the police's attempt to put a stop to a group of murderous robbers known as the "" Uno Bianca Gang "" . Tired of the ineffective police bureaucracy , Officer Valerio ( Kim Rossi Stuart ) and his partner , Rocco ( Dino Abbrescia ) , decide to take a different approach to put a stop to the gang . By re-interviewing witnesses , wiretapping phones , and setting up video surveillance , Valerio is convinced that he and his partner can discover who is behind the gang and stop their reign of terror . While the plot may sound similar to some the poliziotteschi made in the 70s , Uno bianca is more akin to a police procedural and lacks the over-the-top violence and outrageous plot points often found in those films . The film has more in common with the television show Law & Order than it does some of its Italian predecessors like Almost Human or Syndicate Sadists . Uno bianca is based in reality with real people carrying out a real investigation . That's not to say there aren't scenes of violence and bloodshed , but these moments remain firmly grounding in the real world . A film as long as Uno bianca will only work if the acting is good and believable . Stuart is excellent in the lead role . He has a quiet confidence about him that works . Stuart's Valerio is the kind of character that's easy to believe in and root for . In contrast , Abbrescia plays Rocco a little more laid back and fun-loving . Still , he's no less committed to his job . He's the kind of guy you would like to have for a friend . And finally , Pietro Bontempo is perfect in the role of Michele , the leader of the "" Uno Bianca Gang "" . Botempo gives Michele the intelligence and ruthlessness necessary to head-up a criminal enterprise . Similar to the point I made when discussing the plot , it's the realism these actors give to their characters that helps to make Uno bianca work . Good job , guys !


Text2: I hope Argento finishes the trilogy - As the second movie in Argento's Three Mother's trilogy , it's hard to watch Inferno without comparing it to Suspiria . And that's not really a fair comparison . Inferno has its moments of brilliance . The opening scenes as Rose ( Irene Miracle ) lowers herself into the flooded room are what horror movies are all about . It's easily one of my favorite moments from an Argento film , second only to the opening murder in Suspiria . The atmosphere , tension , and horror are overflowing . The first time I saw the movie , this scene had me literally squirming in my seat . - But Inferno also features what I feel are some of the worst moments to be found in an Argento film . Take the ending as an example . It's a real let down . The entire movie builds to the discovery of the second of the Three Mothers and it's over before it really gets started . Our hero ( Leigh McCloskey ) meets her , she transforms into Death , he runs away , and the building burns - end of movie . This evil creature whom we have waited to see the entire movie does nothing once we finally see her . - The look of Inferno is awesome . Inferno is like Suspiria on steroids . It's real eye-candy for the Argento fan . The use of colors , set direction , and lighting are about the best I've seen . - Keith Emerson's score is adequate . While it lacks some of the punch of a Goblin score , it suits the mood of the film nicely . Most of the acting is also adequate , with Daria Nicolodi's small role being my favorite . It's too bad she wasn't in more of the movie . While McCloskey and Miracle do nothing special , neither is a liability .

He's got a pretty face but not much screen presence . But BLUE VELVET isn't a bad film ( Though it's not as good as its high IMDB rating says it is ) , Lynch doesn't go overboard with his often pretentious style of directing and it's a film that would deserve the oft used tag of "" Hitchcock style thriller "" for the most part , though Dennis Hopper's show stopping performance as the villain is something better suited to a Scorsese picture .

Hackman is really intense in the role and you feel glad that Popeye decided to join the force instead of turning to crime himself . This movie reaches new heights of social realism via Friedkin's directing , it's filmed almost as a documentary with hand held cameras and abrasive jump cuts to other locations . Like I said this must have shocked audiences . . . . . . but only in the 70s . That's the problem with watching THE FRENCH CONNECTION more than 30 years after it was made - we've seen too many similar things in the intervening period . Every cop show as a sort of fascist good guy who would happily torture confessions out of suspects who are always invaribly guilty . When a snitch gives information to Detective Fascist he must be ruffed up a little to keep his cover going . when pursuing a villain Detective Fascist must pursue him in a vast car narrowly missing passers by etc etc . Name every cop show or detective movie and they all have the same type of story That's the main fault of THE FRENCH CONNECTION - it's let far too many genies out of too many bottles , it's been imitated ( Usually in a far inferior manner ) a myriad of times that it seems almost run of the mill now .

It's there where Sydney , Philip Baker Hall , spots this lonely and disheveled young man John , John C . Reily , sitting outside looking as if he needs a meal and a place to stay for the night . In what seems like an act of kindness Sydney offers a startled and confused John not only a cup of coffee and cigarette but also offers to help him make some money at the Reno Casino with this rate card trick that he developed over the years . John who at first thought that the overly friendly Sydney was gay and looking for action , with him , soon realizes that he's genuinely honest in what he's doing . Sydney also agrees to help John pay for his mother's funeral expenses , that amounted to $6 , 000 . 00 , which was the reason he went to Reno and ended up broke , when Sydny found him , playing Black Jack and Roulette . The movie then goes two years into the future where we see John now a "" Big Macher "" - or big shot in Yiddish-at the casino who's now friends with the head of security Jimmy , Samuel L . Jackson . Syndey who's still around helping John out gets very bad vibes as soon as he lays eye on the so sure of himself Jimmy and for good reasons . Jimmy is on to Syndey in what he did in the past and is planning to blackmail him for it ! It's also around this time that John gets involved with casino cocktail waitress Clementine , Gwyneth Paltrow , whom he later marries . It's this combination of characters , Sydney John Jimmy & Clementine , that will set off a series of emotional and even deadly explosions for the remainder of the movie . SPOILER ALERT We later learn what's the reason for Sydney's a strange attraction towards John from his friend Jimmy himself ! Jimmy a cool operator from the east coast , Atlantic City to be exact , has the goods on Sydney and is planing to blackmail him , for $10 , 000 . 00 , in order to keep his mouth shut ! What goods Jimmy has on Sydney has to do with John's late father who was involved with him back east ! Slow moving with almost no action at all , until the last five or so minutes , "" Hard Eight "" or "" Sydney "" is about as good a movie about human relationships and gambling that you'll ever see on the both big and small screen . It's when Sidney is confronted with the truth , by Jimmy , that he's been keeping secret all these years about his past life as a gangster that he's finally forced to resort to violence . Not only in preventing himself from being blackmailed but from preventing his good friend John from knowing the truth about himself and the real reason he feels so obligated to help him ! We soon get to see the reasons why Sydney is what he makes himself out to be , without giving away the reasons for it , in why he goes so far out on a limb to help John and later his newlywed wife Clementine . And the reasons for Sydney doing that are about as honorable and unselfish as they can get !


Text2: like its predecessor , it's about a certain cross-hair of a particular music scene at the time I'll admit right off the bat that I didn't respond as strongly to the Decline of Western Civilization 2 : the Metal Years as I did to Penelope Spheeris's first film and documentary , even as I know I did like this film . The former was a kind of fly-on-the-wall ( as I recall , not as many direct interviews , more concert footage ) look at this way of rock and roll life - of LA punks - that Spheeris knew intrinsically . In the Metal Years , she here isn't as much a fly on the wall in the sense of just getting the pure feeling of these people as she is getting answers to questions by a mix of highly popular and working-the-bottom bunch of Metal rockers . It of course can't cover everything in such an amount of time , and one might be slightly disappointed to see Britain's metal scene is sort of overlooked in the course of the film ( not that it isn't represented in interviews with Ozzy and Lemmy , but Maiden and Priest fans , among others , may wonder wtf ) . But if there is any single strength to this seemingly longer-than-90 minute film , with the interviews strung together in a interesting fashion alongside the concert footage , it's that this particular scene of American metal - particularly LA metal's scene - is captured very well . And in this capturing of this time and place and the people all abound in it , it's of course of note to mention that everything the musicians say is not 100 % reliable , and here and there it definitely has the feeling of bullsing with Spheeris's questions ( however clever and funny ) . But there are enough true moments to really get the sense of these people at the time , that there is maybe at least some depth to the members of Poison ( with really one good song in my opinion ) , or that Ozzy does have a very clear and honest view of what's gone on with him and the scene , or what rock means or drugs mean or sex . If there isn't always a focus in the line of questioning , or if there doesn't seem to be much of a structure to the film , maybe it's part of the point . Here we have a mix of rockers either trying to make it ( Odin , who I think made it bigger since , are featured prominently , as well as London ) , or have made it ( Aerosmith , Kiss , Megadeth and Alice Cooper among a couple others ) , and be it that a scene or two is staged or set up at a location for a desired effect , there aren't many punches pulled with the answers to the fairly straightforward questions . And some of them , when not all about "" rock and roll is my life "" does show the dark side quite accurately , especially considering the time period . One interview with the drunk in the pool gives the most to try and shake off , even as the manipulation of the filmmaker kind of kicks in with having his mother right there watching him in his over-drunk state . But , it is at the end of the day an entertaining documentary , if only as being a fan of the sub-fold of music myself . Some of the concert footage is less than great , even as London and of course Megadeth give quality performances . There was , like with other good documentaries , enough talk coming out of people to really chew on , and it shows Spheeris in a sort of different direction than in the other look at life in underground rock and roll . It's not great , but for the fans of the bands & / or those interviewed , it is near essential viewing , and also with an anthropological side to it through the stories and Q & A's that work for those not as into the music .

The experienced agent Jeanne Vertefeuille ( Joan Plowright ) comes to CIA Headquarters to conduct an investigation of the leak of information . With the collapse of the communist system , Aldrich becomes desperate and commits a final serious mistake . This movie-for-cable-TV is very above the average . The story hooks the attention of the viewer , as well as the performance of Timothy Hutton , Elizabeth Pe√±a and Joan Plowright . The screenplay focuses mostly in the family , the financial problem and the lack of perspective in the career of Aldrich Ames , and the viewer may end the movie with some sympathy for him .

I don't know what it is about Ozon that makes him such a favorite of the Rent-A-Pseud crowd unless it's a penchant for making pretentious garbage masquerading as movies but whatever it is he's at it again . Tedeschi , as always , was worth it , but I wish she wasn't so gullible at selecting directors ; this is twice in two years she's worked with this guy and been the best thing in both films by a country mile . For those who like to know these things it's the second part of a threatened trilogy ( Under The Sand being the first ) and concerns a thirty year old gay photographer with terminal cancer . He has three months to live and it seems as if we spend twice that long watching this . Undoubtedly it will have its supporters but then Bowling For Dollars finds its audience .


Text2: Hoarse Whispers This is the type of film I tend to avoid in the hype of initial release and I haven't felt particularly deprived to miss out on it . It's now been shown on English television and I didn't find it sufficiently mediocre to switch off . Most of the elements are in place , stunning visuals , sentiment , dime-store philosophy plus the obligatory change of attitude in a principal character . Robert Redford - who also helmed - and Kristin Scott Thomas are more or less believable as the mis-matched couple thrown together for a short time in what could be construed as a romantic setting . Dianne Wiest and Chris Cooper weigh in with strong support but Scarlett Johannson was no better as a child than she is as an adult . Interesting rather than memorable .

642,"Text1: Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece . Quentin Tarantino's "" Kill Bill : Vol . 1 "" ( 2003 ) is one of the best movies I have seen this year . Tarantino perfectly mixes beautiful imagery with highly stylized violence . Wonderful Uma Thurman shines as The Bride . She is seeking revenge for horrible atrocities she has suffered at the hand of mysterious Bill . The fight choreography by Yuen Wo Ping is amazing . Still the film is not as violent as some people claim . In actuality , the violence is so cartoonish and over-the-top it can only be seen as amusing . The film is clearly a homage to Japanese samurai cinema , Hong Kong's kung fu movies and Italian spaghetti westerns . I think that Tarantino was inspired by such movies like "" Thriller : A Cruel Picture "" ( 1974 ) , "" Lady Snowblood "" series , "" Sleepy Eyes of Death "" series , "" Shogun Assassin "" ( 1980 ) , "" Battle Royale "" ( 2000 ) plus various Sonny Chiba and Bruce Lee flicks . Anyway , I enjoyed this film and you should too , especially if you're a fan of exploitation cinema .


Text2: The Bunker German soldiers ( who sound awfully British ) have to take refuge in a bunker when Allied American forces have surrounded them . Only an old timer , a bit off his rocker , and a young soldier are present inside the bunker to protect it until they join them . With hardly any supplies and little ammunition , they are easy sitting-ducks ready to be picked apart . Within the gut of the bunker is a creepy , dark , dank tunnel which might lead to a way out if the Americans haven't found out about it . But , something sinister lives within the tunnels where a large crop of human skeletons and bones are stored . The tunnel seems to be a sort-of burial ground for dead soldiers put there by the German Reich . But , as wise tales of the tunnel's creepy past begin to fester in the minds of those in the bunker , paranoia , mistrust and irrational behavior set in with disastrous results . Ambitious film doesn't have the budget to quite succeed . It tries it's hand at making the soldiers human , but it's hard to care about their fates knowing who they are . You almost feel like cheering for whoever is causing these soldiers to turn inside out . The dark tunnel is a highlight providing some chills , but I felt it has lots of potential in it's "" ghostly "" story-line it fails to capitalize on . That could be because not enough money was present to provide us with ghastly looking ghouls , but it seems director Rob Green is aiming for what you don't see than showing us ghosts with decaying corpses or skeleton soldiers going for revenge . There is an interesting reason behind a certain violent deed these particular Nazi soldiers did that plagues on them which might provide the motivation of acts against them in the bunker . There's also a running theme about desertion as one soldier goes mad wishing to eliminate all those German soldiers who came to the bunker after departing war when it was getting harsh .

643,"Text1: One good Werewolf movie ! Minor SpoilersThis is one of My favorite Werewolf films . I remember in 1996 seeing a trailer of Bad Moon on TV one night before Halloween and it was the only trailer I saw too and it seemed like it came and left as soon as it arrived : ( I really like the story of the film and the cast . Mariel Hemingway looked good and played her part good Dennis the Menaces ' Mason Gamble was good too but Michael Par√© was great and especially when he turned into the werewolf . The beginning of it has a sex scene that I don't care for simply because I think sex scenes ruins a good movie but it is OK in this film because of what happens during it ! The werewolf suit and effects are top notch and is arguably the greatest looking werewolf in a movie ! There is some gore but its not the goriest . All werewolf fans check this one out as I don't think you'll be disappointed !


Text2: A very faithful adaptation of the book , but I wasn't overly impressed I left "" Narnia "" feeling kind of cold . I loved the books as a child , and most specifically "" The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , "" which I read numerous times when I was young . . . but no matter how faithful the adaptation is - story-wise - some elements don't fit into place . I think it's one of those books that is better off left as a book . The themes and actions that take place in C . S . Lewis ' Christian allegory do not translate well to the screen . I felt that something was off . The direction by Andrew Adamson ( "" Shrek "" ) is commendable , but the second half of the movie is very bright , the animation throughout is quite poor ( except for Aslan ) , and the final battle comes across as utterly silly . Also , by squeezing the book into a two-hour movie whilst still retaining the essence of the novel , Adamson's film lacks cohesion . It all happens too fast . The characters are rather thin and I felt as if some scenes were handled poorly . For example , when Edmund first meets the White Witch - - if you were a young child who had just stumbled into a world inside a wardrobe , then told by a queen you were going to be the king , don't you think it'd be hard to conceal your excitement ? Instead , Edmund returns into the real world , and the only hint we get that he's thinking about Narnia is when a very poor exposition scene occurs with Peter pointing out how Edmund is sulking about . The course of action in the film is poorly developed as well . One minute they're reluctant to fight , the next minute they're armored up . The problem is that with a two-hour film like this , it's hard to develop the characters . In a novel , it's easier - the general narratives of novels make us feel more attached to the characters . WATCHING them is much different - and it's hard to take their decision to join Narnia's battle against the White Witch very seriously at all . Also , maybe I was the only one who noticed that young Georgie Henley ( who plays Lucy ) was always smiling . Not just a happy smile , though . A wicked smile , like she's just played a trick on somebody and ready to savor the revenge . It's kind of creepy . When she cries at the end , it still looked like she was ready to stab someone in the back and break into a maniacal laugh . Am I being harsh ? Probably a bit too much , yes . It's just that coming from a child-at-heart who loved this particular book years ago , I feel the adaptation as a whole is simply mediocre . I felt disattached from the characters , I thought the animation was poor , some scenes were handled poorly , and the final battle was a joke . Overall , it's worth seeing if you like the book ( s ) . I was personally disappointed by the film , but it seems - judging from its IMDb rating - most people weren't . Hopefully the sequel will be better .

644,"Text1: A strong , absorbing and effectively creepy horror winner Classy , worried Claire Ward ( the lovely Jane Sibbett ) hires smooth private detective John March ( the likable John Terry ) to find out what her secretive , obsessive husband Charles Dexter Ward ( a typically fine , intense and gripping portrayal by the always reliable Chris Sarandon ) has been doing in a remote woodland farmhouse he's secluded himself in . The pair discover much to their horror and dismay that Ward has found the key to immortality , which naturally comes at a truly terrible price . Director Dan ( "" The Return of the Living Dead "" ) O'Bannon , working from an intricate and intelligent script by Brent V . Friedman ( said script is based on a H . P . Lovecraft short story ) , deftly creates and sustains an arrestingly eerie and mysterious mood , keeps the pace plugging along at a steady clip , and coaxes solid performances from a sturdy cast ( Robert Romanus in particular is very engaging as March's wiseguy partner Lonnie ) . Moreover , Irv Goodnoff's glossy , graceful cinematography , Richard ( "" Re-Animator "" ) Band's soaring , supremely spooky score , and Todd Masters ' wonderfully grotesque creature f / x are all up to par as well . The film reaches its marvelously clammy , creepy and claustrophobic nerve-wracking zenith when March , Claire and Lonnie venture into the farmhouse basement and encounter the ghastly mistakes of Ward's previous failed experiments . Best of all , the grimly serious tone , judicious use of gore and monster effects , and gradual build-up towards a startling climax ensure that this feature works remarkably well as one hell of a fiercely unsettling scarefest .

Text2: An incredibly strange and thus quite wonderful one-of-a-kind oddity An incredibly strange and mixed-up movie indeed ! This divinely demented Ray Dennis Steckler doozy actually inspired legendary late , great gonzo madman rock critic Lester Bangs to make a rare foray into wild-eyed film journalism in which he wrote a hilariously lengthy and thorough essay praising this picture to the high heavens for "" Cream "" magazine . That amazing trivia tidbit alone is a sterling testament to this wacky marvel's stupendously screwball greatness . Sinister old gypsy fortune teller Madame Estrella ( a nicely fat and juicy slice of eye-rolling villainous ham by the bewitching Brett O'Hara ) who works in a seedy seaside carnival turns unfortunate guys into zombies by disfiguring their faces with acid and locks the groaning'n'moaning wretched skull-faced worms up in a closet . Meanwhile , mellow , hip-talking unemployed proto-slacker protagonist Jerry ( Steckler in a spectacularly stolid performance ) falls under the nasty old gypsy hag's evil spell , who along with her scrumptious stripper sister Carmelita ( Steckler's ravishing real-life onetime hottie redhead wife Carolyn Brandt ) hypnotizes our likeably deadbeat hero into becoming a crazed , knife-brandishing murderous maniac . Okay , so the messy ramshackle narrative aimlessly ( and amiably ) meanders all over the place in a hopelessly haphazard manner , but it's this very undisguised all-out ineptitude which is part and parcel to this loopy winner's mesmerizingly askew off-center appeal . Sure , the clumsily choreographed bump'n'grind dance numbers set to raunchy scratchy saxophone music certainly don't hurt matters any ; the fact that said burlesque dance routines are pretty racy and really quite sexy for their time only makes things even better . The astonishingly varied acting is another plus , encompassing both dismal flatness and hysterical histrionics in comparable measure ( the sublimely incomprehensible Atlas King in particular is weirdly endearing as our hero's loyal best friend ) . Handsomely shot in beautifully ripe , resplendent , richly saturated color by ace cinematographer Joseph V . Mascelli , with able assistance from future big deal directors of photography Laszlo Kovacs and Vilmos Zsigmond , the film has an attractive slick look to it and sporadic exhilarating moments of boldly imaginative experimental visual razzle-dazzle which totally transcend the otherwise highly conspicuous spare change budget . A truly astounding kitsch landmark .

645,"Text1: "" Dear Mister Echo . . . "" ' The Young Ones ' polarised audiences when it first appeared in 1982 , if you were over thirty you regarded it , as Malcolm Allison did , ' utter rubbish ' , but if you were under thirty you loved it ! I have to admit I was not an immediate fan , but took to it after several viewings . ' The Young Ones ' was all about four students - hippie Neil , punk Vyvian , wide boy Mike , and hyperactive Rik , who never seemed to do any studying . They lived in a house where incredibly surreal things happened , such as the furniture talking to itself , or atom bombs dropping through the roof . The characters weren't likable , but then they weren't meant to be . Alexei Sayle cropped up from time to time as their landlord , Mr . Balowski . The humour was aggressive , violent , and very rude , more so than any show had been before . My favourite gag was when Vyvian leaned out of a moving train , only to be instantly decapitated . We then saw his headless body pull the communication cord , get out , and run up the track ! Some aspects have undeniably dated ; for instance , a ' Dallas ' spoof contained the credit : VITRIOL CONSULTANT - MISS NINA COW . This was a dig at the television critic Nina Myskow , who was one of ' Dallas ' most vocal supporters . The ' tampon ' gag in an early episode caused a sensation . Full credit for this show must not only go to the performers , but also to writers Rik Mayall , Lise Mayer ( whatever happened to her ? ) and Ben Elton ( who appeared occasionally ) . It is difficult to think of another comedy show that captured the spirit of the ' 80's so successfully .


Text2: Walking On The Moon The Moon is passing through a solar system with a sun very like our own . One planet in particular - Ariel - has Earth-like conditions , so Carter blasts off in his Eagle to investigate . Strange objects launched from Ariel land on the lunar surface . Gas emerges from each , giving the Moon a breathable atmosphere . With the sun in the sky , the Alphans find they are able to leave the sterile confines of Alpha and walk about outside . Further Ariellian devices bring about rain . An Eagle carrying Sandra , Carter , Paul , and Helena is affected by a storm and crashes . Though all aboard survive they face the prospect of dying of starvation before they can be discovered . . . Not long after Year 1 was completed , Fred Freiburger was invited to make an assessment of the series . While praising the special effects , he claimed the characters were uninteresting and there was a genuine lack of humour . Well , we all know what his remedy to the ' problem ' was - bring in a shape-changing alien woman and get a previously unmentioned Alphan to try and brew his own beer . One wonders which episodes he viewed . Was ' The Last Sunset ' among them ? Presumably not . If he had seen it , he would have realised it had more characterisation than in the whole of his dismal Year 2 . The Alphans , for once , are given an alternative to their quest to find a new planet - live on the Moon itself . Their joy at finding their new ' home ' is truly heart warming . Christopher Penfold's script gives Prentis Hancock's ' Paul Morrow ' a bit more to do by having him turn into a religious maniac as the result of consuming the strange mushroom-like fungus he finds on the lunar surface . The situation with the crashed Eagle is reminiscent of the classic ' Star Trek ' episode ' The Galileo Seven ' - only without those spear-throwing primitives . The absence of guest stars worked in the story's favour , allowing for greater interaction among the regular cast . Of course the Alphans ' hope of turning the Moon into a giant holiday camp is doomed . The Ariellians only gave them this because they wanted to keep them away from their world . The final scene - in which Koenig and co . watch the sun go down for the very last time - is touching and one of the best endings of any episode of this series .

646,"Text1: Aping a success . "" Traffic "" was a well done film , clear in its ambiguity , and ending with a small and ironic victory after a string of defeats . There were few heavies - - most people were in the grip of self interest . Less effort went into this production . I missed most of the first part but the texture of the flick is apparent from what I caught . The most surprising and effective part is the location shooting . For a Lifetime Movie , this is unexpectedly grimy . It ends with a shootout in Newark in the rain . Well , considering that it's Newark , I guess we can't say that the location is especially dirty . The rest of it is probably above average for a Lifetime Movie and below average for what it attempts to be - - the expose of a shocking trade in illegal goods , namely human beings . Southerland is fine . He's aging nicely . Mira Sorvino doesn't belong in this part . The structure is confusing in a way that "" Traffic "" is not . And the plot is more like a James Bond movie . It gives us a ring of human traffickers with a lot of organization and a single heavy sitting on top - - a kind of Doctor No or Blofeld - - who is killed off at the end . ( He takes 94 bullets - - I counted . ) Perhaps worst of all , it takes a problem which undoubtedly exists ( name a vice that doesn't ) and PREACHES at us for neglecting it ! The problem needs to be carefully studied and , as far as I'm aware , it never has been . Surely pretty young people wind up in some sort of sexual slave trade , but I would guess that they are mostly kidnapped from ( or sold by ) families on starvation diets in third-world countries . Few of them are likely to be beautiful Russian models or preadolescent girls from vacationing middle-class American families . And it's impossible to imagine why it would be necessary to trick and brutalize women from all around the world just to have them wind up in a whorehouse in Newark , where hookers are already a glut on the market . ( Offhand , I would expect to find a lot of Africans , Afghanis , Indians , and possibly Chinese girls among the kidnapped . ) But , to be sure , I don't know the dimensions of the problem . No one possibly can at this point . So the outcry of mass rage that the movie inspires is not yet justified and , even if it were , has no target yet . There's another feature film floating around on TV that follows the kidnapping selling of the president's daughter , no less , and winds up with her rescue at Dubai , UAE . That movie uses our new enemies as heavies - - the Arabs . This one uses a tried-and-true heavy - - the Russians , cashing in on sentiments left over from the Cold War . German heavies seem to be fading away , along with people who remember World War II . It's remarkable , the way political winds sway our fictional narratives . "" Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Iranian "" , anyone ?


Text2: The reason TFTC died While the first film was a solid , self-contained horror flick with a touch of humor and a fair amount of sophistication and imagination , Bordello of Blood falls apart under poor direction and a far too free-spirited nature . While it is a failure as a sequel it manages to entertain only as a brainless time waster . Dennis Miller does his best with the weak material and ad-libs a lot of humor . A little too much , taking the film even further from it's already vague ambitions . But worry not , his humor is still free and easy , unlike his cryptic ( no pun intended ) football commentaries . Erika Eleniak is marginally engaging and Corey Feldman is well underused . The weakest performances come from Angie Everhart as the ancient vampire Lillith and Chris Sarandon as the outrageously stereotyped southern TV evangelist . It's these performances that keep the film eternally low brow . It's sad that Tales from the Crypt totally died after this movie but the powers behind it went on to found the Dark Castle production company ( check out those movies they're actually quite scary and effective ) . The new version of Bordello of Blood is by Universal and is presented in it's proper aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic and is in Dolby 5 . 1 . The cheapo snapper case has been replaced by a sturdy keepcase and a new cover art . The only new extra is a trailer .

This is simply one fine and effective little comedy that is nothing too brilliant or hilarious but is simply a movie that constantly entertains and will surely make you laugh more than once . The movie is mostly being made enjoyable by its characters . It has some greatly fun characters in it , who of course are over-the-top and perhaps also not the most original once . Nevertheless it works out fine which is also due to the fine acting performance , which I have to say , were better than expected . I didn't really knew Ryan Reynolds as a comedy actor but he is simply great at it . He plays the main character of the movie , which means that he also mostly gets to carry the movie . He really manages well and plays a good convincing fat guy as well as a good convincing slick music manager / womanizer . Mind you , it's not a double role but it's the same character actually . The movie doesn't really feature the best known comedy actors of this moment but the casting is simply good , with Amy Smart , Anna Faris and Chris Klein all in some good comedy roles . Of course the story is mostly predictable though and the movie is set around Christmas , which makes this a Christmas movie and got released in late October originally . But seriously , "" Just Friends "" is not necessarily a Christmas movie and basically can be watched at any time of the year . Luckily it doesn't lay its emphasis on Christmas and the jolly Christmas spirit , like some other comedies released around Christmas would do . Despite having some over-the-top character , I don't really feel that the movie itself as a whole doesn't ever go over-the-top with its situations . It does has some Will Ferrell of Ben Stiller kind of moments in it so to speak but its style and directing always makes sure that the movie remains a sort of a humble and restrained one with its comedy and I mean this in a positive way . Forced comedy just doesn't always work out that well and "" Just Friends "" surely doesn't take this risk , which however also has as a consciences though that the movie isn't the best or most memorable one within its genre but the movie serves its purpose and it does not fail to entertain you throughout . Simply a fine genre movie to watch .

It might not be as good as the German and American work from the same period but overall it's a solid , original and interesting enough movie . The concept and overall story of the movie are great - and original thriller material . The movie is however really short and therefor some elements in the story felt rushed . It didn't took enough time to build its tension and mystery . The main character of the movie , played by Henry Kendall , is at times hilarious , at other times he's borderline annoying and at times he's just plain irritating as an over-the-top English-gentleman . So no , not a great consistency of the main character . It doesn't always help to make the movie and its story enjoyable and interesting to watch . The movie screams for a remake really . The concept and story of the movie are good , mysterious and tense enough to make a real solid thriller , by todays standards , with . The movie its story really deserves a modern update . As a whole is a quite solid early British take on the thriller-genre , which is still enjoyable and interesting enough to watch by todays standards , mainly thanks to the really original concept of the movie that is executed well enough but not to the max . I can however still really recommend this movie to the fans of early cinema and to those this movie is perhaps even a bit of an must-see , also a bit due to the very solid and at times quite revolutionary original editing , from none other than David Lean !

The hippies are nice , but also really dumb and completely out of it ! In the end , the guy demands they let him out , as he can't take any more of their pointless optimism and creepy ways ! This short film is really way too short - - especially on plot . However , despite having just the tiniest thread of a story , it still was worth a look because it was fun watching the guy getting a lift getting angry ! No matter what he said , the hippies were so dippy and hyper-happy that he kept getting more and more frustrated at them . No particular point - - just a short-tempered guy getting really annoyed at these very annoying folks ! It made me laugh , but overall it didn't seem like a real film - - just a funny moment clipped from a film or TV show . Still , it did make me laugh and sometimes that's just enough .


Text2: In desperate need of restoration . We should start a charity fund . It has grown mythic in my mind since several Europeans that I talkto on the internet began to tell me many months ago that Chimesat Midnight was an Orson Welles film that they preferred even toCitizen Kane . Yet it was unavailable in the US , and I thought that Iwould never see it . But finally I found a copy at a local alternativevideo store . I must say , to suggest that it beats Kane is giving it more creditthan it deserves . That film is today generally considered the verybest ever made ( on my own list , the latest version , it lands at # 12 ) , though that status was hard fought over those who overrate thecastrated version of The Magnificent Ambersons , though that filmis indeed , too , a masterpiece in its own right . But Chimes atMidnight is itself also a small masterpiece . Considering howcheaply it seems to have been made , the results are jaw - dropping . It is among Welles best , though saying that is asredundant as saying a play is ranked highly in Shakespeare'scanon . I have to confess to not knowing much about which Shakespeareplays Welles was using ; I don't have the necessary research toolsas I write this . I believe that he used a mixture of several plays , butnothing in the film seemed familiar to me , who have read only aquarter of them . Whatever Welles did , though , the results areamazing . His direction and editing give the film an enormouskinetic energy . The famous battle scene , the centerpiece of thefilm , ranks among the best ever created on film ( I would saycaptured , but Welles , presumably on account of the low cost ofproduction , creates the tension and fury of it by editing mostly , notcinematography or complex direction ) . Welles the actor is at thepeak of his form , though that is redundant , too . Did Welles evergive a bad performance ? I haven't seen too many outside of hisown directorial efforts , but the few I have seen I must concedewere beyond excellent . One other mention of acting : what the hellhappened to Jeanne Moreau ? Was Orson Welles stealing hermeals ? For Christ's sake , she looks like she's dying . I've seen six of the , what , ten or eleven films that Welles directed . Five of those I've given a , including Falstaff . Only Macbeth , which I felt paid too much attention to the technical aspects andnot enough to the actual play ( although it was only the secondWelles film I saw and that was a while back ) , I have given lessthan that , a . Falstaff I rank fifth out of the remaining five ( inorder : Citizen Kane , Touch of Evil , The Trial , The MagnificentAmbersons ) . Perhaps I would rank it as highly as my Europeanfriends do , but there is one issue that may be destroying itsbrilliance : the tape that I rented was in the most awful condition . Generally , my credo is that I won't watch a direct cinematicadaptation of a Shakespeare play unless I have read the original , but lately I have noticed that I can understand his dialogue quitesufficiently . However , as Shakespeare is difficult to comprehend byear alone , imagine hearing Shakespearean dialogue spoken byCharlie Brown's teacher ! As the print I saw was terrible , voices aresometimes impossible to understand . I think I only caught around of the dialogue , which made the plot somewhat difficult tofollow . The picture's contrast was quite bad , too , but notunbearable . The sound was definitely the biggest wound the filmhas received . But as films are being restored every day , andWelles's importance has never been denied , we must pray thatthis one is on someone's agenda . I pray for a Criterion edition witha great commentary track on the side that can decipher everythingI'll miss .

"" "" Any Gun Can Play "" probably has more ' vamanos ' and ' andeles ' than any spaghetti Western out there , while mixing in it's share of black hats , stogies , beards and ponchos . The opening scene is a blast , it will make you sit up and take notice of some familiar , yet unfamiliar characters who aren't around long enough to worry about . The film keeps you guessing as to the relationship of it's three principals , as alliances are made and broken with tenuous regularity , with bandit Monetero's lady even switching sides when it suits her . I got a kick out of the way the self proclaimed ' Stranger ' ( George Hilton ) kept raising the ante on the reward for Montenero's ( Gilbert Roland ) capture , and wondered if the authorities were on the same page . Even though Edd Byrnes ' ' kookie ' persona kept intruding , he still managed to maintain a sufficiently duplicitous posture as banker Clayton . The slick move he pulled with the spilled drink to catch a reflection struck me as surprisingly clever . The best though was taking up the pugilistic stance to mix it up with the Stranger , that was hilarious ! The movie has some outstanding cinematography purporting to be the border of Mexico and it provides a great scenic backdrop to the action . The ' tres cientos mil ' dollars at the core of the story is never seen until the end of the picture when it showers the principals and even then , I had the impression that if the three hombres had it to do all over again , it might have gone an entirely different way .

Text2: Ambitious Italian thriller with obvious Giallo echoes The era of illustriousness for the Italian Gialli movies is long over and gone ? more than twenty years already , in fact ? but ambitious Italian filmmakers occasionally still breeze in to deliver new movies with plenty of echoes to this wondrous sub genre of European horror / thriller cinema . Some fine recent examples of this include "" The Unknown Woman "" , "" Eyes of Crystal "" and "" The Girl by the Lake "" . Luigi Cecinelli's "" Visions "" arguably also ranks high amongst these chosen few , although the parallelism between this film and the authentic Gialli of the early 70's is much more subtle and indistinct . Giallo-obsessed freaks , like myself , will undoubtedly spot the likenesses , but to the majority of normal film-loving audiences "" Visions "" will probably just comes across as a convoluted but solid , suspenseful and very engaging psychological thriller . Andrea Del Monte's script is perhaps slightly over-ambitious and pseudo-intellectual for its own good , resulting into a confusing and improbable finale , but some of the basic plot-ingredients and ideas are deeply impressive . And even though director Cecinelli and writer Del Monte are relatively inexperienced , "" Visions "" is also a skilfully stylish , coherently structured and adequately shot accomplishment . The opening ten minutes are unquestionably the best and most memorable ones , as they cover the latest onslaught of the smart and seemingly unstoppable serial killer known as "" The Spider "" . In an attempt to rescue several of his captured victims at once , the entire police squad as well as the hostages die an excruciatingly painful death . The traumatized FBI-profiler Dr . Leeman resigns and returns to his previous job ; psychiatrist in a private clinic . A certain time later one of his patients , Matt ? an amnesia patient recovering from a car accident ? accidentally stumbles upon Dr . Leeman's notes and records on The Spider's case and begins to suffer from nightmarish visions that are accurately illustrating the infamous serial killer's deeds . Suspecting some kind of psychic or perhaps even physical link with The Spider , Matt digs deeper into the case , in assistance with a fellow patient , a sexy journalist and eventually even Dr . Leeman himself . "" Visions "" may seem predictable and fairly obvious straight from the beginning , but there's a lot more than superficially meeting the eye . It's a puzzle gradually getting more difficult to solve with each piece that falls into place and you only comprehend the complete picture when the entire puzzle is solved . Your initial guess regarding the denouement might be correct , but nonetheless there are several twist and turns throughout the film that are simply too complex to predict . I realize this all sounds extremely vague and maybe even bit misleading , but it honestly would be a shame to reveal anything more and risk spoiling a potentially surprising viewing experience . Try and think of "" Visions "" like some sort of odd but unexpectedly effective crossbreed of "" Saw "" and "" The Usual Suspects "" . The special effects are top-class and overwhelming , even a tad bit exaggerated sometimes , and there are a handful of moments of grisly violence . Hopefully this clever and zealous Italian production receives a proper distribution , as it deserves a wide audience .

652,"Text1: A Wonderful Case of Revenge LONG-HAIRED HARE is one of a number of Warners Cartoon that made in the late 1940s and into the 1950s that spoofed high culture - the best being WHAT'S OPERA DOC ? But this one is also like several other Warner cartoons when Bugs confronted authoritarian types ( a floor walker in a department store , a magician named Ala Bama ) , and trounced them in confrontations . Here his opponent is a temperamental opera singer named Giovanni Jones . We see Bugs in the hills above Hollywood strumming a banjo singing a jaunty tune ( "" What do they do on a rainy day in Rio ? "" ) and below in a mansion is Jones practicing Figaro's famous introductory aria from THE BARBER OF SEVILLE ( which he will be performing that night ) . But every time he is rehearsing he is hearing Bugs singing that jaunty song . He retaliates by destroying the banjo . Then he goes back to rehearsing , but Bugs has started playing the tune on a harp . Jones begins singing and dancing to the words of Bugs ' tune , when he realizes what has happened . He proceeds to destroy the harp . Then he hears Bugs on a tuba , and pulls Bugs up through the tuba and ties him to a tree branch by his ears , pulling him down so that Bugs ' head hits the branch several times ( like a rubber band being snapped ) . Bugs says that this means war - and carries it to the Hollywood Bowl . He tests the fabled acoustics of the bowl by hitting the dome with a mallet causing the dome and stage to vibrate like an earthquake is occurring . He causes Giovanni to swallow alum , so that his voice and head shrink . He has the pompous singer sign a teeny-bopper's autograph , with a stick of dynamite as a pen . And finally he takes over the orchestra as "" Leopold "" ( his hair is whitened as Stowkowski's is ) to conduct the conclusion . Now I saw the entire ten minute cartoon on YOU TUBE . In the past I have seen a truncated version on television that cut out most of the damage Bugs does to Giovanni prior to the arrival of "" Leopold "" . I did not realize that much more was done in the course of the cartoon than the shattering conclusion . There is a lot that television editing owes the television audience an apology for - certainly for weakening the full effect of an entertaining piece of work like this is one thing that a real apology is needed for . By shortening it , it made less sense to the viewer - as Bugs just seems to be there for that one long final act of his . We know Bugs . When he gets even - he gets even !


Text2: Errol Flynn's attempt at film noir I think it is generally acknowledged that Errol Flynn's best film work was in those films that combined his charm and his athletic abilities , be they swashbucklers , boxing films , or westerns . But as he got older Flynn was determined to prove his acting abilities . He could act when he was generally interested in the film he appeared in , but he was frequently willing to try to do a film that was unusual . This did not always work too well . He made such interesting failures as THE SISTERS with Bette Davis , where he was a newspaper reporter in turn of the century San Francisco , who had a wanderjahr that interfered with his marriage . The film wasn't bad , but his part was weak - the antithesis of the type he usually played so well . In the late 1940s to 1950 he tried three films to broaden his scope of acting : CRY WOLF , THAT FORSYTE WOMAN , and SILVER RIVER . Only the last one , a western where he played a man who was carried away by ambitious and greed so that he becomes relatively unsympathetic , was successful . THAT FORSYTE WOMAN ( with Greer Garson and Walter Pigeon ) was interesting ( Flynn as Soames Forsythe was interesting casting , but he was too stiff - Eric Porter's memorable Soames in the first BBC version of the Galsworthy stories in the 1960s was far more human ) . CRY WOLF , the present film , was Flynn's only real attempt at the noir style of movie . As such it begins well , but collapses due to a poor script . Barbara Stanwyck has married Richard Basehart , the nephew of Flynn , before the movie began . Flynn , Basehart , Jerome Cowan , and Geraldine Brooks are the scions of a "" Kennedy "" style family , with money and political power ( Cowan is a U . S . Senator ) . But Basehart has vanished , and Stanwyck , besides trying to prove her marriage , is determined to find her husband . And here she keeps running into Flynn's suspicious behavior . He seems very unsympathetic to her wishes , and quite cold most of the time . As for helping her locate Basehart , he keeps on throwing up roadblocks . The problem is that having set a good stage for a film which would have been confronting Stanwyck's heroine with Flynn's villain , the script fell apart . It turns out Flynn is interested in protecting the family's name and it's members from outside scrutiny . In particular Basehart and Brooks , who are somewhat strange . This change in the script was meant to enable Stanwick and Flynn to gradually fall in love and end up together , but it smashed the suspense that such a film should generate , and it ruined Flynn from having a potentially interesting negative part . Actually his performance in SILVER RIVER was far more consistent , and even his Soames retains the audience's lack of sympathy to the end . In CRY WOLF the audience gets confused - should we hiss Flynn or cheer him on ? It would have been better all around if the screenplay writers had let us hiss him to the end .

653,"Text1: You're better off re-watching the giant squid attack in "" 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea "" . "" Tentacles "" is a very silly and cheesy monster movie about an enormous octopus that claims an assortment of dumb victims for approximately 100 minutes of screen time . Marine expert Bill Gleeson ( Bo Hopkins ) and his associate Mike ( Alan Boyd ) take it upon themselves to try to destroy the monster after it has wreaked havoc upon a sailing regatta . Yet another film in the long line of 1970's era "" Jaws "" wannabes , made by Italian film-maker Ovidio Assonitis . The oddest aspect of this amusing example of bad B-cinema is seeing a troupe of performers who many viewers might feel are WAY too good for the likes of this stuff . John Huston , Henry Fonda , Claude Akins , Cesare Danova , Shelley Winters , and Hopkins are the familiar faces . I found that some of the music , particularly the "" jump "" music cues , to be overwhelmingly dumb . The movie itself , while not entirely lacking in the suspense department , is also much too plodding . The sequence where the rampaging beast attacks the sailors is done in a fashion too strange to work , with a number of freeze frames and a score that distracts from rather than adding to the effectiveness of the scene . While this movie does admittedly qualify as "" junk "" , I find myself sort of enjoying it anyway ; it does have a certain dumb , guilty pleasure sort of charm to it . Some of the actors look a little too weary and embarrassed , but Hopkins is likable and enjoyable as the Matt Hooper-style ocean expert with a special bond with his killer whale friends . The widescreen Technovision photography is decent , and the underwater scenes appropriately murky and gloomy ( with that one odd , disconcerting shot where scores of dead fish are standing on end ) . Again , this is the kind of film where I would tell potential viewers to go in with no real expectations . It's just simple , silly , low-budget genre fare , good for a few chuckles and chills , but no more than that .


Text2: "" Gray ? Our mangler's a zombie ! "" Well , not really . The killer in this low budget genre effort was supposed to be a zombie originally , but ultimately was turned into an alien instead . After an opening crawl / narration that really doesn't make sense when you think about it , our movie begins , as a creature ( which , curiously , seems to be dressed in human clothes ) begins mercilessly slaughtering people on a nightly basis . Former jailbird and successful author Roy Warner ( William Devane , in an atypical role ( and look ) for him ) teams up with ambitious TV journalist Zoe Owens ( Cathy Lee Crosby ) to track down the alien . "" The Dark "" is not without flaws ; my biggest problem was that the pacing is a little slow , which doesn't help since the movie isn't as interesting when the creature's not killing anybody and we're obliged to watch as the human characters hunt it down . However , it's undeniably a moody little tale ; the film-makers really do make this a genuinely dark film and go the now familiar route of taking their time to reveal the creature . One interesting gimmick is to always have a blind man character sort of announce the presence of the creature . Maybe it ultimately gets a little cheesy when we see the creature's m . o . - it shoots lasers from its eyes - but it's never unbearably cheesy . The climax , where the creature fights it out with the cops , is undeniably the best part , for then things get a little lively . The music score is enjoyable in a campy sort of way - it features overbearing "" whispering "" ( "" The . . . DARK . . . ness ! ! ! "" ) before "" Friday the 13 "" made the "" ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma "" sound effect an integral part of the scoring of that series . The acting in the supporting roles is typically more amusing than that of the leads : Richard Jaeckel as a surly detective , Keenan Wynn as Crosby's swaggering boss , Biff Elliot as Jaeckel's comic-relief partner , Jacquelyn Hyde as the psychic who predicts one of the creature's victims , Casey Kasem ( that's right ) as the police pathologist . Look for Kathy Richards ( now better known as Kathy Hilton , mother of Paris ) as the first victim , and Philip Michael Thomas of ' Miami Vice ' fame as a gang leader . It's not altogether satisfying but I have to say that I did enjoy it to some degree . It's silly but generally agreeable low-budget genre fare . One might simply have to be , like me , partial to this sort of film to begin with .

E . : Scream to the Skies starts as Transglobal passenger flight 442 carrying 147 crew & passengers from Los Angeles to Chicago is struck by lightening & is forced to land in the Ocean just off the coast . Word quickly reaches the emergency services & a full scale rescue is mounted , the Los Angeles county coroner's office has the unpleasant task of performing the autopsies & identifying the dead including Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) who is devastated by what he sees . Upset by all the needless death & fully aware that most if not all of the passengers exited the crashed plane safely only to die of hypothermia in the freezing Ocean waters Quincy sets out on a campaign to make sure all commercial flights over water are equipped with life rafts . . . Episode 11 from season 6 this Quincy story was directed by Ron Satlof & is an odd episode for a few reasons . For a start I should say that Scream to the Skies is an entirely moralistic episode that was produced solely for the reason of highlighting inadequacies in airline safety & in particular the absence of life rafts on planes although sitting here writing this in 2008 some twenty seven years after Scream to the Skies was made I am not sure if that message is still relevant or whether planes are now obliged to carry life rafts . The one unusual aspect of Scream to the Skies as a Quincy episode is that Quincy spends the first half of the episode really depressed , not talking to anyone & refusing to go back to work which is totally unheard of for the character . But then about halfway through he miraculously snaps out of it & tries to get the Government to force the FAA to make life rafts compulsory before a strangely downbeat ending in which the airline takes out a court order against Quincy saying anything that might hurt their business . I must admit that I like the murder mystery episodes of Quincy & Scream to the Skies has no murder , no mystery , Quincy doesn't get to use his medical skills & knowledge to solve a crime & the first half of the episode is quite annoying watching Quincy sit around feeling sorry for himself . Scream to the Skies features some Plan 9 from Outer Space ( 1959 ) style special effects , the model plane that crashes at the start looks terrible & you can see it held up by wires . Also while watching the start I was wondering where all the other emergency services were , why would Qyuincy a medical examiner be the first one on the scene & as far as I could see the only doctor there ? Wouldn't there have been helicopters & dozens of boats ? According to the IMDb certain scenes in this were shot at Bob Hope Airport . The one thing that makes Scream to the Skies watchable is another compelling performance from Klugman who is again superb in the role , from sadness & sorrow to anger & determination he gives a terrific performance here . Scream to the Skies is not the sort of Quincy episode that I enjoy & I will say right now that I didn't like it at all but for another top performance from Klugman .

I remember first seeing this movie in the mid-'90's , just before the time it was released as a rental movie . My brother was working in a video-store and had to take a few new video's home with him in order to decide whether or not the video-store should buy this movie for rental purposes . In those days this movie was really something fun and spectacular to watch and shortly afterward Jackie Chan also became a real big and popular movie-star . Way more popular and appreciated as he is now days . What really makes this movie is its action . It's never anything too big , also since the movie is made obviously with a fairly low budget but it's very entertaining and amazing at the same time . Amazing , since obviously no harnesses or cables were used for the fight sequences and stunts . It also resulted in lots of broken bones and other injuries during the production but the end result for the movie is really something great and spectacular looking and is brought very entertainingly by Jackie Chan and director Stanley Tong , who both directed the action sequences together . You should see this movie just purely for its entertaining action , since everything else about the movie is actually quite bad to be honest . It might very well be the Jackie Chan movie with the very best action in it . The movie is a very entertaining one to watch that gets better as it progresses . It's as if the in the first halve tried to be too serious with its approach but in the second halve the gloves are off and the movie becomes truly ridiculously over-the-top and fun at the same time . The best example of this is perhaps the finale sequence in which Chan and his happy friends get the main bad guy with an hovercraft . It's a totally pointless and completely ridicules and also short , rushed done sequence but because of that it at the same time works out very hilarious . I'm still looking for a movie with a better use of the hovercraft than this one ! It's hard to really judge the acting in the movie , since all of the actors were dubbed , even the American actors . This gives the movie an even more ridicules feeling and also makes the acting seem as something completely horrible and over-the-top . The movie its story often makes lots of crazy jumps and it perhaps even feel as two totally different scripts that were blend in with each other , with as a result that not everything always makes a whole lot of sense and continuity and character treatments are messy . It perhaps almost seems as if the story was mainly purely there to let the movie feature as many and crazy stunts and fight sequences as possible . The movie is most of the time looking and definitely feeling as a B-movie but in a good way . It's made as an entertaining movie and at entertaining this movie does simply not fail . As long as you don't pay any attention to the story or logical and it's acting or anything else like it , you'll simply enjoy this movie for the entertainment that it brings , with mainly it's over-the-top but absolutely amazing action sequences .


Text2: Now this is one fine delightful screwball comedy ! I am not the biggest screwball comedy fan , since most movies just don't seem to really quite got ' it ' and are more or less often too much more of the same and they get drowned by the movie its clever story and low key sentiments . "" My Favorite Wife "" was however a screwball movie that I really enjoyed watching . It features all of the typical screwball elements , in which an odd unusual situations and how the characters handle them plays the central key element of the movie . Things get worse and worse when they get deeper and deeper into trouble when more facts slowly surface . It's a well written story that offers plenty of surprises with its moments and main plot-line , even though of course the movie in a sense is mostly predictable , just like any other genre movie . Who knows , perhaps the movie would had been even better if indeed Leo McCarey ended up directing it , like originally was intended . He however got involved in an automobile accident shortly before the filming of this movie and he had to pass on the directing honers to less experienced Garson Kanin . Kanin obviously didn't do a bad job with it but McCarey was of course more experienced in the genre and was definitely most at ease and in his element with directing these type of movies . He has some great classics below his belt , also prior to the release of this movie . McCarey still served as the writer and producer of the movie though , so his touch is still notable within the movie . The more I see of Cary Grant as a comedy actor , the more I start to like and appreciate him as one . He is of course still best known for the roles he played in Alfred Hitchcock movies but he successfully started off his career with movies such as this one . He was a great comedy actor who could play a regular guy , despite his always good look . While watching this movie it by the way also made me think ; ' Wow , this guy would had made a great James Bond ! ' . Later I found out that he was actually asked to play the James Bond character in the first 1962 Bond movie "" Dr . No "" but he turned it down because he believed to be too old already at the time to play the character . He stars in this movie with Irene Dunn , with who he has appeared in in several movies together throughout their career , which also all happen to be the same type of movies . Both were just 2 of the best and most successful genre actors at the time . One of the better movies that the ' 30's screwball genre has to offer .

660,"Text1: The Fly Returning to THE FLY for the first time in a while , I'm fascinated with the film's structure in story-telling . How the film introduces us to a distraught wife of a man killed under a press , his head and hand crushed . We are , at the off-set , told the tragic end of a scientist , yet I found myself completely gripped in the film anyway . Quite an achievement , I think . The science of the story might not hold up to scrutiny , and the costumed fly head and arm may seem less realistic by way of modern cinematic means , but there's still this rather shocking , unnerving quality THE FLY has that I totally bought into . Inspector Charas ( Herbert Marshall ) is investigating the case of why Helene Delambre ( Patricia Owens ) would purposely cause a press to smash her husband's body . At first unwilling to talk , Helene is finally coerced into telling the true story by her brother-in-law , Fran√ßois ( Vincent Price ) , as to why she committed such an act of violence . Her brilliant scientist husband , Andre ( David Hedison ) had developed a transport device which could teleport an object from one place to another by disintegrating the atoms , with them reintegrating back together . . such a method of travel would be of such importance and benefit mankind in so many different ways . But , in using the machine to transport himself from one machine to another , a common fly enters the chamber with him , causing horrifying results . I was amazed at how invested I was in the film , obviously knowing that only tragedy would result as Helene and her son , Philippe ( Charles Herbert ) try desperately to find the fly which had Andre's human head and arm . And , I could see why Fran√ßois and Inspector Charas would find the story so hard to fathom . While perhaps unconvincing unlike in it's heyday , the reveal of the fly head still packs a wallop ( . . that is if you are gripped by the story and care about the plight of the loving couple , the complications that result from tampering with the laws of nature ) , and further more the POV shot through the eye sight of Andre as Helene screams in horror is as effective as ever . Top notch cast with Price receiving lesser billing ( . . he still displays a range of emotions thanks to such a unsettling series of events , his character admitting his being in love with Helene ) , but still benefactor of being a part of yet another classic sci-fi horror film . Price's role here is for Helene's moral support during such a traumatic moment , having to bear the burden of Andre's loss , a decent and good man who fell victim to experimenting with the unexplored . . engaging in a science dealing with the very atoms that make everything what they are is obviously a dangerous path to take if something were to go wrong . And , THE FLY shows the aftermath of man's desire to explore the seemingly impossible . The scene where the fly is caught in the web of a spider drawing in to eat it really remains rather unsettling , but rescues poor Helene about to be sent off to the loony bin . HELP ME ! HELP ME !


Text2: What's all the fuss ? It's just OK Batman redone . It gives us a new origin of Batman ( Christian Bale ) and how he got his powers and such . He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman . His first two villains are the Scarecrow ( Cillain Murphy ) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul - - who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses . OK - - it's MUCH better then Tim Burton's dreadful movies but I still wasn't too impressed . I didn't like the new origin at all and it's a full hour before Batman even shows up ! It does have good parts - - Bale is dead on perfect as Bruce Wayne AND Batman . He also pumped up for the role ( we have at least two shirtless scenes ) . It LOOKS great ( if very dark ) and it has elaborate special effects left and right ( with tons of explosions thrown in too ) . But I was mostly bored . The training sequence at the beginning just went on endlessly - - it was more like The Shadow's origin than Batmans . Also this movie was WAY too heavy on darkness and atmosphere . At one point it was raining and I noticed nobody in Gotham pulled in their clothes from their lines . This isn't nit picking but obviously it was all out there to add an "" atmosphere "" to the scene . Also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that the movie just isn't doing its job ( i . e . entertaining you ) . However Batman's costume , the Batcave and the Batmobile are all explained pretty logically . Acting varies - - Bale was just great . Michael Caine ( as Alfred ) matched him . Even Katie Holmes ( a limited actress ) was good - - too bad she won't be in the sequel ( this inexplicable romance / marriage with Tom Cruise is destroying her career ) . Laim Neeson was very dull as a teacher - - he appeared to be drugged out . Gary Olman was ( suprisingly ) terrible as Jim Gordon - - he seems VERY unsure of how to play the role . But Rutger Hauer , Linus Roache ( who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bale ) and Morgan Freeman were all great . To be totally honest I looked at my watch more than once . I couldn't wait for this thing to get over . All the praise this is getting is beyond me . I give it a 7 - - and that's mostly for the acting .

"" The first hint of Daniel Plainview's unheralded villainy comes when he snubs Preacher Eli Sunday's request to perform a blessing upon the strike of the local oil well . You already have a sense of it as Plainview plies the unsophisticated rubes with a pittance compared to the value of their underground wealth . Those scenes conjure up ideas of what it must have really been like during the heady days of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century robber barons . Greed and power , pure and simple , taken well beyond the measure of Humphrey Bogart's character in "" The Treasure of the Sierra Madre "" which director Anderson watched faithfully prior to his filming of this modern masterpiece . If you need only one reason to watch this film , it would be Daniel Day Lewis ' excruciatingly sinister performance as the oil baron Plainview , setting a new low in human depravity with his ' You're just a bastard from a basket ' speech to adopted son H .

Text2: Adds more to the story than you expect . In the movie , when Dianne runs out of the Winchester she is calling her boyfriend's name . Because we just saw him torn to pieces by the zombies ( and because Dianne is beating zombies with his severed leg ) it's reasonable to assume that she can't save him and is instead making an insane rush against his killers , soon to meet her own similarly gruesome fate . Instead of simply illustrating Dianne's grisly fate , this one completely changes what we would otherwise expect , going in a totally different direction that amazingly makes perfect sense ( or as much sense as can be made in your typical zombie movie ) , while at the same time maintaining the same tongue-in-cheek tone of the rest of the movie . It's narrated by Dianne , of course , and has a characteristically classic joke at the end .

Well , because there were some unsavory family ties that he didn't want his daughter involved in . And how unsavory were these ties ? Well , grandpa gets it at the very beginning of the film , when he decides enough is enough , apparently , although a little late , I'd say .

Text2: A very interesting Dassin film . I saw that there was a couple of Nazi films on TNT last night and decided to give them a viewing . Sometimes these old black and whites can really have interesting stories . This was true to my expectations . This was a Jules Dassin film . He was one of the most important directors in post-WWII America . Unfortunately he got caught up in the Red Scare led by Senator McCarthy and was blacklisted . he moved to Europe , where he continued to make movies . His most influential film was the heist movie Rififi , which inspired a genre of movies including Ocean's Eleven and Mission : Impossible . The movie stars Conrad Veidt , who is himself a very interesting character . Most movie goers would remember him as Gestapo Maj . Strasser in the classic Casablanca . This is interesting because he was a staunch anti-Nazi who was himself chased out of Germany under threat of assassination . He was to play Dracula in 1931 , but Bela Lugosi got the job . His performance in The Man Who Laughs , was used as the basis for "" The Joker "" in the early Batman . Veidt give a good performance as a twin whose brother is a Nazi agent . he kills him and takes his place to fight against the Nazi underground in America . It is not a terribly exciting film , but it was suspenseful , and a chance to see one of the great American directors and a great German / British actor .

Between this , The Ring and a forthcoming remake of the rather weak Dark Water it seems as if Hollywood has tapped into a new well of unimagination . Which is weird , considering how pointless this remake is . Its only purpose is to serve those who cannot be bothered reading subtitles as the same director and some of the original cast remain as well as the fact that it's set in Japan . If they were bothering to remake it then why change 2 things ? The presence of English dialogue and mostly new actors seems a vague reason to redo this film . As PG-13 rated horrors go , this one is still scraping the bottom of the barrel . Seriously , The Grudge is the dredge of horror . I've not seen the original , despite being ' asked kindly ' to do so . But I could still see every scare coming . You just know because of the camera angles suddenly changing to an off-centre shot to accommodate something new . Either that or a scene of silence is built up so much that a sudden jolt is the only logical end . Unlike The Ring , there is no mystery to this film . It's all very straight-forward and , in the end , just boils down to typical slasher fare . Or scare-em-to-death fare as no one is physically killed in this film . Other than the Yoko character . Her fate made no sense and did not fit in with the internal ' logic ' of the script . And can someone explain Bill Pullman's actions at the beginning for me ? A very poor film indeed . Very repetitive , very slow and utterly pointless . As a horror film , The Grudge has as much integrity as Darkness Falls . This film is basically a cure . . . for NOT being asleep .

I also liked John Barry's score , despite the fact he claims it's his weakest effort on the series . TMWTGG was the last Bond film to be shot in a 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio and I do feel that if it was shot in Panavision then it would have more slick and polished look . 33 years on , TMWTGG looks too grainy and dated and appears older than it is .

The setting is beautiful - - the Dakota is a huge building in NY with very exclusive tenants . . . but it looks downright terrifying here ( I have to credit director Roman Polanski for that ) . Inside the apartments are huge but spooky . When Rosemary and Guy hear chanting through the walls on their first night or so there it's actually pretty chilling .

Farrow is really off sometimes and Cassavetes looks miserable ( I believe he later said he did it for the money ) but Gordon ( in her Oscar-winning role ) and Blackmer are just great .

Text2: The Penguin Should Have Had A Bigger Role This was an extremely silly ( downright stupid in spots ) farce of a comedy-adventure that gets by because it's so fast-moving and generally entertaining despite the cornball material . Even by Bob Hope standards - and his films were not the highlight of his incredible career - this film is not that funny . A major part of the problem is simply that the humor is too dated . This kind of slapstick isn't the clever stuff some of older silent comics performed , which is still great material . This is just plain dumb . The adventure part deals with Hope and British spy "" Karen Bentley "" ( Madeline Carroll ) and her attempts to stay one step ahead of the Nazis and the police as she transports valuable microfilm . Hope is along to help her and provide laughter . Hope's pet penguin was a lot funnier than Bob in this film . Dressed up in different outfits , the little creature was hilarious to view and made this film tolerable enough to sit through some 60 years later . In fact , this would have been a keeper if they had made the penguin the star , instead of the two dopey lead actors !

667,"Text1: Felix salutes Edgar Allan Poe and the Ritz Brothers . ' Bimbo's Initiation ' ( 1931 ) is generally considered one of the very best cartoons from the Fleischer studio . Here we have ' Skulls and Sculls ' , a Felix the Cat cartoon made a year earlier at a different studio , yet using exactly the same premise . Felix the Cat is walking along when he is abruptly blindfolded and subjected to an elaborate ordeal which turns out to be ( as the title hints ) a fraternal initiation . The whole premise of this cartoon makes it a period piece . The peak years of fraternal organisations in the United States coincided exactly with the years of Prohibition . That's no fluke . During Prohibition , an American couldn't ( legally ) walk into a bar and sup some booze , but fraternal organisations were permitted to serve alcohol to their members at no charge . . . so , naturally , a lot of thirsty men joined one secret order or another . Contrary to popular belief , it was not illegal to drink alcohol during Prohibition : what was illegal was the manufacture , transport and sale of spirits , not their consumption . In ' Skulls and Sculls ' , as in the later ' Bimbo's Initiation ' , most of Felix's ordeal is somewhat spooky . I was very impressed by one sequence in which Felix is menaced by a dangling blade which is clearly inspired by Poe's story ' The Pit and the Pendulum ' . Here we have solid proof that a cartoon gag-writer has actually read Poe ! Eventually , Felix is accepted into the feline fraternity ( a cat house ? ) by two cats wearing letterman sweaters bearing the letter C . . . but we're never told what this initial stands for . Cartoon Cat College , maybe . Like the other Felix cartoons from the Messmer period , ' Skulls and Sculls ' was made on a very low budget . The Felix toons were post-dubbed with unsynchronised sound effects and music . I was very intrigued that the soundtrack here included a few bars of a song ( very popular at the time , now obscure ) called ' Collegiate ' . This song was introduced by the Ritz Brothers during their vaudeville days ; it's now best known - - if it's remembered at all - - as the tune Chico Marx played during his piano routine in ' Horse Feathers ' : the one and only occasion when the Marx Brothers paid tribute to the Ritz Brothers . I wish that a few of the Ritz Brothers ' jokes had made their way into this cartoon . I'll rate ' Skulls and Sculls ' just . Try again , Felix .


Text2: Mosquitos and mascara , and a phony John O'Hara ' Yellow Jack ' is a goodish , proficiently made Hollywood drama which is weakened by several poor artistic decisions , and rendered absolutely ludicrous by one especially bad decision ( which I'll describe presently ) . The film deals with an inspiring true story in medical history , namely the attempts of the U . S . Army Medical Corps to find a cure for malaria , also known as yellow fever and ' yellow jack ' . This disease , spread by mosquitos , was so virulent in tropical regions that it seriously hampered the efforts to build the Panama Canal , as well as similar endeavours in Cuba and elsewhere . I'm only slightly familiar with the facts of this story , so I can't say how accurate this movie is . However , some of the actors in this cast are playing actual historic figures . . . notably the underrated Jonathan Hale as Major-General Leonard Wood , the officer in charge of the U . S . Army Yellow Fever Commission . Also excellent here is MGM stalwart Lewis Stone as Major Walter Reed , and Frank Puglia ( whom I usually dislike ) as Aristides Agramonte . Less impressive is Henry Hull , trying hard to be a serious "" ack-torr "" instead of portraying a believable character . Hull is cast as Jesse William Lazear , a physician who - - in real life - - deliberately infected himself by allowing ' loaded ' mosquitos to transmit the malaria virus to him . Hull's performance makes Lazear look ridiculous rather than heroic . The film takes place in Cuba in 1900 , hard upon the Spanish-American War . Dr Wood and his staff have found a potential treatment for malaria , but must test it on human subjects . Although one might expect Dr Wood to be the central character in this medical drama , the screenplay oddly emphasises one of his test subjects . ( This is one of the bad decisions which I've mentioned , but not the worst of them . ) Five medical volunteers are found ; the de-facto leader of these is played by Robert Montgomery , as an Irish-American trooper named John O'Hara . Is Montgomery playing an actual historic personage ? If not , it seems a strange decision for his character to be named John O'Hara , as this is the name of a best-selling novelist who was already well-known in 1938 . There are the usual Hollywood monkeyshines with history , notably in the casting of Virginia Bruce as an army nurse . An extremely beautiful blonde with great sex appeal but very little acting ability , Virginia Bruce is usually someone I'm delighted to see on the screen . Here , however , I find her beauty distracting . I can't believe that any woman as glammed-up as this would have been working as an army nurse in 1900 . During Louis B Mayer's reign as head of MGM , the studio had a firm policy that no leading lady would be depicted in an unglamorous manner . So , we get nonsense like this with army nurses getting the glamour treatment . No matter how steamy the swamps of Cuba might get , Virginia Bruce's mascara never wilts . She has a couple of very beautiful close-ups here . . . but that beauty works against the plausibility of this story . One of Montgomery's fellow guinea pigs , played by Buddy Ebsen , is a feller named Jelly Beans . I found this nickname hugely implausible . Did jelly beans even exist in 1900 ? Even if they did , ' Yellow Jack ' takes place largely in a military compound under military discipline : surely Ebsen's character would be referred to by his name or his rank , not some twee nickname . Ebsen was a talented character actor , but here he's been given a badly-written aw-shucks role , and he just can't make the character credible . The supremely bad decision was made by whoever decided that Montgomery should play his role with an Irish accent . Did I say Irish ? I meant ' Oirish ' . Montgomery's begorrah brogue is so full of Killarney blarney that it damages any plausibility in his characterisation , as well as the performances of other cast members in his scenes . Here we have a true story that ought to be dramatic and gripping on its own merits , yet Montgomery and Ebsen - - and , to a lesser extent , Henry Hull and Andy Devine - - are walking about with big red neon signs over their heads ,","{""output"": ""YES""}"
668,"Text1: May I have this dance of death ? Lucio Fulci is a usually very remarkable director who moves with the times , that's for sure . Following the huge success of stupid dancing movies , like "" Fame "" and "" Flashdance "" , it was an inexplicably popular trend in the early 1980's to insert overlong dancing sequences in horror films as well . Fulci was one of the first foreign filmmakers to cash in on this trend ; moreover , he dedicated a FULL movie to the intrigues and competition issues in typical dance academies ! The saddening result is a tame and boring movie , very much UN-Fulci and definitely not worth being listed among his other contemporary gore-highlights like "" The Beyond "" , "" New York Ripper "" and "" House by the Cemetery "" . Someone is killing off the pretty but very competitive girls of one and the same dancing class , only a couple weeks prior to an important recital . Her / his modus operandi is a lot gentler than usual in slashers , since the victims get paralyzed first and then stabbed in the heart with a hatpin . It's truly incomprehensible why Lucio Fulci , commonly known as the Godfather of Gore , decided to make the murders so soft & bloodless , sometimes even happening entirely off-screen ! What happened to my horror-idol with his normal passion for nastily cut throats or vile eyeball-stabbings ? Perhaps Fulci hoped to reach wider audiences like this or maybe his producers wanted to see a stylish murder-mystery for a change . The hunt for the killer's identity starts off interesting but , due to the repetitive and way too expanded dancing sequences , you stop caring about that pretty soon as well . Italian horror regular Ray Lovelock ( "" Autopsy "" , "" Let Sleeping Corpses Lie "" ) gives an adequate performance and most of the academy girls are lovely eye-candy ( showing a bit of flesh , too ) , but it constantly remains a dire film .

"" Supersonic Man "" . He always delivers very entertaining films and I can't bring myself to bash his work no matter how amateurish and cheap it looks . This "" Pieces "" is Simon's attempt to cash in on the very popular early 80's slasher trend . It blends the success elements of both "" Friday the 13th "" and "" the Texas Chainsaw Massacre "" , only the gore-factor is about ten times higher . In fact , "" Pieces "" easily could have been one of the most shocking movies ever if the gore wasn't so over the top and laughable ! This film is a series of repulsive massacres committed on a campus . The intro is supposedly set in the early 1940's , where a stern mother forbids her young son to play with puzzles that have naked women on them . So the boy just slaughters his mommy with an axe and forty years later he makes puzzles out of chopped off limbs , heads and torsos that he collects randomly on campus ! Z-horror legend Christoher George ( from Fulci's "" City of the Living Dead "" ) stars as the police lieutenant who even recruits college students to help him catch the maniac . The violence in "" Pieces "" truly surpasses your wildest imagination ! The killer here unquestionably is the most bloodthirsty creature in horror history since he even saws a girl in half ! This all may sound terrifying but , due to the poor production values , it's easy to digest and actually more funny than scary . The only slightly disturbing aspects are some of the killing-situations because they often look like guidelines for rapists and other sick puppies . For example , several killings are textbook crime-stuff like a girl alone in the park , or in an abandoned pool , the locker room and the aerobic-gym ! Not surprisingly the script was written by Joe D'Amato , who majored in sleaze . The acting is weak , the dubbing is painful and Simon wisely decided to replace all tension-building elements by blood , gore and more blood ! If you like the sound of rusty chainsaws and the images of knives cutting through human flesh . . . . here's your chance to go wild ! "" Pieces "" is an insane movie that has to be seen by all you deranged people !

Seeing how many people in the world live and enjoy themselves without a big house and a new car every year makes you a different person . Different enough that the superficiality that once was your life seems meaningless , and you start looking for something more . Larry ( Bill Murray ) found that his old life just wasn't fulfilling , and he tossed it aside to find something else . It is easy to say that he suffered from PTSD , but that is just something to sooth the minds of those that don't get it . It was fascinating to see the similarities between Larry's time - 1929 - and today . People are still committing suicide when they lose their fortunes . They cannot imagine life without fame and fortune . They fall apart in the face of tragedy . Larry was looking for more and that took him to the mountains of India . The cinematography was breathtaking in India . It is not hard to see one's insignificance amidst the majesty of the mountains . Even in a serious role , Murray had his comic genius ; it was just subtle . He was assisted very ably with Denholm Elliott , Catherine Hicks , and Theresa Russell .


Text2: Quite boring ! One might imagine that because Chris Columbus pulled off a faithful , yet exciting , movie adaptation of the first Harry Potter adventure that he would be able to it a second time . I'm sorry to report that he definitely has not . There are so many things wrong with this film and almost nothing to recommend it . More than two-and-a-half hours are spent rolling around in pure tedium - only the REALLY easily pleased will be entertained . The story has a slightly harder tone than the first , but there is nothing on display that will discomfort anyone of any age . Harry is being mentally tortured and starved by his muggle family during the summer holidays . He longs to go back to Hogwarts , but a Jar-Jar Binks lookalike elf , called Dobby , turns up in his bedroom and warns him that terrible things await him there . It's six of one and half a dozen of the other for Harry , as the Dursleys can be just as evil as anything the chamber of secrets has to offer . Once Harry gets to school - by means of a flying Ford Anglia - his fellow pupils are frozen with fear at the slightest glimpse of something evil . Harry hears voices in the walls that no one else can . And he suffers from the incompetence of the new Defence Against The Black Arts teacher , Gilderoy Lockhart ( Kenneth Branagh , totally miscast ) , who is not as funny as in the book . Five minutes after we are re-introduced to the students and teachers , the film slips into a clumsy mishmash of poorly staged scenes and bad acting . First time around it was easy to turn a blind eye to the amateurism of these kids . But there's no excusing it now . They've had a year to study their performances and see what was right and wrong - I know , I know , they're only kids . Trust me , none of them will be thanking the Academy anytime soon , which makes most of their scenes difficult to watch . Even with the support of such talent as Richard Harris , Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith - Robbie Coltrane is seriously underused - they cannot handle the weight of the material . Their acting seems a few seconds behind the adults and any scene with them together has big contrasts between veteran and novice . Steven Kloves ' screenplay tears out many pages and cuts so many corners from J . K . Rowling's book - once again , Rik Mayall is completely left out - in order to keep a tight pace . Yet the film still manages to be dull and boring . Nothing REALLY happens . And there are far too many pauses and silences in dialogue scenes - an absolute crime in a film of this length . With the exception of the chamber of secrets - which holds precious few secrets , I might add - no part of Hogwarts is explored . Almost the entire movie is shot in a generic corridor and you can bet your bottom dollar that for the other locations Columbus just shot the same set from a different angle . The lighting is conveniently yellow-candlelit , when he wants it to be mysterious , or comfortable , and green , or blue , when it should be menacing . Some credit should be given to the director for trying to make it a little bit darker than before . There's nothing visually disturbing , but the sight of a petrified Hermione and the angles he uses for the film's many and lengthy dialogue scenes echo film noir rather than tame , family friendly blockbuster . Aside from one quidditch match and the final showdown , there is nothing of interest . The mystery is very weak and straight-forward . There is too much talk and not enough action . It doesn't bode well for the rest of the series , which has so far been equally as dull . All the best elements that made the original entertaining are not here . Hagrid has less than five minutes screen time and Columbus exploits our disappointment by giving him a big applause at the end . This did not happen in the book and he only does it because that's his style , to force the audience to cry ( Home Alone , Bicentennial Man ) .

Mostly known for his erotic or perhaps pornographic photos its clear from this film that there is more to the man than just dirty pictures . Coming a cross as a charming rogue its clear that Araki loves what he's doing , which is photographing everyone and everything at all times . There is a comment by one of his fellow photographers to the effect that Araki is more than his erotic pictures and that there is nothing that he doesn't know about photography . Seeing his images whizzing by in the film its clear the statement is true as we see the vast range of his work that stretches from the mundane to flowers to portraits to porn to whatever else you can think of . He's an amazing man that I'm certain will worm his way into the hearts of anyone who sees the film . If there is a flaw to the film its perhaps its rapid fire , hip and happening style , which may capture Araki's manic energy , but some how short changes some of the images ( and ideas ) since many are too good to let get lost


Text2: Gives you the munchies ! Paul Bartel's ultra-low budgeted quickie is still one of the best black comedies ever made , even though I found it less funny than when I first saw it , approximately ten years ago now . Then again , it was my very first "" politically incorrect "" comedy and I've seen many others since ? This is a very charming film and the reasons why it works so well especially are the overly eccentric characters and the straight-faced acting performances of the talented B-cast . Writer / director Bartel and his favorite B-movie muse Mary Woronov star as an uptight and exaggeratedly square couple , the Blands , who're social outcasts in the wild L . A . region . Paul and Mary dream of opening their own little restaurant in the countryside but they have trouble financing it , while so many "" swingers "" waste their money on parties and bizarre sexual fetishes . After a first ? and accidental ? homicide , Paul and Mary find out that they could make easy money by luring more perverts to their apartment and kill them . The situation gets more complicated when Latino-crook Raoul discovers what the couple is doing . There aren't any special effects or gore and the set pieces aren't at all spectacular ? and yet this little gem is entertaining from start to finish ! Especially the first half ( when you make acquaintance with the bizarre Blands ) is terrific , with brilliant dialogues and offensive ? yet very clever ? black humor . It's obvious that Paul Bartel was an acolyte of the all-mighty Roger Corman , since he manages to deliver a fun movie without a large budget being required . The gags are simple - often not more than the sound of a frying pan hitting a human head ? but it works and the atmosphere is so tongue-in-cheek that you can't but love what you see . I do wish that the film had been a little longer , especially since the ending comes so abrupt ! "" Eating Raoul "" also contains many interesting trivia aspects , like for example the name of the co-writer , Richard Blackburn . Especially when you're familiar with Blackburn's other ( and only ) film "" Lemora : a Child's tale of the Supernatural "" , this screenplay is a giant change in style .

Text2: I Vaguely Remember This SPOILERS CHIMERA came out round about the same time as the BBC drama FIRST BORN which also dealt with the concept of genetically engineered apes , though to be honest they're not really compatible since FIRST BORN was more of an emotional drama while CHIMERA is a straight up and down horror / SF thrillerThe plot goes something like this : A nurse turns up at a fertility clinic to start a new job but things aren't what they seem . As the nurse is getting suspicions about the clinic , the staff , patients and eventually the nurse herself are murdered by Chad , a hybrid human . The nurse's boyfriend tries to solve the mystery as to what happened to herReading the above plot you might think this is a fairly entertaining thriller and it might have been but the story runs for four episodes and the above synopsis only covers the first one and a half episodes . As a matter of fact when the series was re-edited into a two hour teleplay the first hour is cut out plus another hour of running time and the story still makes sense which shows you how much padding there was in the first placeAfter the opening episode we're treated to sub plots like the secret service spooks wanting to keep everything under the raps and a couple of children befriending Chad who they call "" Mister Scarecrow "" . Strange how Chad seems to murder adults left right and centre but never harms children ? Oh as always in these type of stories we're treated to an amiguous ending of lots of little Chads lying in incubators I guess ITV should be congratulated on trying to break the BBC's monopoly on telefantasy but CHIMERA is very forgettable due to its over long running time and its cliches

I've read Bernanos ' novel and it was a perilous task to transpose it on the screen for it was a rich , undulating book . Bresson's piece of work makes it justice in its own special way and deeply involves the audience in the battle led by this young priest to keep the faith . Although the filmmaker later disowned this jewel because it didn't really answer his cinematographic demands , the most constitutive elements of his cinematographic approach are already here : a straightforward style , an austere black and white cinematography , a rigorous , hieratic directing which give many shots , the form of little paintings . Before he revolutionized the Seventh Art , Bresson cut his teeth as a painter and kept some principles and techniques for his vision of cinema . The actors or should I say the "" amateur models "" answer to Bresson's demands and thus adopt a deliberately bland acting even if Claude Laydu was a professional actor . He'll hold a secondary role in Andr√© Cayatte's "" Nous Sommes Tous Des Assassins "" ( 1952 ) and will be later the founder of a popular TV program for children : "" Bonne Nuit Les Petits "" . Let's also hail the shrewd narrative process which sees the priest write down in a textbook , his actions and his thoughts and the next shot showcases the written action . Through the young priest's inner turmoil and his confrontations with the inhabitants of the village , it's quite easy to detect one of Bresson's recurrent themes : the opposition between a subjective mind and a cruel objectivity . The young priest of Ambricourt is rejected by all the inhabitants who later will treat him as an alcoholic whereas he only asks for integration . The Count who seems at first on his side will later dismiss him after the death of the countess . And in the calvary lived by the young priest with its grueling tests , one inevitably thinks of the Way of the Cross experienced by the Christ . It's all the more evident as there are strong analogies like the moment when the priest falls in the muddy country and is received in Seraphita's home . In the end , a spiritual dimension shrouds a film full of grace and an emotion seizes the audience . You will never be able to exhaust all the treasures that Bresson's monument conceals . Like good wine , it improves with age and this is one that requires multiple viewings .

674,"Text1: PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES ( Mario Bava , 1965 ) Italian Version : ; U . S . Version : I had long wanted to watch this solitary foray into sci-fi territory by the great Bava : however , even if the film was released on R1 DVD ( now OOP ) and I had actually owned a copy of the slightly different English-language version ( in Pan-and-Scan ! ) on DivX for some time , I'm glad I waited to catch it for the first time via the Italian original ; just for the sake of comparison , my viewing of the R2 DVD was followed with that of the DivX ? and , for all kinds of reasons , the former blows the latter out of the water ! Anyway , the film itself is a minor classic of the genre though not without its faults : admittedly , the Italian brand of sci-fi cinema hasn't been exactly prolific or impressive ? still , Bava's effort is miles ahead of the ones that I've watched so far . To begin with , something about the English title : the aliens / monsters here are actually more zombies than vampires ( the fact that one never knows who can be trusted also links it with both INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS [ 1956 ] and THE LAST MAN ON EARTH [ 1964 ] ) ; hence , the original title ? TERRORE NELLO SPAZIO , i . e . TERROR IN SPACE ? is preferable , not only because it's more literary but it also lends mystery to the proceedings ( as the threat inherent in the plot line isn't categorized from the get-go ) . Curiously , Ib Melchior is credited as co-screenwriter on both the Italian and English versions ; early on , there's an overuse of nonsensical technical jargon ( which , in hindsight , takes away some of the surprise element from the ending ! ) , but this is thankfully downplayed in the film's latter stages . Of course , this being Bava , the look of the film ? actually similar to FORBIDDEN PLANET ( 1956 ) , it may well have inspired ALIEN ( 1979 ; with which it also shares much of the main theme ) ? is essential , and quite remarkable when considering the low-budget the director had at his disposal : the sets ? economical but undeniably stylish ? are very interesting , as are the various props on display ( that giant skeleton from an earlier civilization discovered on the planet is awesome ) ; while obviously modest , the visual / make-up effects are handled with great care and creativity ; the camera-work features an odd choice of angles mingled with Bava's typical zooms ; the pacing is generally terse but every opportunity to create mood and generate suspense is milked for all it's worth ; ultimately , the film's color scheme is so rich that one is almost tempted to turn off the audio and just allow himself to be immersed in the visuals ! Veteran Barry Sullivan makes for an imposing lead and Norma Bengell is his attractive co-star . Among the more notable sequences are the attack on Sullivan by his ' possessed ' crew ? very effective because it is unexpected ? and also the famous slo-mo rise of the shrouded monsters from their foggy graves . However , we also get a slightly confusing climax ( where the various characters become interchangeable due to their identical space-suits , especially when pursuing one another among the rocks ) ? but this is more than made up for by the double-twist at the end ( the first inspired , once again , by BODY SNATCHERS and the other deliciously chilling ) . As for the differences between the two versions of the film : the English-language edit has new and bland opening / closing shots , while some dialogue is either different or missing entirely ; worst of all here is Kendall Schmidt's horrid electronic score ( which , reportedly , had been added to the film by Orion and wasn't ported onto the R1 DVD ) ; on the other hand , the Italian print contains some minor extended bits ? but it's superior chiefly because of the more natural-sounding dubbing job . The only major complaint I have regarding the R2 DVD is that the audio is rather low ; the supplements are pretty minimal as well ( am I wrong in assuming that this won't be forthcoming as part of the Mario Bava series of R1 DVDs from Anchor Bay ? ) but , thankfully , the video has been recently remastered in anticipation of its screening during the Italian

Text2: DEDEE D ' ANVERS ( Yves Allegret , 1948 ) This was a contender for the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion ? facing such stiff competitors as THE FALLEN IDOL , David Lean's OLIVER TWIST , THE RED SHOES , THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and the eventual winner , Laurence Olivier's HAMLET . Incidentally , leading lady Simone Signoret and director Allegret were husband and wife at the time of shooting , but they divorced the following year . On the surface , the film does feel suspiciously like an inferior rehash of Marcel Carne's PORT OF SHADOWS ( 1938 ) ? not just its harbor setting and noir-ish ambiance , but the characterizations themselves : with Signoret neatly replacing Michele Morgan , Italian writer - turned - director - and - actor Marcello Pagliero ( he starred in Roberto Rossellini's ROME , OPEN CITY [ 1945 ] and later directed the similarly-titled ROMA , CITTA ' LIBERA [ 1946 ] ) instead of Jean Gabin , Bernard Blier standing in for Michel Simon , and Marcel Dalio essaying the role of the cowardly crook portrayed by Pierre Brasseur in the earlier film ! Even so , the four leads are all excellent in their respective roles : Signoret , especially , has a star-making turn as the optimistic bar hostess / streetwalker and Dalio is deliciously slimy as her wimpish pimp who is not above beating her to get the girl to extort more money from her clients , which he then squanders on his infallibly doomed schemes . The film is very well done in all departments ( an unexpected highlight is a brutal street scuffle early on , not to mention the vicious ending ) and makes one look forward to eventually sampling Allegret's other well-regarded efforts ? UNE SI JOLIE PETITE PLAGE ( 1949 ) , MANEGES ( 1950 ; also with Signoret and Blier , which I have on VHS but only in French ) and THE PROUD AND THE BEAUTIFUL ( 1953 ) . Ultimately , DEDEE D ' ANVERS has the disadvantage of being sort of stuck in the middle between two superior movies on a similar theme ? the afore-mentioned PORT OF SHADOWS and Jacques Becker's CASQUE D'OR ( 1952 ; also starring Signoret ) . While one has to be grateful to Italian TV channels for the loyalty they show towards French cinema in the way they keep pumping them out throughout their daily schedules , I have to complain about the dire state of the print quality on evidence here : the video is hazy in the extreme and is saddled besides with a tagged-on , anachronistically modernistic soundtrack !

Other than that , it's a pretty good time . W . C . Fields plays his usual character : a simple-minded weirdo going on and on about his exploits ( would people in the Old West have really been familiar with Afghanistan ? ) . But there's a reason that Mae West is the star . She plays a bitchy woman taking some real pride in her illegal activities , so much so that she calmly and self-assuredly sasses the court . But the real action takes off when Fields becomes sheriff . As for the news that Mae West and W . C . Fields didn't like each other , that doesn't change the movie . This film remains a piece of nice , short entertainment , despite the occasional racism . Even more interesting still is Margaret Hamilton's character : she basically plays a human version of the Wicked Witch of the West ! So , this is far from the funniest movie , but certainly an important part of cinematic history . Worth seeing . Flower Belle Lee and Cuthbert J . Twillie . What a whacked-out pair of names .

678,"Text1: Attention Parents ! ! Butterfly Wings is a heavily symbolic film that focuses on one family as representative of the society in which they live . The film opens with a hospital scene in which a clearly frustrated grandfather receives the news that he has a new granddaughter , not a grandson . His daughter in law has yet again been unable to provide his son with an heir , reflecting the favoring of boys in the society in Spain at the time of the film . This scene sets up the stage for the rest of the film , which presents a picture of the home life of one family , which is influenced by their society . The movie is an exploration of a patriarchal society through female central characters . The daughter born at the beginning of the film is Amy , a little girl with dark hair and startling blue eyes who is neglected by her mother , Carmen , who seems to want an heir for her husband even more than he does . Carmen eventually gets pregnant again , and is upset because she is afraid that she will have another girl . It is significant here that the grandfather was introduced as the one who is strictly following the traditions of the patriarchal society in which they live , and then the mother continues this strictness even more than the father does . Indeed , the father plays a fairly minor role in the film , if only because he is so complacent about the gender of his children . Rather than being desperate to have the more socially acceptable male child , he accepts whatever gender they get as a blessing , as God's will . ( spoilers ) When the mother has the next child , however , it is a boy , and this is where all the real trouble starts . Amy's mother is so elated that she has had a boy that she gives him all of her attention , not even paying any attention to Amy even when she is literally bleeding from her head . This is the major turning point in the film , where the damage has been done to Amy by her mother , and her consciousness takes a turn for the worst , which is most clearly evident in a comparison between the butterflies that she drew and made up to this point in the film and those that she makes for the rest of the movie . There is a great dream sequence soon after the son is born where Carmen dreams that Amy picks the baby up out of the crib and drops him out the window to his death far below . There is soon a situation where Carmen finds the baby gone , Amy is out on the balcony that she dropped the baby off of in the dream , and Carmen freaks out thinking that it has come true . She starts beating Amy , who takes it silently , and then Gabriel , the father , walks in the room carrying the baby and asks what's going on . Carmen's fate is pretty much sealed at the point where Amy smothers the baby , imitating something she saw on TV , if I remember correctly . This is the point where parents should really pay attention , because Carmen's rough parenting style combined with the oppressive patriarchal society in which the family lived led to the rejection of Amy as a member of the family , her desire to escape into television , and her ultimate effort to get rid of the new baby so that she can be noticed again . Amy smothers her little brother , and Carmen begins to go insane . It is significant that the only time that we ever see Amy smile as a young girl is when her little brother squeezes her finger , right before she smothers him . She did not do this maliciously out of anger or hatred for her brother , she was too young for that , she didn't realize the gravity of what she was doing . All she knew was that this was something that her mother loved more than her , and it caused her to be ignored . She probably felt that if she got rid of it , her mother would be mad at her for a while and then things would go back to the way they were before . Amy's life is packed with tragedy from the moment we meet her , as an unwanted little girl . She has an abusive mother , was born into a society that looks down on females , she unknowingly

Text2: "" You look good enough to eat . "" I liked it . Masters of Horror : The Washingtonians starts as Mike ( co-writer Jonathon Schaech ) & Pam Franks ( Venus Terzo ) along with their 10 year old daughter Amy ( Julia Tortolano ) drive to the house left to Frank by his recently deceased Grandmother , once there they start to explore their new home . Amy decides to look in the basement & discovers a large painting of George Washington the founder of the United States , upon closer inspection Mike finds a letter & a fork made of bone behind a tear in the canvas . The letter talks of Washington engaging in cannibalistic activities , Mike realises that if the letter turns out to be genuine then it could rewrite American history but so do a group of loons called Washingtonians who will do anything to get the letter back . . . This Canadian American co-production was episode 12 from season 2 of the generally hit-and-miss Masters of Horror TV series , directed by Peter Medak I actually thought The Washingtonians was a definite hit & I rather liked this darkly comic story despite it's largely negative reviews . The tongue-in-cheek script by Richard Chizmar & star Jonathon Schaech was based on a short story of the same name by Bentley Little & has a cool twisted central premise , the thought of George Washington being a cannibal & there being people who call themselves Washingtonians who still carry on the tradition is an interesting & perverse idea that I thought made for a very watchable & entertaining 60 odd minutes . However it's far from perfect , the tight time scale means it feels a bit rushed no more so than the frustrating ending because the episode was going really well as far as I was concerned & then all of a sudden everything just seemed to end abruptly without a satisfactory conclusion which is the only real criticism I have with The Washingtonians & I deify anyone to say The Washingtonians is a worse Masters of Horror episode than The Screwfly Solution with a straight face . Director Medak is yet another strange choice to direct a so-called Masters of Horror episode , apart from The Changeling ( 1981 ) , a Tales from the Crypt episode called The New Arrival ( 1992 ) & Species II ( 1998 ) he hasn't exactly been prolific within the horror genre has he ? He does fine here , there's not many scares but at least he keeps things moving & there's a nice atmosphere to this one especially the cool juxtaposition at the end when amidst all the splendour & opulence of The Washingtonians posh surroundings they indulge in very vulgar acts of cannibalism . As usual there's some top gore , there's a decapitation at the start & the expected various cannibal scenes including someone eating chunks of flesh from a severed foot , a huge tray with a chopped up body on it , there's intestine eating & plenty of blood splashed around . Techncially these Masters of Horror episodes are very well made & don't look like the cheap made-for-TV show's that they are in reality . The special effects are excellent as always & it has high production values . The acting was alright but the 10 year girl annoyed like a lot of child actors do . The Washingtonians seems to have a bad reputation which frankly I couldn't give a toss about because I liked it & that's all that matters to me & it's as simple & straight forward as that , I reckon it's well worth an hour of your life .

Sometimes these old black and whites can really have interesting stories . This was true to my expectations . This was a Jules Dassin film . He was one of the most important directors in post-WWII America . Unfortunately he got caught up in the Red Scare led by Senator McCarthy and was blacklisted . he moved to Europe , where he continued to make movies . His most influential film was the heist movie Rififi , which inspired a genre of movies including Ocean's Eleven and Mission : Impossible . The movie stars Conrad Veidt , who is himself a very interesting character . Most movie goers would remember him as Gestapo Maj . Strasser in the classic Casablanca . This is interesting because he was a staunch anti-Nazi who was himself chased out of Germany under threat of assassination . He was to play Dracula in 1931 , but Bela Lugosi got the job . His performance in The Man Who Laughs , was used as the basis for "" The Joker "" in the early Batman . Veidt give a good performance as a twin whose brother is a Nazi agent . he kills him and takes his place to fight against the Nazi underground in America .

Text2: Where was Bernie Goetz when we really needed him SPOILERS Until I saw the movie "" Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer "" in the late 1980's I never saw a major movie out of Hollywood more vicious and disturbing then "" The Incident "" . Two brutal and vicious thugs Joe Ferrone & Arti Connors , Tony Musante & Martin Sheen , after brutally murdering a man , Ben Levi , coming home from work at night get on a New York City subway train and terrorize all the passengers on it . Like in most New York City movies the train contains every nationality age and social group and even sexual preference on it and Joe & Arti treat them all just about equally . What was very phony about the movie is that the subway car had something like a dozen passengers on it and nobody or no group of the passengers tried at attack and subdue the two thugs that until the very end . The thugs didn't even show or pull out any weapons and when they did the only weapon they had was a switchblade knife . Even more so they not only brutalized everyone on the subway car they nauseatingly humiliated all the women who were on the train in full sight of their husbands or boyfriends ! with the men doing absolutely nothing to help them ! I couldn't help wondering what the wives and girlfriends of these wimps did after this hell was over did they still stay with them ? Another thing that was a little bit off was that both Joe & Arti went from person or couple to couple abusing and humiliating each one as it they were working on an assembly line . The two jumped on a poor gay man Ken , Robert Fields , and brutalized him so badly that he looked like he lost his mind and was left in a catatonic state with nobody on the train lifting as much as a finger to help the poor man . There was also a black couple Arnold and Joan Robinson , Brock Peters and Ruby Dee , who were about to leave the train on their stop at 125th street in Harlem but Arnold insisted that his wife stay with him on the train so he can see the "" show "" , how stupid can one get ? Being the only two blacks on the train Arnold was especially singled out by the two white thugs for special treatment . The big strapping black militant was left whimpering and crying like a baby in front of his wife Joan and a train full of whites whom Arnold showed earlier in the movie nothing but hatred contempt and scorn for . The outrages continued until Felix , Beau Bridges , A GI on leave with a broken arm in the big city just couldn't take it any more when Joe started molesting Mr . & Mrs . Wilks Ed McMahon & Diana Vander Vilis , young daughter . Felix finally took the law into his own hands by smashing Joe's face in with his plaster cast that he had on his broken arm , that it took a dentist to pull all of Joe's teeth out of it . Felix then cornered and kicked Arti so hard between his legs that if he were a football he would have traveled at least fifty yards for a field goal with Felix getting a knife right in his gut , and as usual in this movie , with nobody coming to his aid until it was too late or better yet until the police finally came to the "" rescue "" . Seventeen years later , after the movie "" The Incident "" was released , on the early afternoon of December 22 , 1984 another "" Incident "" happened on the Subway in New York City that was like the movie but with a much better ending . Bernie Goetz was on a crowded # 2 subway train minding his own business when he was confronted by four muggers wanting his wallet . Bernie then pulled something out of his jacket pocket but it wasn't a Christmas gift and put the four would-be subway Christmas shoppers out of action for a long long time . I always thought that Bernie saw the movie "" The Incident "" and knew what just to expect on the NYC subway and also made sure that he would be ready for it when it came .

685,"Text1: THE SLENDER THREAD ( Sydney Pollack , 1965 ) The late Sydney Pollack tried his hand at several different genres and succeeded in most ; since he never demonstrated an individualistic style ( for many he was the antithesis of an auteur ! ) , he could adapt himself to virtually anything ( and Pollack often set his sights on grand themes ) ‚Äì though the end result would always be somewhat artificial ( if undeniably slick ) because of the director‚Äôs impersonal approach ! Anyway , for his debut film , he settled on an intimate melodrama ‚Äì shot on location in glorious black-and-white ( incidentally , all his subsequent work would be in color ) . The plot is simple : Sidney Poitier is a student who works nights at a Seattle Crisis Clinic ; on one occasion , a call comes in where a wealthy socialite at the end of her tether ( Anne Bancroft ) declares she has deliberately overdosed on barbiturates ! She phoned not so much because she wanted help but rather so that someone will know of her outcome ; Poitier , however , determines to keep her on the line ‚Äì while he sets in motion a complex operation in order to trace Bancroft‚Äôs whereabouts and save her life . For about the first third of the film , Bancroft barely appears : we only hear her world-weary voice booming across the room at the clinic , Poitier having switched the call to the loudspeaker ; eventually , she starts to let her hair down and , in intermittent flashbacks , we see her movements during the last few days ( which boils down to her alienation from familial cords due to a past mistake which has come back to haunt her ) . While this was certainly a way to do it , I‚Äôm baffled as to why we never cut to where Bancroft is now until the last act : consequently , we have to contend with a fair bit of padding during the ‚Äòre-enactments‚Äô ( which could have easily been covered via dialogue delivered by the heroine ) ! That said , I guess it was a conscious decision on Pollack‚Äôs part to ‚Äòopen up‚Äô the drama ( not merely to include other characters ‚Äì most prominently , Steven Hill as the woman‚Äôs husband ‚Äì but also to utilize a number of exteriors , where he was able to exercise a keen eye for realistic detail ) . Still , the film compels attention despite an essentially contrived central situation : for instance , at this point , it‚Äôs best not to go into how Bancroft manages to remain lucid for so long or , even more importantly , why she just doesn‚Äôt hang up on Poitier ; and what about the plausibility of the latter‚Äôs temper-tantrums ( to the exasperation of clinic psychiatrist Telly Savalas ! ) to coerce the woman into reacting , thus hanging on to life in spite of herself ? But that‚Äôs Hollywood for you . . . and , in a talky film such as this , the emphasis is on the writing ( by Stirling Silliphant ) and the acting ( Bancroft is typically excellent and Poitier‚Äôs contribution , amounting to a variation on his PRESSURE POINT [ 1962 ] role , just as good if slightly overstated in the long run ) . Even so , as a counter-balance to the ongoing histrionics , reasonable suspense ‚Äì aided by up-to-date methods of detection ‚Äì is generated throughout by the race-against-time to locate Bancroft . At the end of the day , THE SLENDER THREAD emerges as a quite impressive ( and generally still powerful ) first outing ‚Äì recalling the gritty work of many a contemporary film-maker who , like Pollack , had emerged from TV .


Text2: People That Live The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good ( or great ) as you can get , especially considering that it was shot in 33 days . But it often gets nailed for two scenes , one absent from the film , the other changed drastically . No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast . If the scene had been shot in 1939 ( or even suggested ) , the movie would never have been released . The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat , what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle , and "" we're the people that live . "" That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s . Of course tragedies had been filmed for years , but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate . Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest close-knit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare . We need to look at art in the context of its time . From the Marxist perspective that Steinbeck used in writing the novel , Tom Joad ( Henry Fonda ) is the protagonist but the two most important characters are Ma Joad ( Jane Darwell ) and Casey the Preacher ( John Carradine ) . Ma represents what Marx called "" false consciousness , "" the tendency to attribute our misery to our own flaws , to bad luck , or God's will . Ma Joad's solution is retrograde - - to hold the "" fambly "" together . Casey , on the other hand , discovers "" class consciousness . "" It's not our fault . The flaw is systemic , and the solution lies in correcting the inequities in the system . Our allegiance has to transcend groups like the family and embrace all the exploited workers . The film endorses not Marx's revolution but a milder form of socialism - - the government-run labor camp with its democratic "" sanitary units "" , and the emerging union movement with its collective bargaining . Steinbeck's polemic is more acid . The novel has a reference to the extremely wealthy William Randolph Hearst ( better known as Charles Foster Kane ) who is described as have "" a mean face and a mouth like a ahole . "" There aren't many references to communism either in the novel or the film , just a few remarks about "" Who is these Reds , anyways ? "" Still pretty bold stuff for the 1930s with the public in one of its periodic Bolshevik scares ! No need for anxiety , though . By the late 1930s the Great Depression was easing up , and World War II was about to bring it to an end . Bakersfield now looks as if Tom Joad had made a successful escape and decided to open a chain of organic food stores . This is a marvelous film . To single out just one shot , note when the Joads drive through the first starving Hooverville . The camera is mounted on the front of the old truck and travels slowly , without any cuts or dialog , through groups of wary , singularly ratty looking people , men and women , young and old , some resembling photos of criminals from old Police Gazettes , who "" don't look none too prosperous . "" If nothing else , the film is a valuable corrective to the current view that people are poor because they're lazy . How did one third of a nation become so terribly lazy in the years following the 1929 stock market crash ?

Chance desperately tries to see and speak with Heavenly , appealing to her Aunt Nonnie ( Mildred Dunnock ) , but it leads to more trouble than he bargained for . Page is a powerhouse as Alexandra , more glamorous than we're used to seeing her and as sloppy a drunk and druggie as you'll ever find . Alexandra's a selfish user , and she's got the technique down pat . The role of Chance , another selfish user , came fairly early on in the handsome Newman's career - he came very close to being typecast as these fast-talking amoral men . In those days , Newman struggled with a lack of emotional availability and these roles fit him beautifully . Thankfully he grew to encompass parts in films such as he had in "" The Verdict "" and became one of our greatest American actors . Madeline Sherwood , so effective in "" Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , "" is equally good here as Boss Finley's girlfriend ; her scene with Begley in her hotel room is truly terrifying . Begley is fantastic , mean as dirt , as is Torn as his equally cruel son . And "" Desperate Housewives "" fans will be interested to see a slim , pretty Shirley Knight as Heavenly , a somewhat vapid role for such a strong actress . The DVD has a screen test for Chance by Rip Torn , who would later marry Page . He and Page perform a scene between Alexandra and Chance from the play - though the scene is in the film , it has been changed slightly . It's total stage acting , quite different from the film , but both are excellent , Torn giving Chance a lot of intensity . Though in those days he was very good-looking , he probably didn't come off as enough of a boy toy for the producers . It's a very interesting extra and well worth seeing , as is this somewhat watered-down "" Sweet Bird of Youth . ""


Text2: Because it's there Because it's there - well , I suppose that's a good enough reason to climb a mountain . It was motivation enough to climb Everest . However , in "" The White Tower "" everyone has a different reason for wanting to climb a magnificent mountain peak in the Swiss Alps that defeated the father of Carla Alten ( Valli ) , a young woman whose goal in climbing is closure . Glenn Ford , as Ordway , is finally convinced to take the climb - his goal is Valli . And so it goes , as six climbers start on a ascent to the top . This is a gorgeous Technicolor film that was intended to be seen in a theater . The scenery is magnificent , and the cast of climbers is excellent : Ford , Valli , Claude Rains , Lloyd Bridges , Oscar Homolka , and Cedric Hardwicke . Like Walter Slezak in "" Lifeboat , "" Bridges plays the Aryan Nazi , Hein , who hasn't forgotten his Fuhrer . He puts himself in competition with Ordway ( Ford ) , the American looking for some post-war peace , and he hates Raines and Homolka for being the "" weaklings "" who are holding the team back . Rains is an alcoholic writer - he is unhappily married and wants to feel again ; Hardwicke was a friend of Valli's father and wants to support her quest . Homolka is a reluctant guide who goes on the trip in spite of himself . Valli is much more vivacious and outdoorsy than she was in "" The Third Man "" or "" The Parradine Case . "" Ford always has such a wonderful quality - shy , with a gentle manner , beautiful smile and that disarming , soft voice - how any woman could resist him is a mystery , though I give Valli credit for trying . He'll be 90 on May 1 , bless his heart . The film has some suspenseful moments and is definitely worth a watch .

688,"Text1: Ahead of its time "" Mystere Alexina "" is a highly understated movie . Although it is a true story , the facts it depicts were risqu√© and its plea for the right to be different has a contemporary feel . Ren√© F√©ret's directing was certainly influenced by that of Robert Bresson , but he occasionally shows a certain warmth which the master never allows himself . Circa 1850 : Alexina who spent her youth in a completely female world ( a convent , then a training college ) becomes a schoolteacher in a small village . She feels she's different . She does not have her periods . Worse , she falls in love with her colleague ( a woman of course ) . Pretty soon , they become lovers , as Alexina feels more and more the man in her / him . But one of their pupils ( it recalls Wyler's "" the children's hour "" ; the difference is that here it is a true rumor ) reveals theirrelationship . Alexina loses her job and has a physical exam . It would seem that she is an hermaphrodite . There's the rub . The nineteenth century society is not prepared to accept such a "" monster "" . Victor , "" the wild child "" ( see Truffaut's movie ) was not dangerous for the society-he had appeared earlier in the century - because he was sexless and not really clever . Alexina wants to marry her / his lover . But the world in which she lives is still dominated by religion and puritanism . The biology lesson is revealing : when she tells her pupils about the frog reproduction , Alexina does not mention that the male inseminates the eggs ( and however it happens in the water ) . An impressive scene shows Alexina driven out of the confessional by the priest after she's told him the "" truth "" . Philippe Vuillemin gives a cesar-caliber performance . He is absolutely mind-boggling : even more credible as a woman ! Give this movie a chance ! It deserves it !


Text2: Mr . Crosby Steals Film From Miss Davies When she discovers that the crooner she adores is GOING HOLLYWOOD , a liberated school teacher dogs his steps all the way to the Studio sound stages . Marion Davies tries her hardest to entertain in this tinsel town spoof , but neither the script ( based on a story by the celebrated Frances Marion ) nor the direction give her much leeway . Raoul Walsh seems a curious choice to direct this kind of film , but he must have had William Randolph Hearst's approval or he never would have been given the assignment . The trouble is that Marion has little chance to be anything other than sweet & pleasant - when finally given the opportunity to do a wicked spoof of co-star Fifi D'Orsay , she's terrific . Unfortunately , moments like that come all too rarely . Leading man Bing Crosby comes off rather better , showing the casual charm that would make him a huge star . And he gets to sing some fine tunes by Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed , including the classic ? Temptation ' and the fun ? We'll Make Hay While The Sun Shines . ' Although his character is a bit of a cad , Bing never fails to deliver the goods to the audience . A troika of character performers add sparkle to the proceedings : earnest Stuart Erwin as a film producer ; caustic Ned Sparks as a dictatorial director ; and tomboy Patsy Kelly as a plain-talking gal trying to break into the movies . Movie mavens will spot Clara Blandick & Nora Cecil as two of the ossified instructors at the girls ' school , and Sterling Holloway as a recording mike technician - all uncredited . Oddly , this film about the Hollywood movie business takes time out to poke fun at contemporary radio stars . Mimic singers & impressionists , The Radio Rogues will provide a smile to viewers with very long memories . Time has not dealt kindly with Marion Davies . Almost forgotten today , when remembered at all it is usually as a sort of footnote to history or object of scandal . Her life certainly was colorful , and as chatelaine of America's most amazing private estate she did circulate amidst powerful circles . But to remember her as only the bimbo blonde mistress of the country's mightiest media baron is patently unfair . While much of the blame can go to Orson Welles ' spoof of Davies in CITIZEN KANE ( which he was to admit he regretted towards the end of his life ) it must be stated emphatically that Marion was not a no-talent actress with few friends & even fewer brains , whose career was destroyed by her stammer , leaving her to spend lonely years in great , hulking empty castles . In reality , Davies was a bright , vivacious lady who charmed & captivated such diverse guests as George Bernard Shaw & Winston Churchill throughout her 33-year liaison with Hearst . Adored by her friends and a fierce cadre of fans , Davies was renowned for her tireless generosity and charitable good works . Her speech impediment never affected her screen acting and her undeniable talent was evident to any who were willing to assess her performances honesty and look past the scandal . Davies had to have been embarrassed by the Hearst empire's relentless pushing of her career . She knew this left her open to ridicule & mockery , doubtless contributing to her scarcely concealed alcoholism . But she eventually relinquished her film pursuits in order to care for the aging Hearst , and after his death in 1951 she showed herself to be an astute businesswoman during the remaining ten years of her life . It is only now , with the passage of much time & the restoration of her old movies , that it is becoming easier to acknowledge the contributions & cinematic expertise of Miss Marion Davies .

689,"Text1: Zwartboek or Black Book Delivers Terrific film dealing with the German occupation of Holland during World War 11 . The film is fabulous due to the exciting plot twists . Even though many of the good guys turn out to be villains , the film is done so well that you just don't mind having to think a little . Imagine , a Jewish woman , whose parents and brother were gunned down by Nazis , is eventually accused of being a traitor . An admirable job is done to depict her as this , especially since she was the one who helped to wire German headquarters while working for the Dutch underground . When it's discovered by the Nazis , what she is up to , they fabricate stories which they know will be heard by the underground . The cast of German and Dutch actors are wonderful . One question I have is since when was escaping to Belgium considered a panacea ?

John Heard portrays the airline pilot who apparently led quite a secret life . Christine Lahti does quite well as the wife who finds out plenty when her husband and 104 others are killed in a plane crash . Lahti sounds like a serious Carol Burnett when she speaks . What was the point of Heard never revealing that his mother was still living . Why did he say that she died when he was 9 ? With the government investigating the tragedy , is this really the time for the teenage daughter to admit to Lahti that last year , at age 14 , she had intercourse . Come on . A scene before , she is hysterical with grief over her father's death . The interesting part of the story is merely glossed over . I am talking about Heard's involvement with the IRA in Northern Ireland . His newly discovered second wife and family is a shocker adequately dealt with . No wonder Lahti throws away her wedding ring at the spot where the plane went down . Anyone would do the same thing .

It's done far more professional and has a better visual look over it , making this movie more convincing and compelling to watch than the first movie from the Za ginipiggu-series . This movie really looks - and is made like a movie , rather than a cheap and lame snuff-wannabee . The concept remains the same though ; A young woman is being kidnapped and held captive , with the pure purpose to torture her in as many different ways as imaginable . It's a rather graphic and gory movie , with some convincing effects but unfortunately not so convincing sound effects . Sometimes the sound effects are unintentionally hilarious , which does take away some of the power of the movie its visuals . Of course it's a totally pointless sadistic gory shocker but the fans of gore simply don't need more . The movie for them will be a memorable and ' enjoyable ' experience . The movie is quite short and also the torturing itself is ended pretty quickly when the torturer simply decides to switch over to dismembering his victim pretty early on . The movie could had worked out more interesting and intriguing had it been a bit longer and taken some more time to build up to its ' climax ' . Better than the first one but still a pretty pointless movie to watch .

691,"Text1: Unbelievable . First of all , I had no idea there was this kind of obsession with Rubik's cubes . I knew that there was sort of a whole sub-culture revolving around this peculiar little toy , but I thought that was back in the 80s and maybe early 90s . What is amazing to me is not that the Rubik's obsession is alive and well or even that there continue to be people trying to come up with new and exciting ( bizarre ) ways to solve it , what is amazing to me is that there are actually people , two of which are featured in this short video , whose job title is "" Rubik's Cube Documentarian . "" I really had no idea that there was enough history to the Rubik's cube to necessitate people to have careers documenting and studying it . What do these people do on a daily / weekly basis ? Head on in to the office and see if anyone has shaved a few hundredths of a second off of the standing record ? I feel like I know about 75 % of all I need to know about the thing from watching this six minute video ! On the other hand , there is definitely a lot of fascinating information here . There are some statistics given about the toy , such as that it has 43 "" quintillion "" different possible positions , and that if you were to move one piece every second , it would take 1 , 400 million million years to create all of the different combinations . Now , if I have my zeroes and commas calculated correctly , that's 1 , 400 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 years . Unbelievable ! ! This will be why so many people have developed the obsessions that they have , some of which last years and years and years and have even spawned medical conditions and support groups . I always thought that the Rubik's cube was just a fad that I missed out on , since I was never any more than passively interested . Maybe because I could never figure the thing out and would lose interest before I made much progress . This video makes me glad that I never got very seriously into it ! One thing that is hugely interesting to me is that because of the Hungarian architecture professor who invented the puzzle , Hungary was able to rise out of Communism in the 1980s . This is quite an interesting statement to me because at the moment I am living in the heart of China , and the current government is intensely Communist and fiercely perpetuates the mythology of Mao Tse-tung , who is quite literally revered like a God here despite being personally responsible for more deaths ( more than 70 million ) than any single person in the history of mankind . Communism is mentioned in this video as sort of something that Hungary escaped from , which is quite a statement in the environment in which I find myself . Also interesting , and a little disturbing , is the idea of solving the Rubik's cube blindfolded . A kid named Leyan Lo is the current world record holder for the fastest blindfold solve . When I heard that , the first thing I thought is that the kid really needs to get a life , but it is definitely pretty interesting to watch these people's hands working so fast that you can hardly see the fingers move , it's incredible . Also , go to Youtube and look up "" cup stacking world record . "" This is another "" super-geeky "" fad , as it's described in the video , that is pretty amazing . So whether or not these people need to get a life is not really anyone's business , I guess . Whatever blows your hair back , as they say . But one thing is definitely certain , these people have WAY too much time on their lightning - fast hands .


Text2: Good film "" Union Station "" is a realistic 1950 film starring William Holden , Nancy Olson , Jan Sterling and Barry Fitzgerald . It was released after "" Sunset Boulevard "" so by the time it came out , Holden had actually moved up another level of stardom . Rudolph Mate directed the film in a quasi-documentary way , showing all levels of an attempt to rescue a kidnapped blind girl ( Allene Roberts ) , the daughter of Olson's wealthy boss . Holden plays the detective in charge of Union Station , and he doesn't like the idea of anybody messing with his turf . There are some very exciting scenes , particularly the one on the train , which as someone mentioned , very likely inspired "" The French Connection . "" Holden gives a strong , macho performance , which makes the scene where he visits Olson in her home extra delightful , as he becomes embarrassed when her mother fusses over him . It's amazing that after Golden Boy , he toiled in so many films beneath his ability . Jan Sterling is the gangster's girlfriend with a heart - it's a small but showy and sympathetic role . Lyle Bettger is the villain , and he's slime all the way through . The only problem with the film is the kidnap victim herself , Lorna , who screams non-stop . I'm surprised her father wanted her back , but you know how it is with parents . Really holds your interest . What a hunk Holden is . Highly recommended .

But because of the many characters in the movie , none of them really get developed strongly enough , simply because there is no room for it . It makes the movie a bit of a shallow experience as well . That is what happens when you have a movie filled with an all-star cast . But the movie is an extremely well made one , with some outstanding actors , which definitely saves the movie and still makes this a greatly and amusing watchable one .

It put an interest to see it and I found it at a decent price so I said to myself I'd give it a shot . "" Urban Legend "" , as you should know , is part of that cycle of films that spurned successfully from the huge popularity of Wes Craven's SCREAM . This one is pretty silly , but far more entertaining than it should be . Quality camera-work and craftsmanship try to make-up for a screenplay which asks a lot from our viewer . We are supposed to accept the fact that this serial killer can move from one location to another in quick speed ( with some of the deaths desiring elaborate planning and cunning ) . . and in a torrent rain-storm that would rival anyone having to stage death traps at just the right moment with success . Alicia Witt is the heroine who knew the murdered Natasha Gregson Wagner from High School . Around her are friends dying in different ways by a psychopath wearing a huge coat with a fur head covering that provides us with no way of seeing the killer's face . The gimmick of this slasher flick is that people are dying according to elaborately staged Urban Legends . Witt will turn to college-newspaper journalist Jared Leto for help . The film is loaded with the faces of youth television stars such as Joshua Jackson , Michael Rosenbaum & also features the likes of Robert Englund ( as a professor of folklore ) , John Neville ( as the college dean ) , scene-stealing Loretta Devine ( as the security guard modeling herself after blaxploitation heroine Pam Grier ) , Tara Reid ( as a radio-host who looks great with meat on her bones ) , & Rebecca Gayheart ( as Witt's best friend ) .

It has it all - a great narrative , great acting , great score , and it is emotionally involving .

Vertigo is one of those films that is impossible to top , so it is just a waste of time to try . Here is my experience during Suzhou River , after having enjoyed the first 30 minutes or so immensely : I hear the score sampling Bernard Herrmann's Vertiginous theme , and see the camera quoting the film , and my mind immediately jumped back on my dreamlike memories of Vertigo . It's as if Suzhou River disappeared . Near the end , the film started to become a little more original , and my daydreams faded , but I was pretty lost at that point . Don't get me wrong . Suzhou River is still a fine film . I would actually like someone to remake most of it , taking out the Vertigo homage and inserting something more original .

One thing I do admire about Pacino the actor is the fact he chooses quality over quantity . Look at De Niro in the past 10 years who's appeared in some absolute crap like WE'RE NO ANGELS , THE FAN , and MEET THE PARENTS which leads me to believe that the star of TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL must be another actor called Robert De Niro . Pacino can never to accused of slumming it , and you know you'll always be guaranteed an intense performance from him . Boy does Pacino give it 100 % here . Amazingly Pacino didn't even receive an Oscar nomination for this which is the best performance by an American actor from that year ( So much better than Tom Hanks ) , and he's ably supported by Luiz Guzman and Viggo Mortensen and proving perhaps for the first time what an accomplished actor he is Sean Penn who was also strangely snubbed at the Oscar nominations .

As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a storm of naysayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

699,"Text1: Run-of-the-mill Disney outing . This one is an adequate time-filler , but , surely , it won't be hard to find many other films to watch when you just need to sit back and spend two hours painlessly . It's an uninspired , undistinguished Disney comedy , with OK performances but a predictable storyline . The brightest moments are contributed by David Niven , who gives some class to the whole production .


Text2: A little heavy , but with astonishing performances . A well-observed , well-made drama ( with occasional comedic moments ) , that may not be exactly "" high art "" ( it's neither profound nor original ) , but DOES feature some great acting and manages to pull you in . Debra Winger gives an extraordinary performance ; she has a naturalness and expressiveness that you rarely see on the screen . When her character is happy , her whole face brightens up and her joy becomes infectious ; when she's sad or confused or embarrassed , the emotions come across strongly , although she never goes over the top . Considering that she lost the Oscar to her co-star , Shirley MacLaine , who is reasonably good but far more one-note , I'd say we had a major Academy Award injustice there . Jack Nicholson is fun to watch and has some amusing lines , and most supporting roles , like those played by John Lithgow and Danny De Vito , are also first-rate and completely believable . So overall it's a good film , directed almost flawlessly , although in the final 20 minutes it needlessly wallows in melodrama . ( )

A child like that , I met one three or four years ago . The French title is "" la rumeur "" ( the rumor ) , and more than the right to be different , the main subject of "" children's hour "" ( check the title ) is slander which can destroy lives . Wyler's movie gains , in spite of its dated side , an universal meaning because slander can be about anything and can lead anybody to humiliation , despair even death . And even in 2005 , are all the parents prepared to accept a gay or a lesbian teacher for their child ? Wyler was not happy with the first version ( these three ) which avoided the gay side . In 1961 , it was a very courageous move to deal with a scandalous situation . The young audience will probably find it hard to understand what all the screaming was about . They have got to remember that the Production Code Administration Office ( PCA ) only began to change in 1958 . "" The PCA finally altered its attitude toward "" sexual perversion "" ( sic ) - despite controversies over films like "" suddenly last Summer "" - when such major studio movies as "" the children's hour "" and "" advise and consent "" dealt with the subject . "" But it was 1966 before the code was revised , this time drastically . Excellent performances by the two leads , extremely moving , fine support by James Garner and Miriam Hopkins . Shirley McLaine is to be praised because she has the hardest part . Her evolution makes sense . What about the ending ? Lilian Hellmann took the easy way out . But once again , it was 1961 . Mark Rydell , in 1968 , when the code had been revised , did not improve on the ending with his own "" the fox "" . Neither did Claude Chabrol with "" les biches "" . With his legendary depth of field , Wyler lightens what could have been a filmed stage protection . He places his characters in their space as a chess player ( see the last scenes between the two women and the doctor ; also the scenes with the old lady and the girls ) . Spoiler : Wyler refused to sweeten the final . Whereas today's cinema would have reunited Hepburn and Garner hugging and kissing with a full choir and orchestra behind , he opts for an open ending . as an user already noticed , everything is possible . . . William Wyler was never the academic director the French "" cahiers du cinema "" and the Godard clique used to spit at . He took more chances than they did . And it was not over . "" The collector "" , the follow-up , four years later , tackled the real sexual perversion ( The two heroines are normal for today's audience , and they were forty years ago as well ) and was definitely ahead of its time .

Text2: A Classy New Coming Out Film with Emphasis on the East LA Community Fresh young talent and a healthy dollop of enthusiasm serve as the springboard of this well written ( Carlos Portugal and Charo Toledo ) , well directed ( Carlos Portugal ) and well acted exuberant story of those once perceived tightly closet doors of the East Los Angeles Hispanic community . Not that this is the first film to engage the topic of being gay in East LA - QUINCEA√ëERA is another superb film on the subject - but it addresses so many other aspects of family and social life happening now that it deserves a wide audience . With a cast of newcomers coupled with some very fine veterans of the screen EAST SIDE STORY comes to life in a highly entertaining fashion . Closeted schooled chef Diego Campos ( a fine debut by Ren√© Alvarado ) works as a waiter in his grandmother Sara's ( elegant Irene DeBari ) little Mexican restaurant where grumpy homophobic chef Don Rogelio ( Luis Accinelli ) presides in the kitchen . Diego dreams of opening his own restaurant but family ties keep him grounded . Diego's campy Aunt Bianca ( Gladise Jimenez ) returns from Monaco on one of her many expensive sojourns to find a man and changes begin to happen . Diego's equally closeted boyfriend Pablo Morales ( David Ber√≥n ) has been refusing to settle down in a relationship with Diego , claiming that the union is a ' passing fancy ' . When Bianca enters , Pablo's attentions turn to the sexy lady and Diego is brokenhearted . Into this m√©lange enters a white gay couple who buy a ' flip ' house across the street , a signal to the neighborhood that gentrification is just around the corner . The couple - Wesley ( Steve Callahan ) and Jonathan ( Cory Schneider ) - meet the morose Diego and a match strikes between Diego and Wesley . Jonathan is assigned all the lines having to do with prejudice and is the one who wants out of the neighborhood as soon as their house is enhanced and their gay friends begin to visit . The white couple move apart and Wesley and Diego begin a courtship dance that is encouraged by Diego's family . How Diego handles his loss of Pablo to his Aunt Bianca and copes with the possibility of being open with Wesley forms the story line . It is all the hilarious and not so hilarious sidebars that share the space of the ' outing ' that make the film so personal and successful . Carlos Portugal is clearly a talent to watch , as are his attractive and talented cast members . EAST SIDE STORY is a fine companion piece to QUINCEA√ëERA and should enjoy the same degree of popularity for all the same reasons ! Grady Harp

701,"Text1: Soul Survivors Cassie ( Melissa Sagemiller , whose face is forced into the background of the movie poster behind the recognizable faces of Eliza Dushku , Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley , despite being the main star ) shares a forbidden kiss with an ex-boyfriend , Matt ( Bentley ) who still carries a torch for her as current beau Sean ( Affleck ) watches . Annabel ( . . the absolutely sexy Dushku ) was dancing in the goth club playing loud industrial rock music as Sean went after her as Matt pursued that "" innocent "" kiss with Cassie , whose head-over-heels for Sean . With Sean mum due to being appropriately angry with that kiss he witnessed , Cassie's eyes are on him when a car in front of her Bronco ( . . carrying "" thrashers "" who were inside the club ) skids leading to a head-on collision . Awakening to find Sean supposedly dead while the remaining party survived , Cassie attempts unsuccessfully to move on with school , but her whole world spirals out of control as people appear and disappear , those thrashers ( . . one with long hair and a facial scar , another wearing a mask ) often either follow her , chase her , even threatening her life , and visits from Sean begging her to return with him . Matt returns from Harvard to help guide her through the pain and misery of Sean's death , while attempting to win her adoration , meanwhile Annabel begins to carry on relations with the third thrasher in that car the night they wrecked , Raven ( Angela Featherstone ) . For about 70 minutes , we watch as Cassie attempts to convince Matt and Annabel that people are after her and that Sean is with her . But , we see that perhaps everything that happens to her may be fiction created by some sort of head trauma as a result of her crash , or maybe even some sort of near-death journey with a "" priest "" , Jude ( Luke Wilson , never more angelic ) trying to help her . About 70 minutes of this film is rather disorienting with constant nightmare scenarios , characters who behave normal one minute and oddly the next , blood making appearances often in bizarre ways ( . . from Cassie's nose , mainly ) , constant dangerous figures who appear and vanish , with Cassie constantly wondering what the hell is going on . I must admit that I found this rather frustrating , but I guess that's part of what director Stephen Carpenter is aiming for , creating a difficult experience where nothing is what it seems and questioning Cassie's mental state . I do feel Carpenter is certainly ambitious , trying to challenge the viewer , but I personally found this rather tedious . I think those who buy into the "" love conquers all "" concept at the heart of the film ( Cassie and Sean's love can go up against any odds , including death ) , will like this best . But , the film's freakish nature , constantly hurling one bizarre sequence involving Cassie and her remaining pals ( . . and those creepy folks after her ) after another , might turn many off . After a while , I gave up on it , but the ending does bring everything full circle , and Carpenter does shed light on various characters and things Cassie sees which don't make sense at first , so maybe it's a sleeper for horror fans looking for this sort of thing . Not really as violent or lurid as it could've been thanks to the teen-friendly PG-13 rating . Fans of Dushku might wish to check it out just to see her in tight little outfits and during certain scenes with the goth look . She's a babe , no doubt . Pretty blond Sagemiller spends most of the film conflicted , frightened , and miserable . Bentley is wooden and Affleck plays up the perfect , sensitive , gentlemanly dreamboat boyfriend every 18-25 year old girly could possibly hope for . I think the film echoes "" Carnival of Souls "" in some ways , with Cassie ( . . like the character is CoS ) actually trying to escape fate .

Frankly I felt as if I came in at the middle of this film , though I saw the whole thing - but I never actually did figure out the plot . The boys ' father ( C . Aubrey Smith ) has been dishonorably discharged from the army and telegraphs each son that he wants to meet them at the family manse . The discharge was unfair - he was set up - now , I'm guessing here but it had something to do with illegal arms . His sons want to help him , but moments later , he is murdered in his study and his papers stolen . Taking what info they have , they split up and travel to India , South America and Egypt to find the people their father mentioned who can help clear his name . Loretta Young , who plays Greene's madcap girlfriend , chases him shamelessly in a variety of outfits . I still can't decide if there was too little or too much fooling around by the brothers . For me the comic stuff never does come off , Niven being the exception . The acting , however , is good . Richard Greene might have been Tyrone Power's only rival at 20th Century Fox , except that he returned to England in 1940 to enter the service . This was his first film under contract to Fox . He was very handsome with a nice screen persona ; baby boomers may remember him as television's "" Robin Hood . "" Loretta Young is dazzlingly beautiful - I actually didn't find her annoying as she seemed to fit right into the frenetic energy of the film . Sanders and Niven turned in their usual fine performances . There's a nice turn by Lina Basquette , too , as a foreign woman with information . For those who don't know Lina , well , she was a silent screen star and half-sister of dancer Marge Champion . She was married to Sam Warner ; after his death , the Warners took her child from her and made sure she never worked again . She eventually went to the dogs - literally - by becoming a breeder and judge at the Westminster Dog Show . In a New Yorker Profile done in the 1990s , she claimed to have been propositioned by Hitler and said she had done work as a spy during World War II . She also declared Eric Braeden of "" The Young and the Restless "" her favorite actor and ended up meeting him . She appeared at Cinecom when she was in her late 80s , and the audience , used to seeing elderly actresses in wheelchairs , was shocked at the end of "" The Younger Generation , "" one of her early films , when she didn't walk - but ran onto the stage , looking incredible , to answer questions . For me , Lina's appearance as Ahnee is actually the high point of "" Four Men and a Prayer , "" featuring some very attractive people in a half-comedy / half-drama and a confusing plot . Thankfully , Ford didn't stick with this genre .


Text2: Jack Palance Needed Work Enjoyed this Italian Film , which had comedy , drama and plenty of gang-buster shootings and mob torture . Women seemed to get their clothes ripped off and also slapped in the face back and forth . There was some very clever old and young thieves who managed to rip off plenty of men and woman . Some of the police were former crooks and at times used this experience in their detective plans to catch the big mob fences , who did money laundering through out the country . Jack Palance of course played the king pin and was a bad guy who hid in an American Embassy . This is definitely a very low budget film , but great to see Jack Palance trying to make a few bucks .

Shot with dark shadows that make London's poorer sections look like Harry Lime's stomping ground this is a great film to look at . Had it been made ten years later it would have fit very nicely into the Film Noir catalog . I really like the look and feel of this film a great deal . The problem with the film is that there are long stretches where not much happens . The plot of a wrongly accused woman is something that Hitchcock would have turned into a tightly wound thriller . Here its a meandering mood piece with the audience waiting to see what happens when John Mills finds out the lady he is falling for is accused of killing his brother . There are some nice action pieces , but mostly its a good deal of talk and emoting . Its not a bad film , its just not a particularly exciting one . I'd wait to see if this turns up on cable .

705,"Text1: It just couldn't grab me . Normally I enjoy watching old movies from the ' 20's , even the more slower paced one's but this movie just didn't do it for me , although it also is of course far from the worst I have ever seen . The movie has a good enough story but it isn't exactly the most intriguing or tense stories to follow . Lots of sequences don't seem to have a relevant enough importance . It might have to do with the fact that the original length of the movie was over 6 hours long , which might had shown some of the relevance of certain sequences and characters but there is really no way I'm ever going to watch this longer version . The movie was already overlong as it was . The movie didn't had very much interesting drama in it and although the main character seemed intriguing , it just didn't worked out powerful enough in the movie . The movie also isn't as technically advanced as some of the other movies from the same time period , clearly directed by more talented and more experimental directors such as F . W . Murnau , Fritz Lang , Victor Sj√∂str√∂m and D . W . Griffith , among others . But this all of course doesn't mean that the movie is a bad one to watch . The story of a fake Russian aristocratic lady-killer in Monte Carlo trying to get money from rich ladies as on its own quite a good story and in a way for movie standards also ahead of its time . Many more movies like this one , in many different forms were made and are still being made , many years later now . In this particular case this is a movie I wouldn't mind seeing remade , perhaps also with some more humor in it and a more clear message . The movie also uses some quite good camera positions , on a positive note . Also the acting is good enough , though Miss DuPont seems heavily miscast as a pretty 21 year young girl . She is too old looking for her role and she also most certainly wasn't pretty enough to find the story very convincing . Same perhaps goes for Dale Fuller . Erich von Stroheim plays the real main part of the movie and he does this with lots of flair . He also wrote and directed the movie . Laurel & Hardy regular Mae Busch shows up in a serious role for a change and it was refreshing to see her like that for a change . Certainly a watchable movie but really no essential viewing in my opinion .


Text2: 5 Dolls for an August Moon A wealthy industrialist , George Stark ( Teodoro Corr√† ) , invites various couplings to his palatial island beach house with the goal of needling a "" scientist "" , Prof . Farrell ( William Berger ) into selling a formula that could lead to millions . Several of the men who show up to George's shindig are business acquaintances also desiring to purchase the formula . One by one , the visitors ( the wives who came along as well as their husbands ) fall to a quiet killer using various methods while others ' backs are turned . Playing off the oft-used "" Ten Little Indians "" concept , someone ( . . or more than one ? ) amongst the group is bumping the others off . For macabre humor , director Bava has George store each fallen victim in his freezer wrapped in plastic followed by some music to commemorate being among the death-list . Before long , they are dropping like flies until a mere three or four are squabbling over who is sneaky and slick enough to pull off the killings without being noticed . That is what Bava toys the viewer with setting up a possible killer , and then subsequently upping the ante by pulling the rug from under us a good three times at the end . For a film Bava was forced into making , the twists that come at the end are quite inspired . I especially enjoyed his pokes at the wealthy . . it's kind of a satire on just how greedy , vile , and back-stabbing the upper-class yuppie types can be . The desire for more and more wealth is played to it's zenith at the end . It seems that Bava doesn't give us anyone to care about , providing us with a list of unlikable , selfish cretins to root against . We are perhaps given a character with humanity in the scientist , but , as the film continues , even he is corrupt and exposed . Not violent at all for a psycho thriller / mystery . It features an attractive cast with a bevy of beauties wearing skimpy outfits . I think it comes off better because Bava seems to have contempt for these people which might explain why the scenes in the freezer seem much more absurdly amusing than a normal reaction might extract from the viewer . It's typically stylish , but Bava surprisingly holds back ( . . this might be considered a weakness from Bava's avid fanbase who like it when Bava lets loose a visual frenzy often making up for the story's lack of bite ) allowing the mystery to take center stage .

Given that Sergio Leone was partially responsible for this film ( though he did not direct it , I found out later ) , I grabbed the tape and was excited . After all , his Westerns from the 60s were among the best of the genre ever made . However , despite this past track record , this film was a major disappointment to me because it seems the writers tried to combine many of the typical Leone elements with a comedy ! ! ? ? Huh ? ! I do NOT watch a "" Spaghetti Western "" for its comedy ( though there may be a few funny moments , they are not meant as comedy ) . And , to let the audience know it's all supposed to be funny , Ennio Merricone's score ( usually the highlight of any Western ) sounds like it belongs to a 1960s or 70s Disney movie much of the time ! Now , if I had no idea who Leone was and if I had never even seen an Italian Western , I still think I would not have particularly liked this movie all that much . That's because the two central characters are just so different - - Fonda as the cold gunfighter and Hill as a crazy , lovable jerk that could probably out-shoot anyone .

Here , Jerry sees an advertisement for a cartoon dog and answers it , riding a swaybacked horse to the office , where he is promptly awarded a contract . The series , although nothing special by modern or even current standards - - it opens with a pen and a bottle of ink drawing Jerry , reminiscent of Fleischer's "" Out of the Inkwell "" series - - was apparently good enough for Pathe to produce over forty of them . They very occasionally show up at New York's Museum of Modern Art , or , if you wish , you can go to British Pathe's website and take a look at them for yourself .


Text2: Utterly predictable but there are some good laughs Coupe Brad ( Vince Vaughn ) and Kate ( Reese Witherspoon ) have been dating for three years but have no interest in getting married or having babies .

However they're caught on camera one Christmas and have to promise to visit all their 4 families that one day . Naturally all their families are somewhat strange and familiar ( but funny ) complications ensure . I saw this for a few reasons - - it got good reviews from critics ; it's been an OK hit ( so far ) ; I like Vaughn and Witherspoon and it's hard to resist a movie with FOUR Academy Award winning actors in supporting roles - - Robert Duvall , Sissy Spacek , Mary Steenburgen and Jon Voight . It's not a great movie at all but it had a few good laughs and - - at 88 minutes - - it doesn't wear out its welcome . Supposedly Vaughn and Witherspoon didn't get along at all while working on this but you'd never know it from the film . They have some great chemistry and their comedic timing is right on target . The rest of the cast is as good as anyone could be and they all act well enough to make the entirely predictable story go down smoothly . It's not perfect . I could have lived without the TWO instances of projectile vomiting and Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw were too vicious and unfunny as Vaughn's brothers . Some people find seeing other people beaten up hysterically funny but I'm not one of them . Still these are small parts of the movie . All in all a good enjoyable holiday film .

Text2: "" It has been established that persons who have recently died have been returning to life and committing acts of murder . "" As a horror fan , I'm often asked my opinion on what the scariest movie of all time is . I always give the same answer ? Night of the Living Dead . There is no movie that fills me with more of a sense of unease , literally has the hair on the back of my neck standing on end , and causes me to actually look in the dark corners of a room like George Romero's masterpiece . Fear is so subjective that I am fully aware that what frightens me might not automatically frighten you . But in the case of Night of the Living Dead , I have trouble understanding how anyone isn't affected the same way I am . It's that powerful to me . I'm not the biggest Romero fan in the world , but I am of Night of the Living Dead . What he was able to accomplish with an obviously limited budget is nothing short of amazing . Romero created more atmosphere in the opening ten minutes of Night of the Living Dead than most directors with unlimited budgets ever could . Some of the acting may not be the best you'll run across , but for me that only adds to the film's authentic feel . They seem like real people trapped in that house . The special effects may not be as realistic as those in other zombie movies , but I've never seen what someone eating a kidney really looks like . It works very well with me . Finally , the ending is as bleak and powerful as any horror movie I've seen . Most directors would have been tempted ( or forced ) to give it a happy ending . Thankfully , Romero isn't most directors . In short , Night of the Living Dead is the stuff of real nightmares .

Text2: Donny and the bunny man Donnie Darko is a brainy but depressed teenager . Between a familial cocoon on the verge of splitting up and a conformist high school , he's suffocating . His only real friend is a giant rabbit named Frank . The latter orders him to commit acts of violence and predicts him the end of the world in 28 days , 06 hours , 42 minutes and 12 seconds . . . . . . And this is what grabbed my attention about the American independent movie made by a 26 year old young director , Richard Kelly . I was amazed at the general enthusiasm on this site around this flick while knowing it opened around the world with little hype ( in France , it had a very quiet opening ) . "" Donnie Darko "" could occupy a prominent place among the movies which were sleepers at the time of their release but which gained the status of cult-movie . I have heard about it thanks to one of my favorite bands : Echo and the Bunnymen . Their grand song "" the Killing Moon "" opens a movie which in its first quarter of an hour presents a series of sequences drastically different in the content and form ( from the moment when Donnie awakes in the country to the presentation of his high school to the first apparition of Frank , the rabbit ) . The first merit we can attribute to Kelly's flick is having gathered several cinema genres in a sole genuine story ( fantastic , comedy , drama , thriller , teenage movie ) . This variety is equaled by the liberty of tones that characterizes the movie . Going from fantasizing to realism , swinging from fantastic to comedy as if it followed naturally , Kelly also excels in imposing climates . The more the movies goes on , the more intensity it accumulates . An intensity that Kelly controls without extreme special effects and by little touches , notably with the apparitions of the evil rabbit which pepper the work . This creature is a kind of witness of Donnie's troubled mind . As a matter of fact , the movie wavers nearly all the time between 2 poles : the exterior world and Donnie's inner psycho . We penetrate in the tormented mind of a teenager who is prey to a profound discontentment and especially rebelled against the world that surrounds him . By committing odd and alarming acts suggested by Frank , he expresses his contempt and his hate for this shameful world . So , in a way Frank is the intermediary point between Donnie's mind and his exterior contact . But these acts are for Kelly an excellent means to break the deceitful appearances and to remove masks of hateful characters . To a second degree , "" Donnie Darko "" is adorned with a scathing social critic whose target is especially the education system . This one is ossified , remains paralyzed in its conformist educational methods . One of its goals is turning young female pupils in pompom girls ! And in one memorable sequence , the headmaster rejects Drew Barrymore's educational methods without explaining why ! The critic is still more acid when the teachers welcomes nearly with open arms a persuasive preacher ( an unexpected Patrick Swayze ) who claims knowing how to crush fear thanks to a total master of positive energy . Ultimately , it is total idolatry or credulity for shameless charlatanism that the movie also attacks and when we learn Swayze's hidden secret , the satire is extra intense . Furthermore , Kelly also skilfully incorporated elements of teenage movie in his rich work and these elements are generally the ones which are put aside in teenage movies . The most important one is the difficulties of communication between teenagers and their parents . Donnie suffers but his parents ( even his girlfriend or close relatives ) are incapable of understanding him , although they seem to agree their son on certain points like the education in his school . Even his analysis sessions are of little help for him . What can he do ? Perhaps contemplating the possibility of time travel . . . As for the cast , it alternates good and , let's say , less good surprises . The best : Jake Gyllenhaal is a real revelation , both frail and disturbing . The actress who acts his gym teacher also stands out even if she acts a grotesque character . But thanks to this , the movie is blessed with comic moments of a high quality .

712,"Text1: Beloved Enemy-Woe to Wonderful Foe Film loosely based on Irish revolutionary Michael Collins . They added romance to this 1936 picture , and even though it has been fictionalized , it's still a very good picture . The chemistry between revolutionary Brian Aherne and Merle Oberon , the daughter of a British diplomat is just fine here .

There are some fine supporting performances here , especially by Henry Stephenson , as the diplomat , David Niven as an attach√© and another gem role for Donald Crisp , as a militant revolutionary .

Text2: A Nightmare on Elm Street "" Whatever you do , don't fall asleep . "" A Word of Warning : This user comment is for those who have seen the film . You know , I often take away the memorable frightening images when watching this film , but this particular viewing had me focusing on something else . . the ending . If you think about it , the entire film until that baffling final scene is one long nightmare . I was trying to wrap my head around it , because it seems we often overlook this very story arc . I always just told myself , that these four teenagers were being stalked by a nightmare slayer , whose perhaps targeting the children of those who burned him alive . But , it's all ( supposedly ) a scary concoction in the realm of Nancy's ( Heather Langenkamp ) sleep . I'm not sure if I just woke up from being under a rock or what , but it was something that startled me . Then the ending comes ( . . from what I understand , this confusing conclusion was set up by Craven as a favor to producer Shaye who was hoping to benefit from a sequel , and boy was rewarded ! ) and I was once again , as I always am , left with my jaw swinging open . I'll never truly make sense of that final scene , but Craven leaves enough lasting nightmarish images to take away that I'm completely satisfied each time I watch it . The shocking murder of Tina , sliced across the stomach , blood all over the place , dragged up the wall and across the ceiling . Then later , Tina in a body bag ( yikes ! ) calling Nancy's name , later seeing her body , in bag , being drug across the school hallway leaving a blood trail . The invisible hanging of Tina's thuggish beau Rod ( Nick Corri ) in his jail cell , locked up as the one responsible for what Fred Kreuger did to her . The monumental death scene of Johnny Depp's Glen , pulled into a void in his bed ( . . television in tow ) with a gushing water fall of blood erupting like a geyser throughout the ceiling and room . The imaginative occurrences which terrorize Nancy ( . . the telephone-tongue gag , the quicksand steps , the bladed glove slowly creeping from between her legs as she lies in her bath tub nearly asleep ) . Maybe Craven's overall product has flaws which seep through , but he provides so much to make your skin crawl . What playful ground Craven has to operate his ghoulish tricks . . the nightmare world provides such freedom to kill innocent teens anyway you wish , as they run for their very lives with nowhere , it seems , to escape . A "" filthy child murderer "" who would brings kids to a boiler room to kill . . certainly not the hero many would cheer down the road . Interesting , isn't it , that we often forget the evil fiend he really is . Craven gives this psycho free reign to torment and terrorize , the idea is certainly scary if you think about it . And , as far as Nancy , I was doting on the idea that this film is almost entirely ( . . if not entirely , depending on your opinion with that crazy finale ) inside her nightmare , regarding her parents . Interesting that her mom is an oddball drunk and her dad is always gone . They rarely have anything nice to say to each other , and one can sense that this is in the nightmare for Nancy to deal with . . a daughter bothered by the separation of her parents and how her mother deals with it through downing alcohol . And , it's always nice to see Freddy before he was the jokey psycho-clown . You rarely ever get a full glimpse of his face , he's the epitome of a prowler in the shadows who is always near yet hard to find . . until it's too late , and you are caught in his grip . While I think the Shoulder's "" Freddy's Revenge "" has the scariest incarnation of Freddy , he's certainly given moments in Craven's film . . such as that one scene where his arms stretch wide as he comes towards Tina , or when he "" stretches "" through a wall spying on Nancy .

714,"Text1: Not as horrible as you might think ! ! While I am sure my summary is not exactly a glowing endorsement , I do think that this bad movie isn't nearly rotten enough to merit its current listing among the "" hallowed 100 "" - - the 100 lowest ranked films listed on IMDb . Instead of being a 100 % "" stinker "" , it's actually a low-budget but watchable film . . . . really ! When the film begins , you are greeted with a house that is obviously a painting - - from which the film's odd title emanates . Odd , because there is nothing "" unearthly "" about the film - - no aliens at all . The first scene you are greeted to is a closeup of Tor Johnson killing someone . Seeing Tor , I knew this film would be low-budget crap - - heck , he's the unofficial king of these films with his luminous performances in such dreck classics as BRIDE OF THE MONSTER , PLAN 9 and THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS ( my vote for the worst of his films ) . Interestingly , in this film he's named ' Lobo ' - - the same name he had in NIGHT OF THE GHOULS and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER . He's back again in THE UNEARTHLY as essentially the same guy ( though he does talk some in this film , unlike the others ) . You must assume , then , that he's a freelance henchman - - willing to work not for Bela Lugosi , Kenne Duncan and here for John Carradine . I could imagine his classified ad now : "" Loyal , brutish henchman looking for a position . Ability to speak limited but hulking appearance more than makes up for shortcomings . "" It turns out that Tor is working in a weird clinic in the middle of nowhere for the evil doctor ( Carradine ) and his devoted assistant , Dr . Gilchrist ( Marilyn Buferd ) . Despite Gilchrist being a bit of a 50s horror movie babe , however , Carradine seems rather immune to her advances and focuses his energies on creating and implanting a supposed "" new gland "" in his patients . Sadly , however , the gland only seems to have the side effect of turning the patients into creepy and disfigured ghouls or werewolf-like creatures . Sadly , the victims have no idea that they'll be subjected to these sick experiments and so they just wait until it's there turn . Of course , considering the clinic is in the middle of no where and the patients are not allowed outside , you'd think they might suspect SOMETHING ! Into this lovely menagerie comes a wanted murderer ( played by Myron Healey ) . Healey was a very competent and familiar supporting actor from television and so you wonder why with almost 300 performances to his credit he would have appeared in this film . His character is supposed to be a killer , but it's obvious he's more than meets the eye , as he quickly determines the doctor's true intentions as well as organizes the other patients into an escape team . When this fails , a little surprise takes place and the evil scheme unravels . Okay , so much of the plot sounds a bit familiar . Carradine has played mad scientists in at least 19 , 390 other cheap movies . Tor has the acting range of a sprig of spinach . Sure , the creatures look amazingly cheesy . Still , despite all this , the film is watchable and campy fun . While far from good , for lovers of bad movies , it's well worth seeing and not nearly as unwatchable as its current rating might imply .

716,"Text1: Fascinating , but can't explain why . . . "" Figures in a Landscape "" is definitely one of the weirdest and most unclassifiable movies I've encountered lately , and at the same time it's pretty difficult to explain why that is . Some movies are weird because they increasingly overpower the viewer with substantial twists and / or stylistic gimmicks , but still they constantly uphold the impression there's some kind of deeper meaning or hidden structure behind it . The films of David Lynch are like that , for example . Other movies , and "" Figures in a Landscape "" is definitely one of them , are weird because they never at one point feature abrupt story twists and never even seem to want to achieve a deeper meaning . Kind of like the ' what you see is what you get principle ' and don't even bother asking background information . Based on Barry England's novel - that probably only very few people have read - "" Figures in a Landscape "" revolves on two escaped convicts nervously running across a desolate area . Pretty much like the title implies , they are , in fact , simply figures in a landscape . We're never explained where exactly the events take place ( South America ? East Asia ? ) or what crimes the two committed in the first place . They must have been quite serious , however , as MacConnachie and Ansell quickly find themselves besieged by a menacing black helicopter and later also by army patrols on foot . The helicopter plays a devastating mental and physical game with them , as it appears to be omnipresent and in absolutely no hurry to pick them up . This is the type of film where there are no characters to root for . You won't develop any sympathy for the fugitives as they commit some truly vile acts along their way and you can't really support the guys inside the helicopter , neither , as their faces aren't even properly shown . "" Figures in a Landscape "" is a brooding , moody and mildly unsettling film that doesn't always makes sense and doesn't bother to involve the viewer . But , if you manage to put all the unanswered questions aside from you , this also might turn out one extremely enchanting viewing experience . Every shot , every inch of the landscape seems precisely measured and re-considered at least a dozen times before featuring in the film . The choreography is simply wonderful and the filming locations ? apparently Spanish ? are almost continuously breathtaking . The performances of Robert Shaw and Malcolm McDowell couldn't be more apt and Joseph Losey's direction is very surefooted . After seeing only this and the even more unique "" These are the Doomed "" , I'm more than anxious to check out Losey's further repertoire .


Text2: I Wasn't Impressed THE UNTOUCHABLES came out in an explosion of acclaim in 1987 with the critics hailing it as "" a masterpiece "" and "" An instant classic "" but after seeing the movie I was wondering if I'd been watching the same movie . My own theory as to why so many cynical movie critics liked it might have had something to do with the very poor standard of movies in the mid to late 80s which seemed to involve either teenagers getting killed in a variety of gruesome ways or a couple of well dressed cops pointing their guns while the billboard hot one hundred plays in the background . Off the top of my head I can think of only one movie from the same period that deserved much praise and that was PLATOON It could also be remembered that THE UNTOUCHABLES has a great cast list with DeNiro , Connery and a couple of rising stars in Kevin Costner and Andy Garcia , but the screenplay fails to focus on any one character . You do get the impression that it has been re-written to death in order to accommodate the big name stars . Personally I thought Capone should have been the main protagonist with Ness in the background with tough wily Irish cop Malone absent altogether . Maybe that was the intention with the original script but it had been changed with the casting coup involved ? Sticking one or two factual elements into the story would have helped too The more De Palma movies I see the more repetitive his directing techniques become . Long panning shots , slow motion sequences featuring bloody deaths . It was good in CARRIE but had become old hat hereOh and if it was such a great 1987 release how come it didn't get a massive load of Oscar nominations ?

McDowell plays Michael Travis , a young man who works for a coffee company and due to circumstances ( of the extreme kind ) ends up working for an extremely rich man and then ends up in prison , only to find himself penniless and on the street in London . There are all sorts of interesting adventures that he wanders through on the way , and it's all done in sort of a deadpan humor , with occasional musical breaks by Alan Price and his band . Fans of British TV & film will find several familiar faces here . McDowell moves through his adventures with a sort of calm naivety , no matter what happens , and he is often taken advantage of , but still manages to keep his good attitude . This may not be for everyone since the humor is rather dry at times , but it's a good satirical look at society and morals and a very interesting movie . .

Now he's out to strike back at those he blames for his situation , while forming a tender friendship with a blind girl , Helen Paige ( the wonderfully beautiful Jane Adams ) , who is therefore not bound by any fear of his appearance . Were it not for Hattons ' presence ( sadly , this was his last picture ) , this would still be watchable but pretty forgettable . The plot is pretty standard . Supporting performances are acceptable , and the music has a familiar ring to it . There are also points , such as the gin rummy sequence , where the picture ought not to be taken too seriously . It's well paced ( running just under an hour long ) and reasonably entertaining , but Hattons ' poignant presence makes it something different . This is no one-dimensionally evil boogeyman , but a man blinded by the same temper that afflicted him in better days . One can get the sense of the kind and sensitive person that Hatton was . While it may have been unfortunate that the movie business was too quick to exploit Hattons ' appearance , there's no doubt that he made his mark in cinema . People continue to remember him today , right down to the naming of an award - marking achievement in horror research - after him . Rest in peace , Rondo Hatton .


Text2: The sound of one hand strangling . . . Very interesting and pretty effective psychological horror stars the always wonderful Michael Caine as the creator of a fantasy-based comic strip who is having some pretty strained relations with wife Anne ( Andrea Marcovicci ) . Well , his life takes a horrific turn when , in a bizarre traffic accident , his drawing hand is severed . As Jon Lansdale ( Caine ) goes to live in solitude with a new gig as a college professor in California , the missing hand seems to have taken on a "" life "" of its own , murdering everybody who makes Jon angry . I severely under-rated this one upon first viewing a few years back . I now realize what the intent here was , and the film works quite well , drawing us into the increasingly unstable and paranoid mind of Jon . Caine does a highly creditable job in this role . It's a dark and moody tale , well realized by future Oscar-winning film-maker Oliver Stone , in this early directorial effort . Stone also gets good performances out of the supporting cast , which also includes adorable young Mara Hobel - the young Christina Crawford in the same years ' "" Mommie Dearest "" , Rosemary Murphy , Annie McEnroe , Bruce McGill , Charles Fleischer , Pat Corley , and Tracey Walter . Carlo Rambaldi supplies the many different hand effects , James Horner contributes a solid score from the early years of his career , and King Baggot is the excellent cinematographer . Stone has a very good crew to work with here . In contrast to the psychological aspects of the story , Stone doesn't shy away from the red stuff when it's time . The severing of the hand is a good and gruesome set piece . For the most part , though , it's a subtle piece of work . Although the final scene doesn't seem all that necessary , the picture does end on a memorable final note . The final freeze frame of Caines ' face just says it all . Overall , it's an under-rated shocker worth looking into for the curious .

Sure it's no "" Lethal Weapon "" but it sure is a good action comedy that entertains well . The movie doesn't really have much story and even the little story elements that are present in the movie are far from interesting . It's weak and simple but yet the movie is made interesting and carried by Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn , who have a surprising good chemistry and the many action sequences present in the movie , that are not the best you've ever seen but entertaining nevertheless . The movie serves its purpose well . The comedy elements in the movie work out well enough to make this an entertaining movie to watch . The characters aren't the best ever and are all quite formulaic but it's sort of fitting for a movie like this . Mel Gibson does a good job in this movie . Basically he in this movie plays a bit of the same way as he plays his Riggs character in the Lethal Weapon movies . No wonder , Gibson made this movie just after "" Lethal Weapon 2 "" and he clearly was in the mood for more . The result of that can be seen in this movie . He provides the movie certainly with a certain extra and gives the movie some extra fun . On top of that he and Goldie Hawn work pretty well as a screen duo , which does provide the movie with some of its best moments . Goldie Hawn herself is also surprising good in this movie and she shows that she can handle the genre . The villains are definitely a disappointing aspect about this movie . I mean when the main villains are being played by David Carradine and Bill Duke you would expect something more of it . The villains play a very little part in the movie and in it they get very little interesting to do . A waste of two fine actors . Some goes for the rest of the supporting cast . The movie is from 1990 but it still has an ' 80's feeling over it . Meaning lots of formulaic car chases , shootouts , haircuts and two main , ' buddy team ' , characters . Plus some horrible ' 80's music . I mostly hate Hans Zimmer score from the early ' 90's . They sound like ' 80's left overs . The movie is nothing too spectacular but it does has some great moments . Also the finale does not disappoint . The movie is professionally directed by John Badham , who never really made great movies but more movies that served their purpose always well . Nothing too great but the movie deserves a better reputation , since this is some great entertaining fun , to watch .


Text2: The Brilliance of Wendy Wasserstein ! I miss Wendy Wasserstein , the playwright , who wrote feminist related plays . This play is probably my favorite starring Meryl Streep , Swoosie Kurtz , Jill Eikenberry , Ann McDonough , and Ellen Parker long before they were famous . Streep just won an Oscar . In this taped version of the stage play , the women of Mount Holyoke College talk about college life . I loved the interaction among the women . I wished that Wendy had lived because she really was the voice of women in this generation . This is not Sex and the City and thank God . These women are strong , intelligent , and independent . Almost 30 years later , Meryl Streep is one of America's greatest film actresses , Jill Eikenberry struck big with L . A . Law , Swoosie Kurtz is still on Broadway but also known for her appearances on television and film , and Ellen Parker won an Emmy for her role on Guiding Light . The story about these women characters reflected the women who played them .

721,"Text1: Better reading the book . The conclusion was taken from Christie's adaptation of her novel for the stage . Hence the big difference ! The biggest flaw of this passable suspense story lies in the characters : some of them have been downright ruled out : such is the case of Miss Brent , the old narrow-minded spinster ; she's turned into a sophisticated actress ! Anthony Marston the playboy becomes a singer played by a third-rate singer , Fabian . As for the others , they are much less interesting than on the paper : Ann Clyde ( = Vera Claythorne ) played by Goldfinger gorgeous golden girl Shirley Eaton , has not the guilt feeling she had in Christie's words . Hugh O ' Brian's Lombard ( Hugh instead of Philip , we wonder why ) has a love affair with her , probably to sweeten Christie's ruthless plot . Stanley Holloway's Blore and Wilfrid Hyde-White's mischievous judge easily steal the show . They had teamed up the year before in Cukor's "" My fair lady "" . The location in the mountains was not a bad idea and could successfullyreplace the famous island . At least , one scene is impressive : the domestic's escape on the cable-car . Unfortunately George Pollock ( Miss Marple series of the sixties ) is too academic a director to generate genuine thrills . Besides , 99 % of the people who watched , are watching or will watch this movie have already read the book , probably the best known detective story in the universe . So why complain if you're not surprised ? The version I saw did include the whodunit minute but I read it had been deleted since .


Text2: North by Northwest I had no idea what was going on the first time I saw this "" classic masterpiece "" from the great Sir Alfred Hitchcock , but paying much closer attention the second time I can see why it is given that title . Basically Roger O . Thornhill ( Cary Grant ) has ended a normal day of work , and suddenly he is abducted at gunpoint by two henchmen mistaking him for a government agent named George Kaplan . After meeting their boss ( unknown for the moment ) , he is intoxicated and put driving in a car . He manages to escape charges , as long as he can prove his innocence , so he is now following all leads and clues that can lead either back to the abductors , or this "" Kaplan "" . Many crimes happen around him , and he is photographed as being the key suspect , but he manages to find a friendly girl , Eve Kendall ( Eva Marie Saint ) on a train , who is instantly attracted to him and says she will help him with his search for answers . At one point Kaplan passes a message to meet Roger on an almost remote road with some crop fields , and this sees one of the most memorable scenes , with him being attacked by the crop dusting plane . After escaping this , he heads to the hotel where he believes Kaplan is staying , and there he finds Eve again , and this is when he starts suspecting she is part of the act . He is right , there is a point that the villains he met before are with her . But he eventually meets The Professor ( Leo G . Carroll ) who reveals she is working for the government agency trying to find out information about them stealing microfilm secrets , oh , and also that Kaplan is fictional , it's Eve . The conclusion of the film sees Roger going to the house where the villain , Phillip Vandamm ( James Mason ) , and his henchman Leonard ( Martin Landau ) are staying , near the Mount Rushmore monument , and this sees the second most memorable scene , climbing all over the four presidents ( LOL ) . In the end the villains fall to their deaths , the microfilm is recovered , and Roger and Eve are newlyweds . Also starring Jessie Royce Landis as Clara Thornhill , and Hitchcock's cameo is the man missing a bus . Grant is fantastically charming , the direction is impeccable , and it is just a film you can't miss . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Film Editing and Best Writing , Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen . Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , he was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors , he was number 2 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , and he was number 23 on The World's Greatest Actor , the film was number 4 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , it was number 40 on 100 Years , 100 Movies , and it was number 7 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die .

722,"Text1: Ahhh , MUCH better ! ! Blade II is an exciting action film that takes the tired vampire story and adds a new twist by introducing an entirely new villain . Sure , there is sure to be some controversy ( at least among film fans and fans of the genre ) about whether or not it is right to introduce new characters in this way . Vampires are a tired theme at the movies , but it is a time-honored genre in itself that deserves respect just from the fact that it has been around for so long in literature before the movies . The question of whether or not the writers were justified in introducing these new characters is , in my opinion , satisfied by the fact that they made such quality villains that fit so well into the genre . I am thrilled to see that they didn't just make another dumb Blade film that was exactly the same as the original except for the possibility of some new special effects , because these new characters , called Reapers , are exactly what the film series , as well as , potentially , the genre as a whole , needed . Reapers are blood-feeders , just like vampires , except they feed on humans as well as vampires , effectively making them an enemy of both , and their thirst is much stronger than the traditional vampire . And to make matters worse ( or better , depending on whether you are an enemy of the Reapers of a member of the audience ) , they are identified by a scar which runs down their chin . This scar is where the lower jaw splits open when the Reaper is feeding , creating a frighteningly massive mouth like a vampire version of the Predator , and which has things inside it reminiscent of the horrifying and strangely unique Tremors . There are some amazing make-up effects here as well , although I can see the film being automatically overlooked at the Oscars in 2003 simply because it is the successor of such a low class action / horror film , as well as because this is just not the kind of movie that wins Academy Awards . I'm not sure that there is anything in this film that is likely to catch the Academy's attention , but the make-up was very impressive to say the least . Wesley Snipes returns to the role of Blade , the half-human / half-vampire creature dubbed the ' Daywalker ' because of his ability to withstand sunlight . This is in itself one of the better parts of the movie , because even though I was enormously unimpressed with the original film , there is no one that could play this character as well as Snipes does . There is also an interesting conflict introduced as Blade is forced to team up with the vampires , his mortal enemies who we are to assume could turn on him at any time , in order to fight the Reapers ( by far the more dangerous enemy ) , who ? reproduce , ' you might say , at an astonishing rate . It's too bad , though , that the existence of the Reapers was introduced by vampires in a rather impressive although entirely unnecessary fight scene between a couple of vampires and Blade himself . Blade is attacked one night by two vampires wearing body suits ( and some goggles that probably retain the coolest effect of the entire film ) , they fight violently for several minutes at full speed without rest , until one of them suddenly kneels before Blade and asks for a truce , informing him that there is now something on the streets that is even worse than him . If they were going to ask for a truce , you would think that they would approach him at least a little differently . One of these vampires ( the better fighter , as it were ) turns out to be Nyssa Damaskinos , a sexy brunette vampire who's lipstick was not smeared in the least even by all of those flying kicks that she took to the face from Blade about 15 feet in the air . Remarkable . There seems to be a growing trend of having honest fight scenes replaced at an ever-increasing amount by special effects . Consider how vastly the role of special effects increased in Jet Li's fight scenes in Lethal Weapon 4 ( relatively few special effects ) , Romeo Must Die ( massive amounts of special effects ) , and The One ( relatively few movements that were NOT special effects ) . This same trend is

Text2: The other kind of terrorism ? In a time when the world is so focused on the conflict unfolding in Iraq , the thing that is most clear to me after watching this movie is the old saying that after thousands of years of wars fought in the name of religion , we are not a second closer to peace than we ever were . Osama looks at one of the many religious struggles in the world by focusing on the plight of women under the iron fist of the Taliban , one of the sickest and most debase groups on earth . The story focuses on a young girl living in an all female family , and since they live in an area ruled by the Taliban , they are not allowed to leave the house , because women walking around unaccompanied by a male are promptly arrested and subjected to inhuman punishments . With no way to feed themselves , since women are not even allowed to leave the house , much less work , their only choice is to dress up their youngest member of the family as a boy and have her go out and find work to feed everyone else . The most important thing that the film does is that it calls attention to the atrocities that are being committed by religious groups beyond hijacking planes or planting roadside bombs or kidnapping and beheading people . In addition to all of those horrible atrocities , there are women in Afghanistan that are literally treated not just like property , but like animals . At one point in the movie , one character , a woman , wishes that God had never created women . The fact that she wishes that God had never created women , rather than wishing something a little more logical , like that God had never created the Taliban , serves to bring into sharp focus the extent to which the Taliban have perverted these women's minds . The film opens with a surreal scene of a large group of women in ghostly blue burkhas in a demonstration in which they chant their desire for the right to work , for some reason seeming to have forgotten that they do not even have the right to assemble . The local Taliban , however , remembers this little detail very clearly , and starts by hosing the women down with high-pressure hoses before opening fire on them . That such madness is committed in the name of some god is an illustration of how humans can take the concept of religion and twist it so horribly wrong that they can justify doing whatever on earth they feel like . The movie is a study not only of the atrocious practices that are carried out against women by the Taliban , but also an illustration of the elasticity of the concept of religion . Especially in America , we have this conception of religion as this benevolent force that transcends the suffering that we endure on earth and promises justification through a higher medium . Osama shows us that it is the very concept of religion that is used in some practices to justify that suffering for which we look above for reasoning and comfort . The Taliban have succeeded in amassing all of the worst possible appropriations associated with religion , turning it from a benevolent force and into a tool with which to justify their massive destruction of human rights , which are not an American concept but a religious one . Aristotle once said , ' I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God that has endowed us with sense , reason , and intellect has intended us to forego their use . ' Similarly , I personally do not feel obliged to believe that any God in existence , presiding over any religious sect , could possibly approve of the wholesale torture , abuse , and destruction of women , a divine creation if there is a single one on earth .

723,"Text1: Outstandingly slow ! I should clarify . In what is known as the first prison break film ever made , I was initially surprised at how similar Grand Illusion was to the 1963 film The Great Escape , which is to be expected , of course , since this film probably had such a profound impact on that one ( and any respectable break-out movie that has ever come out , as it were ) . I was also surprised to see that , not only does the movie move at an alarmingly slow pace during much of the middle of it , but several of the characters come across as almost stereotypical caricatures , like they are filling in expected roles in a formula film . But then ( and here is where it really struck me how great this movie is ) , before I even realized anything was changing in my mind , it occurred to me that the combination of the slow pace and the caricatures were almost like a cinematic justification of the pace of the film and the characters that appeared in it . After more and more seemingly slow or even irrelevant scenes , you suddenly see these caricatures not only as characters rather than caricatures , but as people rather than characters . At least as important is Director Jean Renoir's desire to present it not as a movie about relationships between people of different nationalities ( an understandable conclusion , since it takes place in a time of war ) , but of HUMAN relationships , of common bonds of humanity rather than nationality . He explains this in a wonderful video introduction to the film , in which he also talks about the film's nearly miraculous survival after years of having been lost . If you get a chance to catch it on DVD , you will be watching a copy that was thought to have been destroyed by the Nazis decades ago !


Text2: The merry-go-round broke down . During Hollywood's golden era , several of the major studios tried to offer a splashy musical comedy that went through annual editions . MGM had ' Broadway Melody of ( insert year ) ' . Paramount had ' The Big Broadcast of ( insert year ) ' . Warners had ' Gold Diggers of ( insert year ) ' . Typically , the date in the title was the year AFTER the film was released , so that the movie could remain in distribution for an entire year and still seem up-to-date . ' Merry-Go-Round of 1938 ' looks and sounds suspiciously like Universal Studios ' attempt to get in on this franchise . . . except that there was no sequel for 1939 nor any subsequent year . The most notable thing about this movie is its two top-billed actors . Bert Lahr plays a rare starring role here , as a vaudevillain clearly based on himself . Second-billed is Jimmy Savo , a wistful little comedian ( subclass Norman Wisdom ) who was briefly a star on Broadway but made very few films . This is probably Savo's best screen performance , yet the director seems to be deliberately cheating him . Savo had a pleasant singing voice : here , when he warbles a lullaby to an orphaned baby , his face is turned away from the camera to create the ( false ) impression that Savo's singing voice is dubbed . In a later sequence , Savo does a spirited eccentric dance . . . but the camera is so far away from him that the effect is diluted . Get this plot , now . Lahr , Savo , Mischa Auer and Billy House are the Grand Street Comedy Four , a vaude act who ( in 1918 ) play the same bill as aerialist Dainty Doris . Conveniently , Doris has just fallen off her trapeze : she survives just long enough to make the four comedians promise to raise her baby daughter Sally . A few years later , the Comedy Four have got themselves booked in the Palace . . . but , before they can play the date , their big break is lost when little Sally gives them all the mumps . Fade to 1938 , and some half-hearted attempts to make the four lead actors look older with makeup . 20-year-old Sally is now a vivacious young vocalist , who has got herself engaged to handsome society scion Tony Townsend . This is one of those annoying films in which there aren't any real problems , so the scriptwriter has got to throw phony obstacles in the characters ' paths . Tony and Sally want to get married , but she hasn't the heart to leave her four ' fathers ' , who are skint and will presumably starve without her . Fair enough , except that wealthy Tony offers to take care of them . Fair enough , except that the Comedy Four have their ' pride ' and won't accept ' charity ' . Why not consider it as compensation for taking care of an orphan who wasn't their responsibility ? Then we need an obstacle to the romance , so Sally visits Tony unexpectedly and finds some over-sized and unfashionable female clothes that look like they belong to Margaret Dumont . . . so , without giving him a chance to explain , she assumes that Tony's seeing another woman and she storms out . Oh , and Tony's aunt Hortense won't approve of the marriage if she finds out that Sally is a ( gasp ! ) entertainer . So what ? Those female clothes are part of the drag act of Billy House , a man of huge girth and microscopic acting talent . For implausible reasons , he masquerades as an aristocratic Englishwoman to call on Aunt Hortense . Their scenes together are excruciating : actress Alice Brady ( as Hortense ) borrows Billie Burke's twee mannerisms , and she actually comes off here as an even phonier female impersonator than House does . American actor Billy House's phony British accent is half-acceptable , which makes me wonder why he didn't attempt an English accent in the movie ' Bedlam ' , in which he played a genuine Englishman . After House finishes impersonating an Englishwoman , he utters some of that de-rigueur dialogue about how it ' sure feels good ' to get back into male clothing ( so we won't get any - - ahem ! - - ideas about him ) . House is the least talented of the four lead actors in this movie , yet he plays the leader of their vaude act","{""output"": ""NO""}"
724,"Text1: The very first stop-action animation . I viewed a print of this short film in the archives of the British Film Institute . ' Matches : An Appeal ' is the earliest known example of stop-animation , or indeed any form of movie animation . It is therefore of vital historic importance despite its crudity . The very brief film shows a stick-figure made of matchsticks , who climbs a stepladder to swab a paintbrush against a wall . In a technique that probably looked extremely unconvincing even to contemporary audiences , words form on the wall , presumably painted by the match-man . The message reads : ' For one guinea Messrs Bryant & May will forward a case containing sufficient to supply a box of matches to each man in a battalion with the name of the sender inside ' . As the film is dated 1899 ( when matches were still comparatively expensive items ) , presumably the battalions are British troops serving in the Boer War . However , I spoke with a curator at BFI who absolutely asserts that this film was made in the early 20th century and accordingly refers to the Great War . As I viewed an acetate dupe print rather than the original footage , I shan't offer any opinion as to this film's provenance . By modern standards , this film is almost laughably crude . But its historical significance is undeniable . I'll rate this very short film .


Text2: Rhett in China Even toward the end of his marvelous career , Clark Gable's screen persona of the charming , irresistible bounder was untarnished . Unhappy with the roles MGM was giving him , he did not renew his contract . "" Soldier of Fortune , "" which Gable subsequently did for 20th Century Fox , is a big budget , good-looking movie with big stars , none of which can hide the fact that it's a routine story that John Hodiak could have done in black and white in 1950 and probably did . Susan Hayward plays a woman who arrives in Hong Kong to look for her photographer husband ( Gene Barry ) who has slipped into China illegally . She runs into of a bunch of sleazy characters and finally meets Henry Lee ( Gable ) , a soldier of fortune with money and contacts . He's an older version of Rhett Butler - out for himself but capable of goodness as well . He falls hard for Hayward and becomes more determined than ever to find her husband so he doesn't have to compete with a ghost . With two such attractive stars , it's obvious what's going to happen . The stars and the supporting cast - Michael Rennie , Tom Tully , Anna Sten et al - are all very good . It's a beautifully photographed film that undoubtedly looked great on the big screen with its Technicolor panoramas of Hong Kong , but alas , it's not very exciting . Gable looks fantastic and immaculate in his white suit , his smile as dimpled and his voice as gruff as ever , and Hayward , not the warmest actress who ever lived , is excellent as a concerned and confused woman . They work very well together . It's hard to say the movie is not worth seeing because as excellent as some of our actors are today , there are no Gables . There was only one - and checking him out is always worthwhile .

"" Having just watched the original "" Jungle Jim "" movie from the prior year , I couldn't help noticing how similar the plot elements were for this follow up film , as the jungle hero agrees to help Zoron , the leader of Zom , from trespassing white men who would plunder the kingdom of it's treasure . Which wouldn't have been so enticing if Jim hadn't agreed to offer the villains a handful of diamonds each to agree to stay away . Now there's a strategy , and Jim was supposed to know the mind of greedy white men ! If you enjoy a good healthy dose of goofiness with your jungle flicks , this one will be right up your alley . Jim battles crocodiles and sharks , usually after an impressive dive into the water to keep viewers reminded of his genuine Olympic prowess . Throw in a small army of men in gorilla suits and you have the makings for a rousing finale to defeat the bad guys ; you know your main villain is truly evil when he kills his own niece early in the story . Those gorillas looked awfully similar to the ones played by Ray "" Crash "" Corrigan in a whole load of ape films from the 1940's and 50's , so it came as no surprise to learn that the movie itself was filmed at the Corriganville Ranch in Simi Valley , California . I didn't know Corrigan had understudies . I had to do a double take when Chot ( Paul Marion ) , son of Zoron , reminds his sister Li Wanna ( Elena Verdugo ) that it's forbidden for any white person to see the land of Zom . Hmm , and that was shortly after she led Jungle Jim to Zom to meet her father . No sense letting inconsistency in the story line stand in the way of an entertaining jungle flick . For anyone keeping track , this film's entry in the ' non African animals appearing in an African setting ' would be the quick stock shot of a South American toucan .

Fortunately too , the movie itself comes in at slightly over an hour , not too strenuous for the attention span if you go for this kind of stuff like I do .

Text2: A man of God "" Nazarin "" directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico . As written by the director and Julio Alejandro , his notable collaborator , this was a film that put Mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year . It's a disturbing film because Mr . Bunuel delves deep into what's wrong with the church . Nazarin , by all reckoning , is a saint . This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city . He doesn't have enough for himself , but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help . At the same time , he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman . Andara , the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building ! Nazarin is seen taking to the countryside begging for food . Andara and Beatriz , two prostitutes from his old town follow him . Nazarin's life parallels that of Jesus . In fact , this saintly figure makes a case for humility . Of course , Mr . Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr . Alejandro took it upon themselves to create this film . It's ironic how Spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing Christian qualities , when in reality , this is an acerbic satire on the catholic church and its ministers . Francisco Rabal , the Spanish actor , makes a wonderful Nazarin . This was one of his best roles . Mr . Rabal worked extensively in his native country , but also in Mexico and Argentina . Rita Macedo , as Andara , is also excellent . Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of Beatriz . A great film by one of the cinema's master film makers : Luis Bunuel .

Considering that she lost the Oscar to her co-star , Shirley MacLaine , who is reasonably good but far more one-note , I'd say we had a major Academy Award injustice there . Jack Nicholson is fun to watch and has some amusing lines , and most supporting roles , like those played by John Lithgow and Danny De Vito , are also first-rate and completely believable .

I think lot's of people were worried after "" The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers "" after seeing the battle of Helm's Deep . How was Peter Jackson ever going to top that great battle ? Well , with "" The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King "" he topped it alright ! The battle for Middle Earth is something you've never seen before . Greatest moment was when the riders of Rohan charged , it was really a moment in which you felt the true meaning of fighting and dying with honor . Also great moment during the immensely large battle were the fights against the oliphaunts , just when you thought the battle was over , those large creatures appeared ! Really great moment . The characters are possibly at their best in this movie . No characters need introductions anymore and we get to see the deepest of their emotions in this movie , even Gollum's ! Still the movie is not really deserving to be third in the top 250 here on IMDb . com . It's also not really deserving all those Oscar's it won . Like all The Lord of the Rings movies , it's great , spectacular and absolutely breathtaking at times but not classic masterpieces in my book . Also the movie is far from flawless . Once again the editing is just poor at times and what was with the ending ? Couldn't they just think of one ending ? I expected the end credits to start rolling multiple times during the ending but it just went on and on . Despite some of those flaws it still is an excellent movie with some unforgettable battle's sequence's . Truly a wonderful ending for one of the greatest movie trilogies in history .


Text2: The Mummy's Ghost Lon Chaney Jr returns to lumber along as the mummy Kharis seeking his mate , Annanka whose soul now resides in the beautiful host of descendant Amina ( Ramsay Ames ) . Andoheb , High Priest of Arkan ( George Zucco ) leaves Yousef Bey ( John Carradine ) in charge of Kharis to continue their evil-doing ways . Tom ( Robert Lowery ) must find a way to save his beloved Amina from certain future mummy terror . Routine , predictable entry in the Kharis series proves that nearly every film follows a specific format / formula . The city is threatened by a skulking , one-armed corpse masked in wrapping who seems to have been gifted with superhuman power to choke the life out of able-bodied men who are restrained with relative ease by a mere chokehold from Kharis . Frank Reicher , who saw Kharis in action . . and knows a great deal about Egyptian history . . in the previous film ( The Mummy's Tomb ) , proves that anyone who happened to survive a previous encounter with the mummy is sure to die if he returns in the next flick . Well produced , but lacks originality that would set it apart from the other films in the series . Sadly , Carradine sleepwalks through his role as the evil Yousef Bey . Embarrassing script mistake has Kharis , who is known for donning a crippled , lame right arm , carrying an unconscious Amina with both arms for long distances with no ill effects . One aspect , the shocking climax where Tom's attempt at heroism doesn't go according to plan as Kharis holds his damsel-in-distress hostage , lifts the film from the doldrums slightly .

731,"Text1: Absolutely repulsive & grim horror short This "" portrait "" of a serial killer is extremely short , but nevertheless long & detailed enough to make your stomach turn inside out ! Jim Van Bebber ( "" The Manson Family "" ) and Mark Gillespie introduce a fictional cannibalistic psychopath who spends his days grinding and devouring raw animals he picked up from the streets and yelling at the most stupid programs on TV . His living room is a total mess , with blood stains on every wall and flesh-leftovers in every filthy cover . Martin then goes on the road and picks up a young couple whose car broke down . Shortly after , the girl is locked up in a cage while the boy lies on a nasty operating table , waiting for his head to get cut off . The movie ends with images clearly indicating John Martin prepared his victims for evening TV-dinner . "" Roadkill "" is truly repulsive , with Van Bebber's camera zooming in on all the graphic details . It would normally be a pretty forgettable short feature , but somehow Van Bebber & Gillespie manage to create a solid morbid atmosphere that makes "" Roadkill "" much more effective and petrifying that most serial-killer flicks . The tone and filming style are indescribably nihilistic and raw , while Mark Gillespie scares the hell out of you as the titular madman . The music exciting and the filthy set-pieces are awesome . I didn't really care for "" The Manson Family "" or "" Deadbeat at Dawn "" , but Van Bebber's insane short films are total winners .


Text2: Disney's "" Pinocchio "" was scarier ? Nice try ? but that's about the only positive thing you can say about this lackluster attempt to blend psychological thriller with eerie horror monsters . The script desperately tries to be intelligent and innovating but the result is a very poor and tedious movie , even for the already low 90's standards . The story handles about an overly ambitious psychology student who motivates a clique of people to go on a mountain-weekend where he'll finish his thesis about phobias . The point is that all the participants get over their fears by talking about them and , in the meantime , our college boy can process his own childhood trauma . Upon arrival , everyone's fear comes to life in the shape of a life-size wooden dummy . Of course the puppet means trouble ! It's made by Indians ? it's always the Indians with their spiritual evils , I tell you ! ! This movie takes itself way too seriously and the makers actually seem to believe that the subject matter is deep and complex ! It's not ! It's more than obvious that every character hides one of several dark secrets and the viewer figures them all out long before they reveal the "" truth "" themselves . I've rarely seen a movie so predictable than "" The Fear "" . The story gets more and more annoying near the end and , the more clever it tries to be , the more ridiculous it all looks . The wooden "" evil personified "" dummy isn't very impressive and the squeaky stretching-sounds he constantly makes aren't my idea of eerie sound effects . Pinocchio actually was a lot scarier ? at least he could do tricks with his nose . The acting performances are forgettable , even though I'm sure the guy who came up with the idea to offer Wes Craven a small role is very proud of himself . In case you're looking for some really unsettling evil-dummy horror movies , check out "" Pin "" ( brilliant but disgracefully underrated 80's thriller ) and "" Magic "" ( staring a young Anthony Hopkins "" .

He then encounters a couple of young apes . One of them gets in trouble with Bosko so he opens the baby's butt-fur and attempts to spank him ( this was obviously pre-Code ) . The father arrives .

Everyone else drew a blank though I also found out Rex Allan , who guests here in blackface , was also a narrator in films like the original movie versions of The Incredible Journey and Charlotte's Web . Mostly enjoyable musical despite the blackface number near the end that I just referred to . For that reason , more sensitive souls should proceed with caution .

It makes the 1939 version look like today's advanced technology , in comparison . The sky , for instance , looks like a cheaply painted paper mache that just moves right to left . That is supposed to indicate a windy day and looks so hokey you watch this in amazement . But , it's 1910 , and the very early years of motion pictures , so I am not ridiculing it . In fact , it makes you marvel how much they advanced in just several decades of film-making after this was made . It is interesting to note some of the differences in the story , too , such as Nebraska being mentioned instead of Kansas , but this was adapted from a stage play , not the novel ( as the ' 39 film was ) . Differences aside , it was still fascinating to watch because it's almost like going to school and watching your kids in some Middle School production ! Once again , I am not slamming it because I realize when it was made and appreciate the effort . . . . and historical value of this film . Also , it's hard to get much of a story in when the film's running time is only 13 minutes . Note : a young Bebe Daniels plays "" Dorothy .

Text2: LT Writers Spoof Themselves We see something unusual right off the bat in this cartoon : a quick picture of something that isn't animated . In this case , it's a giant hamburger . That's what one of two starving guys on a raft out in the ocean sees , instead of his partner . The other guy soon is hallucinating , too , seeing food where human body parts are ! Thankfully , they are spared from these gruesome things as they spot an island and race there in their suddenly-speedy raft . Bugs Bunny , probably the only living thing on the small island , spots this ravenous duo and quickly sets his brain in motion . How he does NOT become dinner is the focus of this story . Along the way are some funny bits with graphics regarding language translations . It's also interesting that the two LT writers are the guys characterized in the cartoon ! Good for them ! It's always good to be able to laugh at yourself , so kudos to Michael Maltese and Tedd Pierce . I agree with the reviewers here : this is a classic cartoon , full of inventive sights that are guaranteed to make you laugh . No sense describing all of them .

There are some average one's : House of Wax , House on Haunted Hill , and War of the Worlds . Then there are the bad one's : Halloween , The Fog , and Psycho . Last House on the Left , my parents had absolutely held me from the original movie , but when I became an adult I rented the movie and watched it by myself , I was just so curious what they were trying to hold me back from , I wasn't really shocked with the movie , I could see how it was gritty and brutal in the day , but after seeing movies like I spit on your grave , Hostel , Dirty Harry , Casino , etc , it just didn't really effect me . So I was actually looking forward to a remake of this just to see what they would do with the story and I have to say that they not only made it better , it was just a very great horror film that made me want to take 15 showers afterwards . Mari and her family are going on vacation . When they arrive at the house , Mari asks to sleep in the guest house instead of in the main house . Mari's brother , Ben , had died one year earlier , and the family are still trying to adjust to his absence . She finds a necklace he gave her and puts it on . She decides to ride into town to see her friend Paige . Mari's mother , Emma , is cautious , but her father , John , lets her go . Mari meets up with Paige at the store where Paige is employed . A young kid named Justin approaches the counter and asks for a pack of cigarettes , which Paige does not give to him due to his age . Justin says that if they join him at his motel room , he will give them marijuana . Paige agrees and sells him the cigarettes . They drive to Justin's motel room and Justin and Paige enter . Mari waits in the car but notices they are taking too long . She enters the room where she finds Justin and Paige on the bed getting high . She joins them and they decide to give Justin a makeover . They are interrupted by Krug , Sadie , and Francis . Krug explains that it is too risky to let Paige and Mari live . They decide to not only murder but rape the young girls . The gang goes to Mari's house not knowing that's where she's staying with her parents , her parents welcome the gang in thinking they got into a car accident . But Mari somehow survives and comes back home ; her parents discover that the people they've been helping are the same people that just tried to murder their daughter and now it's time for justice . This is the movie that you cannot wait to see justice brought to these sleazebags , they were so disgusting , I was just screaming and cheering in the theater . Like the tag line said , if bad people hurt someone you love , how far would you go to hurt them back ? If that was my daughter , you wouldn't wanna know the sick things I would've done to these slimy people . The thing that made this movie so horrific was how realistic it was . The rape scene doesn't show much but is one of the most graphic and disturbing in cinema , even my 25 year old boyfriend had to cover his eyes , he said he was just incredibly sick from it because he can't imagine the pain she was going through . The performances are on and the story is great . I would say this is one of the best remakes in years , this is not for the faint of heart though , but if you're curious about the remake , trust me , this was a very respectful movie of the original horror story of murder and revenge .

735,"Text1: Two prisoners on the run "" The Defiant Ones "" is a truly great film starring Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier , both of whom earned their money and deserved their Oscar nominations in this exciting and moving film , beautifully directed by Stanley Kramer . Marlon Brando was to star in the movie but when it didn't happen due to Kramer having to wait for Poitier to finish a film , Curtis , complete with nose putty ( which he often relied on to make himself less handsome ) took over and showed what he could really do with a good role . Curtis and Poitier are prisoners . John , called Joker , and Noah , being transported when an accident on the road frees them . Though they have no love for one another , they're handcuffed together . Joker uses the ' n ' word and calls Noah "" boy "" - in fact , the racism in the film is rampant all the way through . At one point they wind up at a farmhouse where a horny woman ( Cara Williams ) lives with her son , and , freed from the cuffs , the two can separate ; the Williams character wants to go with Joker and take her car , and Noah can go through the swamp and get a train that goes by every day . But all the running , the filth , the wet , and nearly being lynched has caused a change to occur in both men . A very compelling movie , a little dated today , but it still holds up . Lon Chaney Jr . is excellent as a man who runs a turpentine work camp , and the other actors in the film are very good as well . Curtis said the men didn't have to be black and white , they just had to be two people who didn't like one another and were forced to survive together . That's true . Wonderful story starring two truly great actors .

Raymond Burr was appropriately sinister in the days before he was good guy Perry Mason . His elegant clothing belie his mean expression and sinister , callous actions . The problem for me was that the plot just did not hold my interest . The film seemed overly long and somewhat plodding . That being said , the highlight of the movie is Vincent Price , a swashbuckling actor on the way down who decides to turn reel life into real life . He is truly fabulous , and his role gives the movie a specialness it would not otherwise have . Mitchum and Russell made better films , together and separately .

My interest began to wane almost immediately and the scene where Macbeth's friend tells the drug lord of Macbeth's heroics kind of sealed the deal and I stopped watching and instead began to listen rather than watch ( or were the scenes reversed , I don't know I don't care ) . despite its awards down under the film just doesn't really work especially when the idea isn't a new one with earlier films like Joe Macbeth and Men of Respect floating around .

Text2: Where does Championship Lie - in the Body or in the Head ? SWIMMING UPSTREAM is a brilliantly acted , deeply involving and ultimately uplifting film from Australia that deserves major audience exposure . Based on a true story of one of Australia's many championship athletes , this story is not merely another biopic ( although it was autobiographically written by Anthony Fingleton , the subject of the film ) : this is a story about large families of poverty , about the tragedies that befall families husbanded by an alcoholic abusive father , and about the ultimate triumph of the individual soul rising out of such conditions . Harold Fingleton ( Geoffrey Rush ) is a drunk , a blue collar worker who has sired five children by a strong but enabling wife Dora ( Judy Davis ) , a man whose focus on sports finds a possible escape from his joblessness when he discovers that his two middle sons Tony ( Jesse Spencer ) and the younger John ( Tim Draxl ) are able swimmers . For reasons unclear Harold focuses on John and while he relentlessly coaches both of the boys at the town pool every day , he decides John is going to be the champion swimmer in Australia . Tony excels in the backstroke and eventually surpasses his beloved brother John's times and proceeds to win the honors Harold expected of John . Throughout this tale of competition in swimming we are privy to the competition within the home . Harold , Jr ( David Hoflin ) is initially the bully yet gradually succumbs to his father's alcoholic lifestyle . Dora is beaten and abused yet is always there for her children , eking out a living and soothing the flare-up tantrums during Harold's drunken states . Tony and John cycle through periods of mutual adulation and the alternative fierce competition into which they are thrown by their father : their evolving bond is unforgettably touching . When Tony at last reaches the peak of his swimming potential , winning medals and applause form his countrymen , he still tries to grasp the love of a father whose is so consumed by his own demons that he is unable to acknowledge Tony's success . Tony's eventual choice of leaving Australia for either the Olympics or for a scholarship to Harvard in the USA provides some of the most touching moments between the various members of this long-suffering family . The direction by Russell Mulcahy is keenly paced , making excellent use of flashbacks to the significant moments in the family's history , and electing to use the split screen technique to underline the tension of the swimming meets while focusing on the faces of the family . As Tony , Jesse Spencer is both wonderful to watch ( he does his own swimming and he is a perfect physical specimen ! ) and reveals acting gifts that are usually those of more seasoned performers . Indeed , Rush , Davis and Draxl also give spellbinding performances that are born of nuance and understatement . In a family where there could be polarization of response from the audience , each of the actors is so fine that we are able to find the complete personas of these disparate people and find warmth and understanding for all of them . One wonders why this film was not heralded in the theatrical release , as it is one of the finer movies to come out in years . Both Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis give outstanding , award deserving performances . The DVD includes all of the ' deleted scenes ' and it is highly recommended to view these important inexplicably cut moments as they truly enhance the film . Very Highly Recommended ! Grady Harp

I watched the film last night and I am very much in love with this movie , everything about it was just so sweet and lovely . This movie reminded me of the story of Oliver Twist , it's a different take on the story with the power of music and just listening . The cast , the story , the editing , the direction , the music , nothing is off about August Rush . Freddie Highmore has such an incredible talent for such a young age , but his face says so much and his acting is just perfect and makes the audience just fall in love with him . Keri Russell is just pulling in one great performance to another , from Waitress to August Rush , she's just lovely .

Evan is set to find his parents but come across a musical group of kids , who are making money for Wizzard , when Evan plays music , it's magical , Wizzard exposes Evan giving him a new name , August Rush and makes money off of him . But when Lyla finds out about her son being alive , she goes to New York to find him , Louis starts thinking about Lyla and finds out where she lives , Chicago , but when he finds out she's gone , he goes to New York to relive his band days , instead they find each other and the musical genius their love created . August Rush is one of the first films of the year that I'm rating a perfect 10 , because there is nothing wrong with this film , to be honest , I think it deserves a higher rating than a 7 . 4 . Is this a masterpiece ? No , I'm not sure if it will be remembered several years from now , but I do know that this was a great movie and I would be so happy to watch it again . It's perfect for the family to watch , it's perfect for a group of friends , or just even for yourself if you are looking for a good movie to watch .

This is what we are told in the advertising for the best picture nominee of 2007 - "" Atonement . "" The director should atone for giving us this kind of picture . We are dealing with nothing more than a little brat who accused her sister's boy friend of molesting a younger cousin of theirs . The story would have been far more exciting if the class angle issue would have been emphasized instead . The lad accused of the molestation was the son of a cook in the house . Despite his education and ambition to become a doctor , no one believed him , probably because of class distinction , and as a result he suffered imprisonment . The picture alternately fast forwards and goes back to make its point . The ending is most shocking , when some 40 + years later , the girl is now an elderly woman , portrayed by the venerable hag Vanessa Redgrave . As a child , Briony loved to write and it was probably her precocious attitude that stirred her imagination .

Bad and Laughable . Plot ? Bad . Lighting ? Bad . Cinematography ? Bad . Costume Design ? Bad and Silly . Everything Else ? Bad . Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal . Even for a fan of bad movies , it's a real endurance test . This is one for either masochists or Lou Ferrigno completists ( if any exist ) . Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules : 1 . If you don't have the budget for real special effects , rotoscope a scene from the previous movie . It will look great - trust me . 2 . When on a quest to recover Zeus ' thunderbolts , take time for frequent stops to oil-up you body . It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions . 3 . Any sword fight , use of magic , and just about all other day to day activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or Asteroids . 4 . Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars . 5 . If you need to pad your crappy movie's runtime , extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music .

Text2: "" You can't fall out of a closed window ! "" While I enjoyed watching Dr . Renault's Secret , the movie has one serious flaw that keeps it from being a real winner . The problem with Dr . Renault's Secret is that there really isn't much of a secret . Anyone with half a brain would be hard pressed not to guess what's going on within the first ten minutes of the movie . I have a hard time believing that even the less jaded horror fans of 1942 would have been shocked by the revelations made toward the end of the film about Dr . Renault and his assistant , Noel . The movie all but beats you over the head with its supposed "" secret "" . But even with this flaw , there's still a lot to enjoy here for fans of classic horror . To start with , J . Carrol Naish gives one of those wonderful performances that I'll remember long after having watched the movie . He's awesome as the strange Noel . The way he changes his body language as the movie goes on and his more animalistic tendencies start to come out is perfect . George Zucco gives his usual nice performance even though his role is limited . The film also very nicely shot . Dr . Renault's Secret features some top-notch cinematography , set design , lighting , and everything else that goes into make a movie look "" good "" . It might have been a "" B "" film , but it doesn't look like it . Fox didn't make many horror films , but when they did , they did it right . One final note ? it's odd to me that the movie is supposed to be set in France . While I don't necessarily have a problem with some of the British and American actors in the movie , there's just no way Arthur Shields could have ever been a French police inspector . He's way too Irish to ever be anything but Irish .

The chosen few who'll have the change to see it one day won't regret it . But it is hard to find . I taped it off TV once in the early 90's . I still have that tape and re-watched it recently . But it hasn't been on tv since . De Boezemvriend is all about the charismatic face of leading actor Andr√© Van Duin . He's a funny-looking reddish man , who uses different tones of voice when he speaks . He's a famous and well respected comedian in the Dutch-speaking countries . He did movies , TV-shows , stand-up comedy acts and a lot of other stuff . He was on the peak of his success when this movie was shot . . . you don't hear much about him nowadays and that's a shame . I was a huge fan of his and I still think he was the best comedian in all Belgium and the Netherlands . De Boezemvriend is set in the time of Napoleon . Van Duin character is some sort of dentist who has to run for Napoleon troops because the want to recruit him as a soldier . During his hike , he gets mistaken for a French baron and a close friend to the emperor . De Boezemvriend contains a few truly hilarious scenes and an overall funny screenplay . The costumes and decors are fairly decent and I consider that to be a huge positive point , since it's only a small Dutch production . Van Duin's facial expressions are a joy to watch and the ( former ) Dutch beauty Vanessa shows a LOT of cleavage . What more do you want ? ?


Text2: A strong , absorbing and effectively creepy horror winner Classy , worried Claire Ward ( the lovely Jane Sibbett ) hires smooth private detective John March ( the likable John Terry ) to find out what her secretive , obsessive husband Charles Dexter Ward ( a typically fine , intense and gripping portrayal by the always reliable Chris Sarandon ) has been doing in a remote woodland farmhouse he's secluded himself in . The pair discover much to their horror and dismay that Ward has found the key to immortality , which naturally comes at a truly terrible price . Director Dan ( "" The Return of the Living Dead "" ) O'Bannon , working from an intricate and intelligent script by Brent V . Friedman ( said script is based on a H . P . Lovecraft short story ) , deftly creates and sustains an arrestingly eerie and mysterious mood , keeps the pace plugging along at a steady clip , and coaxes solid performances from a sturdy cast ( Robert Romanus in particular is very engaging as March's wiseguy partner Lonnie ) . Moreover , Irv Goodnoff's glossy , graceful cinematography , Richard ( "" Re-Animator "" ) Band's soaring , supremely spooky score , and Todd Masters ' wonderfully grotesque creature f / x are all up to par as well . The film reaches its marvelously clammy , creepy and claustrophobic nerve-wracking zenith when March , Claire and Lonnie venture into the farmhouse basement and encounter the ghastly mistakes of Ward's previous failed experiments . Best of all , the grimly serious tone , judicious use of gore and monster effects , and gradual build-up towards a startling climax ensure that this feature works remarkably well as one hell of a fiercely unsettling scarefest . An excellent and unjustly overlooked sleeper .

Text2: A very entertaining short , but one thing puzzles me-why are they moving the rock ? This is a very good short , where the gags mostly revolve around the attempts of the Pink Panther and the little guy who regularly shows up in these shorts to move a very large rock . I have know idea why they're moving the rock . I suppose the answer to that is "" Because it's there "" . I want to give some details in this comment , so there are spoilers here : This short opens with the Pink Panther and the little guy moving a very large rectangular rock when the Pink Panther has the idea that it would move faster and easier if it were round . Things move quickly-until they hit an incline , when they start moving much more quickly . The little guy winds up in the valley between two slopes . The astute observer no doubt realizes just how unfortunate this position is for him . A suggestion to any future cartoon characters finding themselves in similar circumstances-try moving laterally ! Along the way , the two try using vines to pull the block along , using logs to roll a rectangular block along and putting wheels on an axle ( this last results in a very "" Flintstones "" type of moment in one scene , which is very funny ) . While many of the gags are predictable , the timing on the gags is good enough for most of them to still be quite amusing . The ending gag is clever and a bit of a surprise initially . A nice touch . The short comes full circle , ending as it began-with the Pink Panther and the little guy trying to move a rock . This short is on the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection and is well worth watching , as is the collection as a whole . Recommended .

The story , which I kind of liked at first , hits a wall early on and the second half of the film is repetitive and very , very dull . Too bad , too , because I actually like the music of Al Jolson . I love his weird voice and bizarre delivery . The songs presented here do not represent Al at his best . While ' Tootsie ' and ' Blue Skies ' are wonderfully performed ( got to love the whistling in ' Tootsie ' ) , most of the other songs are bad . Most will probably cringe during ' Dirty Hands . ' And his rendition of ' Mammy ' at the end of his film is weak . I have a much better recording of that song . The blackface scenes are probably the least offensive I've seen . Most blackface numbers make fun of blacks . Jolson is only in blackface for two very short numbers . He doesn't even try to act black as most do ( see , for example , Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland in 1939's Babes in Arms ) . That doesn't make them good , of course . I don't see how Jolson even became a famous minstrel like this . It's hardly a blackface act at all ( mind that I'm not complaining , just finding it all interesting ) . The story has a very Jewish flavor , which I didn't know about and which provides some interest early on ( before the predictability and sentimentality sensors kicked in ) . .

Running into the remnants of a British 8th Army unit , the sides hook up to form an international group of ragtag soldiers whose fortunes shift more than the desert sands around them . Besides the inherent story of good versus evil , and freedom versus Nazi propaganda , the film also serves as an effective psychological drama in it's one on one vignettes focusing on members of the group . Particularly effective is the cat and mouse game played out by Bogey's Sgt . Gunn character and his German counterpart Major Von Falken ( John Wengraf ) . At this point in the picture , Gunn and company had virtually nothing to lose in a desperate gamble to hold off the enemy until support could arrive . Or would it ? In a brilliant scene , two Allied soldiers pretend to lavish themselves with bathing water , when it's just about all they have to share among ten men . But take your pick .

Each of the Allies in turn prove to be heroes in their own way while maintaining a soldier's discipline . Even Italian prisoner Giuseppe ( J .

749,"Text1: Famous The key for perhaps understanding Truman Capote's real character comes out during a conversation between him and Slim Keith . Truman Capote asks her , perhaps naively , why doesn't she ever open up to him , to which she clearly answers she'd rather not because everyone will know about it ! This author was a social butterfly , as he is caught in this amazingly acerbic picture by Douglas McGrath . The same people he cultivated will drop him like a hot potato in a few years because the book he is seen writing at the end of the movie : "" Unanswered Prayers "" . "" Infamous "" delves into Truman Capote's obsession with the crime committed in Holcomb , Kansas , in the late fifties , in which a family of four were killed in a heinous crime committed by a pair of misguided criminals who actually got away empty handed . Mr . Capote , in turn , falls under one of the murderer's spell after he gains entrance to interview him for the book he intends to write . Things obviously weren't as easy for even a celebrity writer from New York , when Capote , accompanied by his friend Nelle Harper Lee , another novelist , come into town to investigate the crime . According to Mr . Capote , the book he is envisioning is reportage with fiction undertones , but as Ms . Lee wisely points out to him , if he wants to make a book of fiction , where will the fantasy fit in the book . Truman Capote , with his effeminate mannerisms , was not welcomed in Holcomb . He , and Ms . Lee , weren't given the time of the day ! The lucky break comes as the local prosecutor's wife invites the visitors to come and have a Christmas dinner with them that he is able to penetrate this conservative society by using the charm that had made him a celebrity among the rich ladies that lunch crowd in Manhattan ! By mentioning his connection to the Hollywood movie crowd , he dazzles the same people that didn't want him around . After all , he had been around enough notables himself to last him for life . His society connections open the door for him to go ahead with his book project . As he gains Percy Smith's confidence , there is a hint about homosexuality on the convict's part . Truman Capote feels dazzled by Smith and also falls under his charms and good looks . Their intimacy is what enabled the author to finish his novel , although he needs to wait for the two men's execution in order to bring the book to full closure . In a powerful scene at the jail cell , Truman Capote bares his soul about his life and the tragedy of her mother , a woman who wanted to belong to society , but must face the fact she didn't belong . Douglas McGrath , the excellent director , working with the material of George Plimpton's book , made a wonderful movie about Capote . Where Mr . McGrath succeeds is by presenting Truman Capote's inter action with the society people he loved and catered to . Mr . Capote was a valuable ally for most of the rich women in the circle in which he made himself essential . After all , he was a witty man with the right epigram for the right occasion and the latest bit of dirt about people in the New York society . Toby Jones gives a great performance as Capote . His mannerisms , his voice , and his witticism are perfectly captured by this diminutive man that makes us believe he is nobody else but Truman Capote . Sandra Bullock transforms herself in the unassuming Nelle Harper Lee , a true friend . Jeff Daniels is also at his best as Alvin Dewey . Among the rich ladies portrayed in the film , Sigourney Weaver makes an impression as Babe Paley , especially dancing with Capote at El Morocco . Hope Davis appears as Slim Keith ; she has a couple of good moments . Juliet Stevenson's take of Diana Vreeland is pitch perfect . Daniel Craig , with his darkened hair , appears as Percy Smith . Gwyneth Paltrow is only seen at the beginning of the movie as a chanteuse . "" Infamous "" has a intense dark cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel . The film was shot in closed interiors where Mr .

750,"Text1: A painful miscarriage of a film . . . First and foremost I'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie "" Embryo "" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses ( animal as well as human ) aged 12-16 weeks . The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase . Okay , in all honestly , I didn't know all this , but I took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of "" Embryo "" could have done . Don't worry ; I'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter , as there are several more reasons to state why "" Embryo "" is a huge failure . Actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible , and thus Science Fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious , yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences . By depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong , or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light-years of void , filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and , at the same time , teach them useful little trivia about science . In order to make a good or at least halfway-decent Science Fiction movie , writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule : DON'T be boring ! If they can't fulfill this one condition , the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book . Something must have gone wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's "" Embryo "" . The basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving , as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies . There also were some very prominent names involved in the production , like main stars Rock Hudson ( "" Giant "" , "" Seconds "" ) , Diane Ladd ( "" Chinatown "" , "" Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore "" ) and director Nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics "" Soldier Blue "" and "" Charly "" . Then what went wrong ? Simple . The script is irredeemably boring , clich√©d and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery & scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with . Rock Hudson , in a very poor performance , plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away . When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night , his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals ' fetuses . He manages to keep one fetus alive , impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog . Because his procedure is so successful , Dr . Paul Holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide . The female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate , however , and after only a couple of weeks she's a full-grown , ravishing and super-intelligent woman . The good doctor naturally falls in love with her , but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects . . . Absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film , apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog . That second half of the film does contain a little bit of ( grotesque ) action and suspense , but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot-twists already ruined the potentially fabulous Sci-Fi idea . There are some really cool scenes , most notably the chess-showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall ( in a highly memorable and ultra-obnoxious supportive role ) . The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous , and it almost feels like Ralph Nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller & Sci-Fi cinema . The last sequence , including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end , certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film . But anyway , my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers . An animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film .

Multiple scenes are loaded with tension and leave you with a very uncanny aftertaste in your stomach .

752,"Text1: Hugely clever and loving homage to the serials of the 1940s and ' 50s This forgotten gem from 1982 was made by Steve Martin and Carl Reiner after the success of "" The Jerk . "" In my opinion , "" The Jerk "" is superior if only due to its oddball silliness , but technically speaking "" Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid "" is probably better . And I do think it's still a very good comedy , sadly forgotten over the years . It is hugely original and one of the only films I know of to do such a thing . Essentially it places Steve Martin into B-movie serials of the ' 40s and ' 50s , so he can talk to Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney . When I first heard of this , I thought maybe they used advanced techniques to literally place Steve Martin IN the previous movies . They don't . Instead , they painstakingly recreate sets from the older films , and shoot footage of Martin . Then , they cut away to shots from the older films , and then back to Martin . Reiner often uses substitutes from behind when Martin is interacting with them in the scene , in one frame . I do believe now with the advent of CGI and so on and so forth this could be done even better , technically speaking , and we could literally place Steve Martin in pre-existing films , rather than watching him interact around them . In my opinion it's cleverer and harder to do what they did here . For the times , this must have been incredibly modern and unseen . Since "" Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid "" we've seen animation combined with actors ( "" Who Framed Roger Rabbit "" ) and a few other such projects , but "" Plaid "" remains one of a kind due to its sheer love of the material it is spoofing . The jokes are sometimes a bit too silly and over-the-top , but it's still a great little comedy . Steve Martin is at his best here before he started making stuff like "" Cheaper by the Dozen . "" Martin and Reiner's trio of slapstick comedy - - "" The Jerk , "" "" Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid "" and "" The Man with Two Brains "" - - offer plenty of laughs and I'd highly recommend "" Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid "" to any film buff who's searching for something unique and different .

Monique had a positive energy , at times I admit she could be over the top and annoying , but I didn't find her character to be horrible , but actually more believable . Jazmin is a big girl in a small girl's world where she can't find any hot clothing for her size and wishes to help other big girls feel beautiful and sexy . But she is ignored and criticized for her outgoing personality and her plump figure . She wins a trip to the Carrabean Islands with her thin cousin and her other plump friend . There she meets and incredibly handsome doctor who loves her figure and finds big women to be very attractive and helps her realize that maybe with a little confidence she could be on top of the world and smile with her killer fashion designs . I lost a lot of weight , I used to be a "" phat "" girl , so I think that's why I enjoyed the film somewhat , because I could relate . Besides that , this was just an average comedy that people are taking way too seriously . I think if you let go and just have some fun , you'll like the film , just ignore the ignorant people who are just hating this film because there are big women in it , it's just a cute romantic comedy with a positive message .

753,"Text1: Another Don Siegel Thriller Masterpiece - and Walter Matthau Shows What His Villains Might Have Done I always had a small wish , now totally impossible to consider doing . Up to the time Cary Grant died in the 1980s I wished he , Audrey Hepburn , and Walter Matthau could have re-shot the conclusion of CHARADES . Matthau played one of his excellent villains , although with comic moments . But after 1964 Matthau won a place in our hearts as Whiplash Willy Gingrich , Oscar Madison , Horace Vandergelder , and dozens of other curmudgeons . They were crooked at times , and could be nasty - but they were nasty to the idiots that annoy us . So I reedited the end of CHARADES , so that Walter Matthau remained Hamilton Bartholemew of the State Department , and Cary Grant was Carson Dial . Matthau , somehow blundering into saving Hepburn's Mrs . Lambert at the end would have been as memorable a conclusion as the actual film's end today - possibly more so . In 1964 Walter Matthau rarely played heroes . His wise television executive who tells off a destroyed but scheming Andy Griffith in A FACE IN THE CROWD was an exception . But afterward , with a well deserved Oscar for Willy , Matthau got better leading roles , as well as film partnership with his perfect "" fencing "" mate Jack Lemmon . As one of the fans of the evil as well as the "" shady-nice "" Matthau , I have often wondered if he could have appeared as more of a conniver and schemer ( outside of Billy Wilder's films ) in his later career . The answer ( outside of Wilder ) is found in this film , CHARLIE VARRICK . It is surprising that Matthau apparently disliked it , but he may have felt that it was too mechanical ( thrillers , like melodramas , can be like that ) . But it enabled him to play a man who was not beyond planning or setting up deadly violence for his own sake . And he gets away with it in the end . This film suggests a possible career twist that Matthau never had to follow , but could easily have been his had the motion picture business of the 1960s - 2000 been run like it had been run in the heyday of the studios . Just like the typecasting of Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre , one can imagine the typecasting of Walter Matthau in such roles as Charlie Varrick back in the 1930s - 1950s . Varrick and his wife had been in a daredevil airplane act for years , but found less and less jobs . So they turn ( with their mechanic and Harmon Sullivan - Andy Robinson ) into small town bank robbers . But the bank they rob turns out to be a nightmare . There is a shoot out with unexpected local police ( headed by William Schallert ) . Schallert is wounded and a deputy killed , but so was Varrick's old mechanic and Varrick's wife . Varrick is able to transfer himself and the bank loot , and Harmon to a truck , and Harmon blows up the getaway car . Varrick and Harmon go to their home in a trailer park , and discovers that the money in the bags is far more than the $10 , 000 . 00 or so they expected ( it is more like $750 , 000 . 00 ) . When Varrick hears of the robbery report on the news , he learns a much smaller amount is reported stolen . Varrick soon realizes it is an illegal bank - a Mafia drop off bank . In the meantime , a hit-man named Molly ( Joe Don Baker , in a wonderful sociopath performance ) has been hired by the Mob to go after the thieves . But he has considered that it is odd that the bank robbery occurred when it did - just after the Mob sent so much money to the bank for money laundering purposes . He tells his contact ( Benson Fong ) of his suspicions , and Fong and he agree to include the head of the bank ( John Vernon ) as a leading suspect . Varrick has problems with his partner Harmon , who wants the money split now ( wise old Charlie realizes they have to wait at least ten years to do it safely , and they have to spend it very slowly not to raise any suspicions ) . Harmon warns Charlie not to cross him . Charlie , disgusted and angry , says , "" Okay Harmon ,

Text2: An Unforgotten , Tragic Footnote The tragedy of the week and a half reign of "" Queen "" Jane Grey Tudor is one of the bizarre briefly successful coups that collapsed . Lady Jane Grey was a blood cousin of King Edward VI , and his two half sisters , Princess Mary and Princess Elizabeth . Edward VI is recalled today , if at all , for the novel by Mark Twain called THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER , as the son of Henry VIII who trades places with the poor street boy Tom Canty . That was a piece of creative fiction , but it shows how relatively unimportant Edward VI really was because he died after a six year reign ( 1547 - 1553 ) in which he was never an adult but under a series of grown-up advisers called protectors . The first one was his uncle Edward Seymour , Duke of Somerset . Somerset's attempt to carry out the religious policies of his late brother-in-law King Henry VIII came apart due to the opposition of other powerful nobles , and the antics of his ambitious and stupid brother Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour . Thomas Seymour had married King Henry's last queen , Catherine Parr , and when she died , he attempted to carry off and marry the Princess Elizabeth . He was arrested and executed for treason ( this is the story in the Steward Granger film YOUNG BESS ) . It seriously compromised Edward Seymour , who was overthrown , tried for treason , and executed as well . The man who gained by all this was Edward Dudley , Duke of Warwick ( Cedric Hardwicke in the film TUDOR ROSE ) , who was made Duke of Northumberland by King Edward VI , and was Lord Protector when Edward was dying . Northumberland was too ambitious , as Thomas Seymour had been . Seymour hoped , by marrying Princess Elizabeth , to have her replace King Edward when he died , and he would be the real power behind Elizabeth's throne . As it was , Seymour actions were to bring Elizabeth under a cloud of unjust suspicion for awhile ( there is no evidence that she had agreed to this harebrained scheme ) . But Northumberland considered the situation similarly to Tom Seymour . He did not want to see Princess Mary , the oldest of the two half sisters ( and a Catholic ) succeed Edward . But he thought Elizabeth ( already showing her brains and independence ) unmanageable . Instead , he turned to their cousin Lady Jane Grey . Northumberland figured that Lady Jane would be a perfect match for his son Guilford . So Northumberland plotted two steps . First , he arranged Lady Jane and Guildford be married . Then he arranged that the dying Edward be pressured into altering the line of succession , disinheriting both his half-sisters , and putting his cousin on the throne . It was not too difficult to manipulate the poor dying boy , but Northumberland failed to realize that unless he could fully count on a sizable number of nobles accepting this weird dynastic switch it would be doomed . That was the failure of the scheme . Although Edward's death was followed by the announcement of the reign of Queen Jane , the public did not buy it . Lady Jane was known from being a court personage , but she was a non-entity for all that . Both Mary and Elizabeth were far better known , moreover they were the children of King Henry VIII ( not of one of his sisters ) . As for the nobles , they had not liked Tom Seymour's scheme with Elizabeth , so why should they like Northumberland's scheme with Jane and Guildford ? The Protestant nobles and government officials , like William Cecil , favored the Protestant Elizabeth . The Catholic nobles and even some Protestant clergy ( like Stephen Gardiner ) favored Mary . All Northumberland's stupid plan did was to unite the two rival Princesses factions in a determination to remove a usurper . It's amazing she lasted nine days . One can only conclude that due to communication problems in 1553 , and a general sense of amazement at the speed of this coup , nobody acted quickly at first . But once they got over it the two factions united and poor Lady Jane was removed to the Tower of London . Interestingly enough she had barely known young Guilford , but now they got to know each other - and found they actually liked , even loved each other . One of the supreme tragedies of this story is that Jane Grey and Guilford","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Platform is a very amorphous film . Perhaps it has more meaning to those who might know the referents better than I , the various places in China which are visited . But the fact remains that the loose , repetitive , episodic structure mixed with the total lack of character development hinder much of the possible enjoyment or involvement .

Text2: Too familiar in its story to be a really great movie A small film about a big man . Mickey Rourke is , as you've certainly heard , outstanding as an aging wrestler who was famous back in the ' 80s and still plugs along at small events . Small those events may be , but they don't skip on the showmanship . One particularly brutal match rubs out the possibility of any more , and he has to take his life into perspective . He tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter ( Evan Rachel Wood ) and form a real relationship with a frequently-visited stripper ( Marisa Tomei ) . Frankly , my opinion of the film is lower than that of most who have seen it . When The Wrestler focuses on wrestling , it's spectacular . It's very detail-oriented , and you can just sense how much Rourke , the big lug , loves it . And the aforementioned brutal match is sure to be one of the most shocking things you'll see in any 2008 film . I rarely am disturbed by what I see in a movie , but I was wincing hard at it . When the plot kicks in , though , I just found it to be utterly predictable . It's made out of three basic clich√©s : the old pro who desperately wants to re-achieve his former glory , the family member connecting with an estranged family member and the sex worker unsure of whether she should cross the line between her profession and her feelings . I could never get very excited about it , because I felt I knew exactly where it was going and I never was wrong .

For fans of the film ( or the stage show ) , this is a very informative and detailed look at the origins of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical with incisive comments from the men who can tell it best : Andrew Lloyd Webber himself , Harold Prince ( on the stage version ) , composer Charles Hart , singer Steve Harley , Cameron Mackintosh , and Joel Schumacher . All of them have something important to contribute to our understanding of just how the whole project evolved from an idea that occurred to Webber when he just happened to pick up a copy of the original novel and saw the possibilities of turning it into a musical work . Glimpses of the Broadway production are especially fascinating , as well as other musical portions of the documentary wherein Steve Harley and Sarah Brightman were used in a musical video tryout . Makes a good companion piece to watching the Andrew Lloyd Webber film version .


Text2: Fun surrealistic comedy . When you're watching an Alex van Warmerdam movie you know you're to get something interesting and unusual . He always fills his films with a large amount of surrealism but at the same time knows to keep his films accessible and watchable for the main stream public . It might very well be true that this movie is his best known and most appreciated movie . It's not the type of movie with a clear point or purpose but this doesn't prevent this movie from being simply an enjoyable one to watch . This movie is mostly so fun to watch due to its many eccentric characters and unusual settings . The entire movie is set in an housing development , that consists out of one long street , without pavement on the road , with a school and butcher shop . At the end of the road there is a bus-stop and an artificial planted small forest . This is their entire world . It's set in the ' 60's , which of course also gives the movie a certain atmosphere but really this movie could had also easily been set in modern time and it just wouldn't make that much different to the story or any of its characters . The movie is filled with lots of eccentric characters . Every characters has somethings strange or unusual around him or her , some more extreme than others . It are mostly this quirky little aspects about each and every character that makes this movie such a fine comedy , since its not a movie with an awful lot amount of dialog and its also a rather slow moving movie , with long stretched shots . The movie features some fine Dutch actors , though it seems sort of weird that the best and best known actors play insignificant supporting roles in the movie , such as Loes Luca and Jacques Commandeur . Jack Wouterse is a well known actor now but back in 1992 no one had ever heard of him and this also was one of his first ever roles . The most fun role is being played by Theo van Gogh , as Fat Willy , who constantly rides on his moped and terrorizes the street with it . I've always liked him better as an actor than as a director , or anything else . Like always , also Alex van Warmerdam plays a role in the movie and so does his wife , actress Annet Malherbe . It's true that the movie sort of looses it as it heads more and more towards its end but overall this movie remains perfectly watchable throughout - and above all also really fun to watch .

This is what we would now call a docudrama about the battle in and around Arnhem during the closing days of the Second World War .

Its very much a you are there sort of film that pretty much seems to tell it like it was . I ran across this film in a budget collection of World War two films and since I'm a big fan of a Bridge Too Far I thought I'd pick it up . I'm not sure which is the better movie . One is a huge Hollywood financed production , the other is a small scale gritty in your face film that certainly shows what it must have been like . One I like because I like the story and the spectacle , the other I like because it shows what it was really like , and how Hollywood's version was too neat and clean . As good as this film is it has two problems in my eyes . First off its a bit disjointed . The film is telling the whole story about what happened in and around Arnhem and things get lost , "" characters "" blend into one another . Part of this seems to be the result of the fact that the film seems to have been dubbed after the fact and it seemed to me that several people have the same voice . Its not bad but I began to feel awash in the proceedings . The second problem with the film is that its awfully stereotypically "" British "" . Everyone is low key and even keeled . Everyone takes everything in stride , even the fact that they are surrounded with seemingly no way out . Its all greeted with a levelness that seems wildly out of the "" ideal "" notion of the British soldier rather than reality . The attitude is fine for a while , but buy the half way point into the film I was shaking my head and giggling at the calmness of it all . For me it severely detracted from the proceedings and left me feeling very disappointed . Flawed or not this is a must see , especially for those who like the later inflated epic film .

The action is quite good and has a realistic feel and the performances are there and not the typical sort of posturing one often finds in films of this sort . It all works . Best of all the video production actually adds an immediacy that most movies shot on film don't have . This is one to consider if it hits cable or you see it in blockbuster .

761,"Text1: menage √† Trois Fran√ßois Truffaut's third film is generally celebrated as a benchmark in his filmography but also in the Nouvelle Vague and even of the whole French cinema . Once again , such paeans of praise for this good but by no means extraordinary work go beyond me . A lot of viewers seemed to have been conquered by this story which is basically a novel penned by Henri-Pierre Roch√© . The former reviewer at the Cahiers Du Cin√©ma who once lambasted major French filmmakers of the forties and the fifties was struck by the mix of improper and purity which suffused in the novel . This is what galvanized him to film this unique story , at least for him and for the supporters of the film . The first thing to bear in mind is that the starting point ( two men and a women living together for a long period of their lives ) isn't new . In 1933 , Ernst Lubitsch had signed a work called "" Design for Living "" . This sparkling comedy already sheltered a "" menage √† Trois "" and was much more enjoyable and accessible than Truffaut's arty work . "" Jules et Jim "" was also celebrated for its innovative directing and its stunning camera work . Okay , it's a bonus for the film but once again I could argue that there is nothing astounding about it . On the same year the movie opened in 1962 , John Frankenheimer cranked out the mind-boggling "" the Mandchurian Candidate "" . It's not the same kind of film at all but I was much more very taken with the filmmaker's camera work which worked wonders to serve a far-fetched but thoroughly riveting story . Frankenheimer's magnum opus did better since it heralded the political thriller which had its hour or rather decade glory in the seventies with works like Alan J . Pakula's "" the Parallax View "" ( 1974 ) . In "" Jules et Jim "" , the creative liberties dear to the New Wave clique are well present and enhanced to try to reflect the mood a sequence could convey , especially in the first half ( before the war ) which brims with happiness and lightness . The whole dovetailed to establish a good dose of escape and dream to the audience . Actually , Truffaut's movie is half successful in the way the first part ( before the war ) makes sense in my eyes . There is none disadvantage in watching a threesome of two men and a woman leading a freewheeling life without any major problems ( financial or other ) . But after the war , the second part veers to a somber direction and things go wrong because their demeanors are elusive to my mind . I don't understand their actions , their motivations , especially Jules ' . If he is so unfortunate with Catherine , then why doesn't he go away ? Catherine's character seems to be dangerous because she jeopardizes Jules and Jim's friendship . Catherine's behavior and persona leave me baffled . What doesn't facilitate things is that she pronounces one cue which can infuriate the ones who aren't touched by this story : "" I don't want to be understood "" . Besides , I do think that Truffaut's film is peppered with lines which seem ludicrous to me such as "" it's twenty to one "" , "" an angel is passing "" "" it's normal , angels pass at twenty of every hour "" . "" Jules et Jim "" is the Nouvelle Vague in all its splendor and its pretensions with an emphasis on the form rather than the content which remains unfathomable to me . Storytelling is not Truffaut's forte or otherwise it obeys to a form of logic which is out of reach to me . That's what I want to gently laugh at his contention that "" a film is a story and a story has to be told . Even in the cinema "" . But in spite of his tricks and devices to tell the steps of this story and make the characters likable ( use of neutral voice-over ) , I'm not touched at all . What to say about the cast ? Each actor has the head in the clouds , seems to act apart their respective roles . Hence , an impression of false . Jeanne Moreau is a remarkable actress but elsewhere and still today .

Text2: one of the saviors of horror and fantasy cinema ? Surely so ! Along with "" the Blair Witch Project "" ( 1999 ) , "" the Sixth Sense "" ( 1999 ) or "" the Others "" ( 2001 ) , this Japanese gem is a bonanza for the genre aforementioned insofar as it favors in real screenplays , pure psychological terror which is the leading thread to a crescendo . This crop of masterpieces constitutes a valid antidote to the flood of horror movies coming from the Hollywood firm in which a ton of special effects supersede cinematographic invention . But Hideo Nakata shows us that it is still possible to shiver with a minimum of means and a maximum of shrewdness . I watched Gore Verbinski's remake shot in 2002 prior to Nakata's original film and so I can compare the two works . I do think that it's every bit as good as the 1998 film from an artistic perspective . Both are terrific even if Verbinski tends to show more of the plot and its ambiguous sides and his reflection on the deadly power of TV and the media is more pronounced than in its Japanese ambassador . My general impression about Nakata's work is that his style is more thrifty and straightforward than Verbinski's with sparse moments and a nearly contemplative pace . Evolving in a Japan caught between a modernism epitomized by the TV and an archaism which wants to protect one-time manners and customs , the filmmaker made the good choice of favoring the suggested and the off-camera to mold an unnerving atmosphere . This makes the viewer's imagination work and also makes him feel ill-at-ease when he realizes that the frontier between the rational and the irrational becomes increasingly thin . Because if one has an inking about who shot these outlandish images , one doesn't know how they were filmed . Unsettling isn't it ? However , Nakata borrowed a little from American cinema : the first sequence with the two young girls all alone in a house in which strange phenomena occur echoes "" Scream "" . The character of the audacious estranged journalist who investigates a serious case has been seen many times before or since .

It caused so much stir that the evil Sadako became a cult character . Her figurine even dethroned the mask of Frankenstein and the killer in "" Scream "" in terms of popularity . "" Ringu "" also gave birth to a sequel and even a prequel , probably to shed more light on the mysterious character of Sadako and to work more the seam .

Text2: ! ! lebisreverrI "" Irreversible "" is an art house experience which tells a story of a happy young adult couple who suffer ; she through rape and he through revenge . There's little story in this uncomfortably harsh film full of sex , nudity , vulgarity , and violence . What story there is is told a chapter at a time in reverse chronological order so we see the unhappy conclusion first and work back toward the happier beginning . In addition to the backward flow , the film uses strange floating camera techniques which could cause motion sickness and ends with a long strobing blank screen which could induce seizure in some people and laboratory animals . Given subtitles , gross unpleasantness , and imagery which is annoying if not offensive , the only reason any normal nonpervert would want to view this film would be to experience it . . . presumably the same reason people ride roller coasters while screaming with joyful terror . Certainly not for everyone , "" Irreversible "" is not good or bad but it is different . Recommended for realists with a taste for art projects and bitterly harsh drama .

764,"Text1: The War Inside The War Inside , November 6 , 2007 By Grady Harp ( Los Angeles , CA United States ) - See all my reviews ( TOP 10 REVIEWER ) ( REAL NAME ) HOME OF THE BRAVE is one of those films that is difficult to critique : the message of how war permanently alters the minds and bodies of soldiers and their families is a meaningful one and one about which we need to be reminded . Irwin Winkler has made some good films ( DeLovely , Life as a House , Guilty by Suspicion ) , but in this film he seems to be working against the script by Mark Friedman which has a tendency to oversimplify emotions and thus loses its impact . The film begins in Iraq where each of the main characters is at least tangentially connected . Dr . Will Marsh ( Samuel L . Jackson ) is in a truck driven by Vanessa ( Jessica Biel ) and accompanied by soldiers Tommy ( Brian Presley ) and Jamal ( 50 Cent AKA Curtis Jackson ) when a roadside bomb explodes , maiming the hand of Vanessa , killing Tommy's best friend , making Jamal witness unnecessary civilian deaths , and placing Will in an impotent position as a doctor . Flash forward to Spokane , Washington where each of these four wounded people try to piece their lives together in a world that loathes the Iraq war ( not at all unlike the treatment of soldiers returning from the unpopular Vietnam debacle ) , trying to make sense of it all . The problem with the good idea for a movie lies in the too traditional plot lines . The actors ( especially Presley and Biel ) give it their all , but credibility enters and the smoke rises and we are left with a misplaced patriotism . The message is strong : the delivery of it is shaky . Grady Harp

765,"Text1: More low budget horror rubbish . The Black Magic starts as soon to be married Andrew ( Daniel Lennox ) & his two best friends Craig ( Brian Bianchni ) & David ( Guy Bracca ) are enjoying a holiday in Bangkok in Thailand , however the trip turns to tragedy & the three friends arrive back back home in the States looking to get on with their respective lives . Unfortunately all three begin to suffer various problems , from being fired to getting stabbed to having terrifying nightmares as an evil force out for revenge starts to ruin their lives & ultimately tries to take them . . . This American , Thai & Indonesian co-production was co-written & directed by Marc-Ivan O'Gorman & one has to say it's unusual to find a horror flick on the IMDb that doesn't have at least ten comments , in fact it's clear that horror is easily the most commented upon genre on the IMDb & I would guess that The Blck Magic is therefore a pretty obscure film & I have have to say that it pretty much deserves to be obscure & hopefully for the general public it will stay that way . The script by O'Gorman & producer Asun Mawardi takes itself very seriously & is probably best described as a supernatural horror thriller in the style of recent Japanese horror like Ringu ( 1998 ) & Ju-On : The Grudge ( 2003 ) with ghostly Asian women & wronged spirits out for some sort of revenge . Unfortunately The Black magic feels very much like an American attempt at recreating the success of these Japanese horror films & as such sticks a load of annoying American teens as the stars , sets some of it in Bangkok while the rest in America & pretty much uses all the clich√©s you know & are throughly bored of . From possession to righting a wrong before a ghost can rest in peace it's all here just without any of the scares or entertainment you would hope for . It's really boring & very slow , it's extremely predictable & there isn't even an explanation as to why Sita comes back from the dead . Director O'Gorman does alright & at least the film looks competent throughout although there's zero scares , there's no style & no atmosphere . The shots of Bangkok look like they came from a holiday program or travelogue & are surprisingly dull & flat as is the whole film really . According to the MPAA section on the IMDb homepage for The Black Magic this was rated ' R ' for strong violence , language , some sexuality & drug use , well it's go the language & drug use but there's no nudity & as for strong violence I didn't see any . A chicken has it's head cut off in a sacrifice , someone is stabbed in the stomach & someone is repeatedly stabbed in the throat at the end otherwise there's nothing here to get excited about . There's a touch of cheap looking CGI computer effects work as well . Technically the film is reasonably well made & better than a lot of low budget horror crap , unfortunately the story & film still suck though . The acting is OK , nothing brilliant but nothing too bad . The Black Magic is a poor attempt at a Japanese styled supernatural horror thriller which is a genre I don't like anyway so this was never likely to impress me , give this a miss & watch the American remake of The Ring ( 2002 ) instead as it's much , much better .


Text2: Great film , highly entertaining . Waxwork II : Lost in Time starts with a brief recap of the climax to the original Waxwork ( 1988 ) paying particular attention to the escape of the severed zombie hand , Mark Loftmaore ( Zach Galligan returning from the original ) & Sarah Brightman ( now played by Monika Schnarre ) think they have ended David Lincoln's plan to flood the world with evil & catch a taxi home . Unfortunately the severed hand goes along for the ride too . Once home Sarah goes to bed & the severed hand attacks & kills her Stepfather ( George ' Buck ' Flower ) , Sarah is accused of his murder & is put on trial . Sensing an injustice & that she will be found guilty Mark & Sarah head over to Sir Wilfred's ( Patrick Macnee ) mansion who they discover has left a message for them , they find his hoard of ancient artifacts & something called Solomon's Lockett which turns out to be a key to open doors to alternate dimensions . With the idea that they can gain proof of Sarah's innocence by travelling through time & space they enter a time door & find themselves in Baron Von Frankensteins ( Martin Kemp ) castle facing an angry mob of local villagers who want Frankenstein & his monster ( Stefanos Miltsakakis ) dead & anyone associated with him . . . Written & directed by Anthony Hickox , who also has a small cameo in the film , Waxwork II : Lost in Time is a worthy but not quite as good sequel to the great original . The script is one long homage & send-up to various other horror films but this time there are no waxworks involved . From the likes of Frankenstein ( 1931 ) to Alien ( 1979 ) , Dawn of the Dead ( 1979 ) , Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde ( 1941 ) , an awful Godzilla ( 1954 ) bit complete with terrible dubbing to add authenticity , Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1956 ) , Jack the Ripper ( 1959 ) , Nosferatu ( 1922 ) shot in black and white complete with subtitles & a jerky movement , The Haunting ( 1963 ) , the severed hand attacking Sarah's Spetfather is taken straight from the sequence in Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) when Ash fights his own possessed severed hand & they also come across a blood stained hockey mask at one point . The film moves along like a rocket & each segment provides variety although some get more screen time than others . One aspect where I thought Waxwork II : Lost in Time didn't do so well with was it's uneven tone when it comes to the balance between comedy & horror , one moment it tries to be a proper horror film with scares like the Frankenstein segment is to start with but then it suddenly descends into camp comedy as Baron Frankenstein is strangled his eyes pop out of their sockets & his brain shoots out the top of his head complete with comedy sound effects . The most developed segment is the climax set in medieval times which strangely isn't based on any other film that I can think of , there is a scene in this part where a big fat executioner complete with black hood approaches a woman tied up but instead of whipping or hurting her he pulls a feather out & starts to tickle her ! Director Hickox films with some style & there are some nice moments , some of the scene transitions , some of the angles & it's a good looking film throughout . Forget about any real scares as the comedy stuff dilutes it too much for it to be wholly effective . There is some decent gore , lots of spraying blood , brains , eyes , severed hands , zombies getting their heads shot off , aliens emerging from someones mouth & a guy hanging up with his chest cut open exposing his ribcage . Technically the film is good , some of the sets are a bit limited , it tries to remake Alien using two sets for instance . The special effects range from impressive to poor especially the rubbery looking alien & the awful Godzilla . The acting is campy which suits the material . The likes of David Carradine , Bruce Campbell , Marina Sirtis , John Ireland , Alexander Gudunov & Drew Barrymore all turn up in roles . Waxwork II : Lost in Time is a fun , entertaining film that most horror fans will surely enjoy to some extent . I'm","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Peters ( James Villiers ) , the head of the network , comes up with a novel idea to smoke Gilsen out . He dispatches the champagne-swigging biker Lucas Guardino ( Derren Nesbitt ) along with other assorted hoods to Gilsen's home - a small English country village - to create an atmosphere of terror . Each night , locals are roughed up , property is damaged , and fires started ( sounds like my home town on an average night ! ) . The police force consists of one tubby bloke ( Norman Mitchell ) on a bike , so the bad guys have a field day . They then go one step further by hiring MacGill ! Mac's investigations draw a dead end , the locals are uncooperative . He does not know why his employers want Gilsen so badly , but when a Scotland Yard detective named Hedley ( Gerald Sim ) and C . I . A . agent Kane ( John Brandon ) show up in the area , he begins to have doubts about their motives . . . Another good Edmund Ward episode . Unusually violent for the time , with Mac on the receiving end of another beating and in the climax the locals turn on the gangsters , pulverising them ( nothing like a good old fashioned lynch mob when it comes to meting out some honest justice , is there ? ) . Peters , unlike your average drug pusher , enjoys a high standard of living - quaffing expensive food and drink while making philosophical speeches about the nature of drug addiction : "" They ( the addicts ) are on a stupid trip to a dreamland that doesn't exist .

Text2: A perfectly putrid piece of pure trash Obviously made on the cheap to capitalize on the notorious "" Mandingo , "" this crassly pandering hunk of blithely rancid Italian sexploitation junk really pours on the sordid stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint : The evil arrogant white family who own and operate a lavish slave plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in hanky panky both each other and their various slaves .

Jim Carrey , in his first film starring role after achieving genuine stardom being the "" token white guy "" on TV's ' In Living Colour ' , plays the title character , who is hired by employees of the Miami Dolphins football team to locate and retrieve Snowflake the dolphin , the beloved mascot of the team . I really laughed hard when I went to see this in theatres ten years ago , and while I am smart enough to know how crude , silly , and infantile THE MOVIE ITSELF really is , I can't deny that I still laugh a lot . That is thanks in no small part to Carrey , who plays the role in all his manic , face-making , body-contorting glory . Carrey manages to be always funny in this role and he single-handedly manages to save the film from what might have been a disaster with a less talented comedic actor in the lead . As in "" Liar , Liar "" ( which re-teamed Carrey with "" Ace "" director Tom Shadyac ) everybody else is the straight man . There are no other funny roles . ( Then again , that seems to have been the pattern for most of Carrey's comedies , hasn't it ? ) Sean Young ( in what turns out to be kind of an embarrassing role ) and Courteney Cox both look great and there are some familiar faces in the supporting cast .

It seems that there was something that happened years ago & Salem was locked away , but is he the one responsible ? Apparently not , but the ones that are , well , they get visited at night ( hence the title ? yeah , I think so ) . This is filmed in Sweden and Denmark in the winter so it's pretty dreary looking , but that just adds to the mood of the film . Von Sydow is excellent in his role as the clever Salem . Trevor Howard plays a police inspector who is not discounting that something weird is going on but he's also not believing that it's possible that Salem is getting out , although one person claims to have seen him and the others that saw him , well , they're no longer available for comment . This is a well done film , with lots of clever twists , and well worth seeking out . .

768,"Text1: A Nutshell Review : The Duchess The trailers had tried to market this as drawing some parallels to the late Princess of Wales Diana Spencer's life , given the subject matter being a lady of royal lineage being subjected to a loveless marriage which comes complete with affairs and scandals . It had even superimposed her portrait on the trailer to suggest a deja-vu of history , given that the story here is based on real people and presenting a dramatized snapshot of their lives . Until of course Keira Knightley had to stand up and say that this movie tells its own story without the need for such cheap promotional gimmick . But frankly , the life of the Georgina , Duchesss of Devonshire ( Keira Knightley ) in late 18th century England , couldn't be anything less than similar in certain ways , if based on Amanda Foreman's biography which formed the basis for the film . At a young age and to the delight of her mother ( Charlotte Rampling ) , the Duke of Devonshire ( Ralph Fiennes ) proposes a sealing of families through marriage , where his sole concern is to have a male heir . He wastes no time in impregnating his young wife , and treats her nothing more than a baby - producing factory , given a girl baby after girl baby , in addition to stillborns and miscarriages . It's also a sign of the times where women have no rights , and are expected to perform their duty , of being a wife and mother , which also translates to having no say to what their husbands are doing . For the Duke , it means spending a lot more time with his dogs with no effort in communicating with a factory worker , and being the sex addict that he is , takes pleasure in bedding chambermaids within his castle , or even the Duchess ' good friend Bess Foster ( Hayley Atwell ) , who succumbs to trading her body for powerful influences in order to see her children , taken away by her estranged husband . As with most period dramas , it's a tussle between duty and love , and affairs of the heart . While the Duke's dalliances have taken a toil on his marriage , given that the Duchess one headstrong woman , we slowly see her relent and slide into resignation of her fate , but not before trying to perform a tit-for-tat with her lover , future Prime Minister Charles Grey . From the slate of movies in the period drama genre , it seems that such stories are becoming quite popular to be translated to the big screen , and I recall Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette , who was betrothed in similar circumstances just across the English Channel . Keira Knightley stars in yet another period drama , and she's quite an old hand at it already , which no doubt translates to her delivering her best performance thus far in the genre . She presents the pain of living a lie quite convincingly , having to put on a front in public , while behind the scenes get surprise after surprise at the revelation of her husband's true character . Ralph Fiennes seemed to be quite stoic this time round with nary an emotion , and given he is Voldermott , has no difficulty in playing the bastard of a character , using his influence and power for his personal gratitude , making no negotiations to wanting things his way . In fact , one wonders men in high positions back then , could get away with a lot of things , and their wield of influence no doubt carries a lot of weight . The Duchess doesn't present its themes in depth , and sought instead to have breadth in covering a broad range of topics , from social standing to England during the cusp of elections , and while it certainly has no lack of material to last its run time , it certainly hinges on its big name stars to carry the film on their collective shoulders . It's a very straight forward film , like watching the life and times of someone unfold in chronology , and those looking for some satisfying , compelling drama with deep tussles involving heart and soul , might want to look elsewhere instead . Nothing fancy here , but it works .

Text2: Dog ? Where ? I saw a bit of Dog Day Afternoon when I was about nine years old and left it this long before actually focusing on watching the whole film . Despite claiming to be the film expert that I am , I had little knowledge of what the film is actually about . Sonny and Sal ( that's Pacino and John Cazale ) and some other guy enter a bank in Brooklyn with the intention of robbing it . But they simply couldn't be less prepared . One second into the robbery the third robber chickens out and runs away , leaving Sonny and Sal to do it on their own . The staff are jaded and cynical but politely put up with their bumbling and are only too happy to see the back of them . But the police surround the building at the last minute and a hostage situation suddenly arouses . With nowhere to go Sonny can only make the usual demands but the media circus outside makes him a nationwide star and the crowds outside cheer for him whenever he makes an appearance at the doors . I guess that in the 70's ( a decade I never witnessed ) public morale was so low that a failed bank robber could actually be a kind of hero for even attempting to stick it to the man . Based on a true story , the dialogue is mostly improvised , giving it a raw , realistic feel . Despite this , the script still won an Academy Award . A young Al Pacino seems to disappear and you end up seeing him only as Sonny . Why he never won the Oscar for Best Actor that year is beyond me . But I guess they thought that Jack Nicholson as McMurphy was more iconic / important / worthy or whatever . In fact , One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest took almost all the Oscar's DDA was nominated for . Having never seen that film , I can't really judge if it deserved them . It was also competing with Jaws for Best Picture that year . Man , 1975 sure was a good year for movies . Something that simply cannot be said for any year in the past decade . One my favorite actors ( Lance Henriksen , the man with the coolest voice in the world ) has a small role as one of the FBI Agents . I never spotted him for a while ( he's still quite young in this ) and he has very little dialogue , but it still a pivotal role . It's hard to define the genre that DDA fits into . On the one hand it's a hard-hitting real-life drama but on the other it's a satirical black comedy that's not without several moments of laugh-out-loud humor . Not a film for action junkies , I assume this is more for film buffs of students more than anyone else , but it's certainly an important film and it marks one of the many turning points in Pacino's never-ending career .

771,"Text1: "" Skirt is meat ! "" As the ' 60's progressed , a sea change took place in British film comedy . Norman Wisdom and St . Trinians were suddenly out-of-date ( though they kept on going for a few more years ) , and a new wave of Britcoms appeared , among them ' The Knack ' . Richard Lester had just made ' A Hard Days ' Night ' and brought the same mindset to this picture . Coming a year before Time magazine published its famous ' Swinging London ' article , it depicts a Britain on the cusp of a cultural and ( more importantly ) sexual revolution . As Spike Millgan later put it : "" Queen Victoria died in 1960 ! "" . It is arty ( shot in glorious black and white ) , sexist , often irritating , yet manages in its own way to say something serious about human relationships . Michael Crawford stars as ' Colin ' , a shy , repressed schoolteacher brassed off because his boarder , the good-looking ' Tolen ' ( Ray Brooks ) has a knack for ' pulling the birds ' . Tolen is the Russell Brand of his day ; girls are literally queueing outside his room at all times for sex . Tolen offers Colin a masterclass in the art of seduction . Tolen's attitude to the fairer sex is : "" I see , I want and I take "" , the sort of chauvinistic attitude probably responsible for Women's Lib in the first place . But even his powers are about to be tested to the limit when along comes Nancy ( Rita Tushingham ) a Northern lass newly arrived in London in search of lodgings . Nancy is immune to Tolen's ' Mr . Tight Trousers ' persona , and when he tries to get fresh with her she cries ' Rape ! ' . A number of reviewers have described the movie as ' dated ' . They are absolutely right . But it is fascinating for that reason alone . It is now a quaint museum piece , the sexual attitudes and mores of the era are on view and are fascinating . It may surprise some to learn that the play on which the film is based was written by a woman - Ann Jellicoe . Lester took the play and opened it out ( with help from screenwriter Charles Wood ) , turning it into a visual delight . Surrealism had finally joined the comedy mainstream . The jokes come at you so fast you need to be quick to pick them up . For instance , when Colin wonders whether to let his front room to a monk , we suddenly cut to a bus full of monks . When he gets angry and tries to keep Tolen out of the house by boarding up the front door , the film turns into a mini-lecture on carpentry . Throughout a Greek chorus of elderly people comment on events . "" I know what she's looking for and its not the Y . W . C . A . ! "" . Their remarks are much the same as you would hear nowadays . Being too old for sex themselves , they frown on the younger generation for being able to do it . Its these quirky flourishes that gives the film much of its charm . The famous scene where Colin , Nancy and Tom push a bed through the streets of London employs a style that was later used on ' The Monkees ' and ' The Goodies ' . The cast are excellent , in particular Donal Donnelly as an eccentric Irishman with a mad compulsion to paint everything white . Michael Crawford's ' Colin ' has all the naivety of his later ( better known ) role of ' Frank Spencer ' . Tushingham's innocent waif is appealing . As ' Tolen ' , all quiff and dark glasses , Ray Brooks is the epitome of ' 60's cool , a man who has women falling for him like dominoes . Watching this again recently , it occurred to me what a great vehicle for Peter Cook and Dudley Moore this would have made . The humour is broadly in line with what the duo were doing on ' Not Only But Also ' . You can easily imagine Cook as ' Tolen ' and Moore as ' Colin ' . Perhaps these characters inspired the ones they later played in ' Bedazzled ' . The film has its share of longueurs , however . Colin pretending to be a lion is something I think it could have done without .

One can see the military hardware and trained soldiers around remind one of the modern American Army , but that's about it ( as far as I can see ) . The treatment of the high schoolers and the burned out depressed state of Japan ( with the militarism ) can be a commentary on the collapse of capitalism or the rise of dictatorships , but the use of the name "" the East Asian Republic "" seems a dig at the old Imperialist Japanese dream of a "" Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere "" in the 1920s-1940s . But it is more modern - note the Japan after the economic crash is a Republic . BATORU ROWAIARU ( better known abroad as BATTLE ROYALE ) is about a future Japan that is a dictatorship , and is deadly afraid of the threat of youth . A law has been passed to run a yearly contest where a high school class is chosen by lottery . It's students are put on an island , and ordered ( by threat of death ) to fight each other to the death until either one or none are left . The threat of death is a real one . When their former teacher is telling them that this is serious , he has trouble with a female and a male student . He throws a knife into the female students skull , and demonstrates on the male student that the metal collars put on the students ' necks happens to be rigged to explode if they tamper with them or try to remove them . What happens , of course , is that the students soon are at each other's throats ( with a few notable exceptions ) . It somewhat reminiscent here of LORD OF THE FLIES , with warfare breaking out between two groups , but here it is everyone for themselves . Occasionally we see the teacher and the military at the high school headquarters on the island , but most of the time we don't see the adults ( with one exception ) . The three students who cooperate are Noriko , Shuya , and Kawada . Shuya was a friend of the student who was used to demonstrate the explosive qualities of those collars , and he feels guilty that he could not help his friend when he was screaming for assistance . Noriko was the girlfriend of the same fellow . The two end up promising to protect each other , and are eventually allied with Kawada , a survival expert who was one of two transfer students to their class . While other students try to cooperate , they meet with various degrees of fortune ( mostly bad ) . As for the adults , the only one we get to know is their teacher , who is an unsuccessful parent and a hateful teacher Kitano ( one of the male students stabs him at the start of the film , prior to the scene shifting to the island ) . The teacher happens to like Noriko , who is a sweet girl and reminds the teacher of the kind of child he would have liked to have had rather than what he does ( his own daughter tells him over the phone that his breath stinks even over the phone ) . To many people viewing the film it seems like a war between age groups ( vigorous , hopeful , democratic youth vs . fearful grown-ups ) . It is , but to see it only that way misses some points . The game or test is to purposely shatter the unanimity of the students , and it is not as hard as one would think . It has been said that the cruelest of human beings are children , and this film shows that is true . The girls have social cliques , and they constantly turn against outsiders . These frictions pop up in one-on-one confrontations , and also in a massive massacre sequence in a lighthouse , supposedly between girls who were friends . In the latter situation , when one of the more sensible girls tries to calm things down , one of her supposed friends tells her to knock off the leadership crap . As for the boys , a trio do work together to save as many as possible by some computer hacking and weapons building , but their

Text2: A Bit Better Than A Mere Curiosity I saw this film once on the American Movie Classics Channel ( about 1999 ) . Laurel & Hardy gained an international audience in the silent film period , mostly due to the physical nature of their comedy , but also because it being silent the dialog could be covered from one non-English speaking country to another with dialog cards that were in the language of that country . Along came the coming of sound and they faced the loss of most of their audience ( the idea of dubbing had not taken root yet ) . So Hal Roach and the boys constructed a number of films in the period from 1930 to 1931 that were in German , Spanish , and French . Not all of these films have survived - one in particular is sorely missed : the French version of PARDON US , in which the villain played by Walter Long is played by an up-and-coming performer named Boris Karloff . It was Karloff's only appearance with Stan and Ollie , and only a single still photo ( of him threatening them in the prison yard ) still exists . POLITIQUERIAS was the Spanish version of the short CHICKENS COME HOME , wherein Ollie is a successful businessman who is the reform candidate for Mayor . A shoe-in , he is unsettled by the discovery that a former girlfriend is threatening to reveal their relationship unless he pays her up . But she is trying to force him to see her that very night , when he is entertaining the reform leadership at his home . So he sends Stan to occupy her until he can visit himself . Naturally , Stan will screw up and she will show up at the Hardy mansion . The English version , that most fans are aware of , is about twenty five minutes long . But the Spanish version was quite a bit longer - almost a mini-feature film . In the English version Hardy's dinner party is taken for granted - he is the host who is trying to keep a good face before his biggest supporters , and in the face of increasing heat from his suspicious wife . On top of that his butler , Jimmy Finlayson , is blackmailing him continuously ( William Everson pointed out , in THE COMPLETE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY that while Finlayson is usually the social superior of the boys in their films , here , although he is a servant , he still getting the better of Ollie ) . Also , there are some cuts to Stanley's failure to control the other woman ( Mae Busch , of course ) , and how a friend of Mrs . Hardy ( a dried up old prude ) follows Stan and acts as a vindictive bolt of lightning on the boys . In this Spanish version Hardy's party takes center stage , with his hired entertainment acts being filler between the story line sequences . In particular there is the scenes with Hadji-Ali , the great regurgitator of the music halls and vaudeville houses of Europe and America . Oddly enough , a few years ago , in a special documentary about magicians and the like , the footage of Hadji-Ali from POLITIQUERIAS was used to demonstrate his remarkable act . He also teaches Jimmy Finlayson a lesson , when he uses him as an assistant in his act , and Jimmy gets soaked as a result . That the sound of that Scottish voice and that Georgian voice are now struggling with phonetically written Spanish is not a negative . Both do well enough , and it does not harm an English speaking audience , who would recall the English version . The film remains funny for the boys work and Finlayson , and one gets a rare opportunity to see a one time headliner who astounded audiences with his curious magic act .

Text2: Where does Championship Lie - in the Body or in the Head ? SWIMMING UPSTREAM is a brilliantly acted , deeply involving and ultimately uplifting film from Australia that deserves major audience exposure . Based on a true story of one of Australia's many championship athletes , this story is not merely another biopic ( although it was autobiographically written by Anthony Fingleton , the subject of the film ) : this is a story about large families of poverty , about the tragedies that befall families husbanded by an alcoholic abusive father , and about the ultimate triumph of the individual soul rising out of such conditions . Harold Fingleton ( Geoffrey Rush ) is a drunk , a blue collar worker who has sired five children by a strong but enabling wife Dora ( Judy Davis ) , a man whose focus on sports finds a possible escape from his joblessness when he discovers that his two middle sons Tony ( Jesse Spencer ) and the younger John ( Tim Draxl ) are able swimmers . For reasons unclear Harold focuses on John and while he relentlessly coaches both of the boys at the town pool every day , he decides John is going to be the champion swimmer in Australia . Tony excels in the backstroke and eventually surpasses his beloved brother John's times and proceeds to win the honors Harold expected of John . Throughout this tale of competition in swimming we are privy to the competition within the home . Harold , Jr ( David Hoflin ) is initially the bully yet gradually succumbs to his father's alcoholic lifestyle . Dora is beaten and abused yet is always there for her children , eking out a living and soothing the flare-up tantrums during Harold's drunken states . Tony and John cycle through periods of mutual adulation and the alternative fierce competition into which they are thrown by their father : their evolving bond is unforgettably touching . When Tony at last reaches the peak of his swimming potential , winning medals and applause form his countrymen , he still tries to grasp the love of a father whose is so consumed by his own demons that he is unable to acknowledge Tony's success . Tony's eventual choice of leaving Australia for either the Olympics or for a scholarship to Harvard in the USA provides some of the most touching moments between the various members of this long-suffering family . The direction by Russell Mulcahy is keenly paced , making excellent use of flashbacks to the significant moments in the family's history , and electing to use the split screen technique to underline the tension of the swimming meets while focusing on the faces of the family . As Tony , Jesse Spencer is both wonderful to watch ( he does his own swimming and he is a perfect physical specimen ! ) and reveals acting gifts that are usually those of more seasoned performers . Indeed , Rush , Davis and Draxl also give spellbinding performances that are born of nuance and understatement . In a family where there could be polarization of response from the audience , each of the actors is so fine that we are able to find the complete personas of these disparate people and find warmth and understanding for all of them . One wonders why this film was not heralded in the theatrical release , as it is one of the finer movies to come out in years . Both Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis give outstanding , award deserving performances . The DVD includes all of the ' deleted scenes ' and it is highly recommended to view these important inexplicably cut moments as they truly enhance the film . Very Highly Recommended ! Grady Harp

775,"Text1: Dated , atmospheric shocker still inspires Gruesome and not all together accurate , depiction of the Old Pagan Ways , but beautiful in some ways , nonetheless . As a Pagan , I must say that I was not surprised to find that Pagans were depicted as the villains here . Such is the way of man , to fear what he does not understand , and to seek to destroy that which he fears . Other than that one gripe , I found the whole human sacrifice ploy to be indicative of the condition about which I first spoke . All religions of old practiced human sacrifice at one time or another , including the religion of choice of mainstream America ; Christianity . I found it a convenient and contrived device to use here , after such beauty was displayed . But perhaps that was the intent of the director ; to lull us with the wonders of Pagan revelry and then murder that lulled sense of placation with the horrors that follow . Whichever the case , it worked . This movie is a beautiful glimpse into the world which was , and then you are plunged into the darker side of that same world . As Satanists / Luciferians are considered to be a Christian heresy , so is the type of rite featured at the end of this movie , to the Pagan community at large . The burning of the "" stuffy guy , "" "" corn man , "" "" wicker man , "" or "" John Barleycorn "" is a beautiful and sacred tradition among many in the Pagan fold , as there are as many denominations of Paganism as there are in Christianity . The corn man was filled with animals raised as sacrament to the God of the Hunt . Fresh fruits and grains ( the best of the previous year's harvest ) were placed into the corn man's extremities , he was erected and burned as a burnt offering to the Goddess as a wedding present . She marries the God on Beltane , or May Day if you prefer . Macy's still has a beautiful May Day parade , and many schools still celebrate May Day with festivals ; some still featuring the May Pole . Just as there are fall festivals , there are still spring festivals the world over . Most do not remember why , but some of us do . I found the duplicity of this particular group of Pagans to be delightfully dark and highly enjoyable ; sneaky , underhanded and just wrong , but enjoyable to watch . But if you are not of the Pagan Folds , never fear . This movie does not glamorize Paganism . To the contrary , it drags us back to the Dark Ages when human sacrifice was an acceptable means of offering , and human life was not yet considered sacred . So it will sit well with your fine sensibilities and not compromise your self-righteous indignations . Watch it for yourself to witness one of the most beautifully dark movies to ever be committed to film . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

The premise behind this film is simple and the sub plots are uncomplicated and sometimes trite , but the movie is consistently contrived , from beginning to end .

Complications ensue . Well , duh ! The suspension of belief required is pretty hard to achieve . In fact , it was impossible to achieve such an extreme level of dim awareness . The only redeeming element associated with this work is John Malkovich's performance , which is startling and Michael Jacksonesque ( though not so much so as Depp's Chocolate Factory persona ) .

Text2: Beautiful atmospheric suspense behind a darkly Machiavellian story Quite honestly , at first , I did not know what to make of this film . Upon first viewing , it seemed like an overly-long , over-dramatized , superficial piece of cinematic sludge . However , upon a second viewing , I've come to appreciate the fiendish wit , and slow building suspense which is comparable to the malevolent Hitchcock-ian style suspense fans will quickly recognize . However , it does lack the subtlety of said director's style but gives you in-your-face evil in its place . These performances are really quite indicative of America's New England accents , mind-sets , and coastal way of life . Everyone contributed above-average performances , so there is no need to single out anyone other than Colm Feore . Colm Feore takes on the character of Andre Linoge ; the personification of evil itself . As a Being of great power and extreme longevity , his quest for a prodigy is actually quite understandable . However , the way he goes about it , was psychologically sound in execution , and provides him the very end he desired . He divided . He terrorized . He manifested . He planted the seeds of apathy , and he conquered . Very cleverly written and portrayed with a marvelously Machiavellian execution . You never even notice that it was actually , Made for TV . There was one issue , I had with this film . You never discover what Linoge's race is . You are told he is neither a God , nor an Immortal . He has Vampyric teeth , and lives a long , long time , but he is obviously not a Vampyre . He demonstrates some of the elder Vampyric abilities , but I got the feeling there was much more there than mere Vampyrism . It would have been nice to have been told . I must also add that the DVD version contained about 30 minutes ' worth of snips of scenes which the 2-tape VHS edition I had for years did not possess .

Because I want to discuss the short in a little detail , there will be spoilers : The basic premise is that people who work on the clock at a supermarket during the late shift all have different ways to make the time seem to go by more quickly , ranging from just not looking at the clock through simply goofing off to the most extreme , which is pretending that you've cause time and all movement but your own to come to a full stop . Along the way , we meet a female checkout clerk , the overbearing and absolutely tedious supervisor who keeps trying to impress her ( in vain ) , two arrested development cases , who are 22 going on 12 and the narrator , who is the one who makes time pass by acting like he's stopped it cold . Oh yeah-he also likes to sketch the female shoppers ( at least the prettier ones ) in the nude . His narration is generally entertaining and often funny . It's an entertaining short which may actually make a better feature , as it feels a tad constrained by its brevity . All in all , a good short and well worth watching . This short is available on a compilation DVD containing eight of ten nominees for the two Academy Awards Shorts categories ( two of the Animated Short nominees aren't included ) and it's a very good DVD indeed .

Recreating the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC , it is the simple story of King Leonidas ( Gerard Butler ) rallying 300 of his finest red-caped warriors from Sparta , all taught from childhood to have no fear and fight against the forces of the massive Persian army . The enemy includes men , immortals and creatures , all belonging to giant King Xerxes ( Love Actually's Rodrigo Santoro ) . Dilios ( The Lord of the Rings ' David Wenham ) is the one warrior who delivers the news to awaiting Queen Gorgo ( Lena Headey ) , even the ( for me ) unexpected ending . Also starring Dominic West as Theron , Vincent Regan as Captain , Michael Fassbender as Stelios and Tom Wisdom as Astinos . The special effects are marvellous ( especially the hunchback character ) , the sets , light and colour are lavish , and the use of bloody violence ( including many be-headings ) is fantastic , it could have been an 18 if you saw some guts and the blood spill on the floor .

Fortunately , they not only wore them , they made wearing them look good . More of the trademarks are added , probably the very last of them . . . ironically , this was originally supposed to be the last in the series . Fortunately , it was such a huge success that more were produced . We finally get Ove Verner Hansen as B√∏ffen , the part he was born to play . . . a Mafia-esquire hit-man who takes great pleasure in his work . Coupled with Bj√∏rn Watt-Boolsen as the thoroughly capitalistic and only somewhat criminal business-man , we have the recipe for a delightful piece of Danish comedy with the Gang .

The pacing is flawless . I wasn't bored for one moment , even knowing most of what was coming . In addition to the aforementioned two recurring characters , Ole Ernst finally takes over as the younger police official , portraying a cowboy-ish , eager young detective . He compliments Axel Str√∏bye's dry , experienced , fed-up and realistic / pessimistic investigator perfectly . This and the next one are the only two that start in the Gang's dream destination . . .

Text2: Not even particularly good for a B-movie From the very first frame of this film to the very last , it's completely obvious that it's a B-movie . A modern , low-budget , direct-to-video no less , action-B-movie . As a follow-up to the first , it's very bad . It turns the plot and theme of the first completely around . The plot is lame , and very unoriginal . The acting is horrible ; there were times when it felt like a comedy , or a parody of the first . The characters are badly written cliches , derived from war movies and other B-movies . The cinematography is amateurish and lesser than that of the typical level of early film-student test film ( believe me , it really is that bad ) . The director ( or possibly the director of photography , or maybe the cameramen ) seems to have a fetish for pointless and very quick zooming shots , and there seems to be quite a lot of camera angles that are zoomed much too far in . I also hated a few of the pan shots , but there were not as many as the zoom shots , and they were somewhat far between . The special effects are quite awful , though there were one or two effects that looked decent . The heroism and stereotyping of the main character / hero is ludicrous . I couldn't stop laughing at the scenes where he tries to look heroic . The whole film is quite laughable . The attempts at humor are cringe-worthy , and almost every scene that is supposed to inspire fear , tension or horror , inspired laughter and mockery instead . The dialog is ridiculous , and very badly written . The action is tame and never really intense . The horror elements are derivative of several much better movies , and generally don't work like they're supposed to , for various reasons ( bad special effects , bad acting , bad camera angle ) . I know that this was direct-to-video , low-budget , and was possibly even intended as a B-movie , but come on , you can do better than this . Almost anyone could . I would guess that , given the same budget ( about six million dollars , I think ) , I could have supplied a better , more interesting 90 minute flick . None of the limitations can be used to excuse how bad the film is . Direct-to-video ? Please . So was Children of the Corn IV and American Psycho 2 , and at least they were somewhat entertaining and much more professionally made . Low budget ? Two words : El Mariachi . B-movie ? Honestly . . . there are plenty of much more entertaining B-movies out there . Take Barb Wire , for example . All in all , a pretty bad film , but fans of B-movies might enjoy it . I recommend this only to fans of B-movies , and people who wished the first had been more like a B-movie . Fans of the first should stay away . I don't regret watching this , though . It was good for a laugh , and knowing that it's so bad is better than wondering about it . If you somehow , as a fan of the first , see this movie , try to think of it as comic relief , a spoof of the first . It'll soften the blow .

Apparently , snuff is porn that suddenly turns into a real-life killing , right there , in front of the camera . I don't know if these films exist for real , but I know that they are rumored to be real enough . The movie deals with these sick films , or , rather , one film in particular . A widow finds a snuff film in the safe of her dead husband , and so she hires a private investigator to find out about whether or not the killing is real . The P . I .

The plot is fairly good , but it moves along at a very bad pace . Almost the entire second half is dedicated to the P . I . flipping out after having seen too much , and it just seems like the director wanted to milk this theme for all it was worth . The acting is mostly good . The characters are , with the exception of the main characters and one or two supporting characters , badly written cliches . Though I did think the overall theme was pretty good , the execution was very bad ; they really wasted some good potential there . I recommend this only to big fans of the mystery / thriller genre , or to people who the theme appeals to .

783,"Text1: Twenty years after the first manned moon landing , there came the best documentary about Apollo , and by extension , the space program that I've ever seen ! Nothing I can say could possibly do this documentary justice , but I'm going to try anyway . One of the greatest ( in more than one sense ) and most profound of human endeavors that has ever been undertaken is the effort at spaceflight . The most notable achievement is the landing and return of humans to the Moon . This documentary recaptures the awe and wonder I felt ( and still feel today ) when I watched the landing . Nominated for Documentary Feature , it should have won ( or at least tied ) . As good as Common Threads was and is , for For All Mankind not to have won says more about the Academy and present-day society's fixation on now and its indifference to both yesterday and tomorrow . In a disposable society where creativity is less honored than timliness and for whom all too many , the past is what they had for breakfast , twenty years may as well be two thousand . Sic Transit Gloria ( Thus Passeth Glory ) . Most , most highly RECOMMENDED ! ! !


Text2: How Courage the Cowardly Dog started This short was made for the Cartoon Network as a part of their Cartoon Cartoon series , aired in theaters and was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Short . The rules have been changed to preclude nominees from being part of a series or conceived originally for television from being eligible . I personally think this is an excellent short and while I understand the logic behind the rules change , I consider it a shame nonetheless . The success of this short led to a series called Courage the Cowardly Dog , one of the better series in a line-up of series that is widely variable as to quality ( some of it quite good , all too much of it poor indeed ) and is well worth watching . Cartoon Network still shows it occasionally . Recommended .

Text2: Gem of All Gems This 1943 Classic film clearly showed how Hollywood supported our Armed Forces during World War II and there are so many talented actors appearing in this film who all gave great performances with their talented gifts . Always enjoyed the great singing talent of Lena Horne who appeared in many Musicals during the 1940's and one of her famous songs was "" Stormy Weather "" . I use to live in St . Albans , Queens , New York and she was a neighbor . Lena was the pioneer of Black entertainers who started to break into the Hollywood scene and finally it was accomplished . Naturally , the War was going on and this was a picture that was created to cheer our Fighting Men and it also was a propaganda film to cheer up the American Citizens with a cast of hundreds of famous actors . Enjoyed seeing a very little known actress who is now 91 years of age , Marsha Hunt who was very young and attractive in the film , she was only 26 years of age . Don't miss this film , it is really a gem of a gem . Enjoy

In fact , despite Ed Wood , Jr . and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity , this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood . Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics ( such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER ) , but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's ! However , bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing . Like a Wood film , it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends . The film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet . However , out of nowhere , a UFO streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the Air Force . However , later , they realized that the UFO didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut ! But , when soon after this planes start disappearing all over , they realize there must be something to his sighting . So far , the film isn't great but it's watchable . However , by the time the horrible flying monster appears , you know you're watching a turkey . First , through horrid use of stock film and crappy models , airplanes keep changing mid-flight . Some may not be bothered by this , but with airplane lovers like me , seeing an F-80 turning into an F-86 to an F-102 fighter plane made me crazy - - especially since the planes look nothing like each other . Second , through "" clever "" cinematography , all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film ! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly , it will be worth the wait . Well , no such luck ! ! The "" monster "" looks less realistic or scary than the duck from Groucho's "" You Bet Your Life "" TV show ! ! In fact , it's significantly less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters ! ! In fact , Big Bird from "" Sesame Street "" is even a bit scarier and realistic ! ! ! It's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history - - about as bad ( or worse ) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE ! ! ! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like . Bad film fans like me ( who are a crazy bunch ) will probably love it ! All others . . . be afraid , . . . . be VERY afraid ! ! FYI - - You might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies ! !

Text2: See the world's oldest teenagers battle a monster from space ! ! This is a very famous 50s sci-fi film that was indifferently remade in the 1980s . It stars Steven McQueen ( age 28 ) and Aneta Corsaut ( 25 ) as teenagers ( ! ) who discover a strange blob-like thing from outer space . However , when they go to the police , the cops mostly think it's all a teenage prank and there is no obvious evidence that the monster has already eaten the doctor and his assistant . While McQueen and Corsaut ( who played "" Helen "" on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW ) did fine jobs acting , they looked nothing like real teenagers and it make me smile every time the panic was being blamed on "" those crazy kids "" ! This is a very simple story idea and has been repeated many times - - an alien lands and the "" kids "" see it but no one believes them , such as in INVASION OF THE SAUCER MEN . However , this low-budget film worked better than most because somehow everything worked well - - the monster was simple but effective , the acting better than usual and somehow they had enough money to afford to actually film it in color . A very effective and fun film - - though one that fuddy-duddies and ultra-serious people should avoid . By the way , the title song is very , very catchy and goofy and was written by Burt Bacharach . I heard it for the first time at the Sci-Fi Dine-In restaurant at the Disney-Hollywood Studios in Orlando , Florida . At this amazingly cool retro restaurant , you sit in fake 50s cars with tables and these "" cars "" all face a giant screen on which old fashioned sci-fi clips are shown . Among the many clips and cartoons is a music video of sorts featuring this catchy song . If you ever get to the park , try this place . The food it okay but the atmosphere is amazing and perfect for people who love this genre . Also , this film was part of a double-feature with another great 50s sci-fi film ( and one of my favorites ) I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE . What a terrific double-billing !

Text2: The four seasons Based on the opera's libretto , the screenplay suffers for it : as it is not sung , except for one song , the story is sometimes hard to follow , although it's very slow ; for instance , in the opera , Rodolfo ( Rodolphe ) sings his pain when he learns that Mimi is terminally-ill : here he tells it to his friends much to the audience's surprise ( for they hardly heard Mimi cough once before , and that's it ) . It was reportedly based on the novel which inspired the opera but the narration is not really satisfying anyway . The story is divided into four parts : the four seasons , from Spring to Winter . Spring introduces the characters : all are artists ( painters , musicians , poets . . . ) , all are bound for glory , these are the salad days , the youth . C'est La Vie de Boh√™me , the bohemian life . The best scene shows Mimi and Rodolphe in Les Jardins Du Luxembourg , the happiest part of their relationship . Summer brings the Revolution , probably the 1848 one , although the movie remains extremely vague for that matter . Rodolphe , the poet , is very disappointed cause nobody wants to publish his lines . Autumn ( Fall ) is the beginning of the bad days . The pals have nothing to burn in their fireplace "" except themselves "" . Mimi has left Rodolphe for she does not want to be a burden for him . Winter : as the snow flies , the friends celebrate Christmas ; Mimi has become a supported woman ; she's dying and she's still in love with Rodolphe . Louis Jourdan , the most handsome French actor of the era , is the stand-out ; Maria Denis who plays Mimi was nearing 30 at the time and was already too old for her part .

787,"Text1: Crash and burn You know those movies that really don't need sequels ? Can you tell the Hollywood producers about that ? Abrahams and the two Zuckers , or ZAZ , agreed not to do this . Thus , they abandoned this , and evidently took almost all of the hilarity with them , whether or not they intended to do so . That left this with some pieces of comedy , but mostly what there is just hacks , coughs , sputters and dies slowly and painfully before the viewers ' eyes . It's not a pretty sight . This is a soulless , less "" honest "" spoof . There is arguably more objectionable content in the first five minutes of this than the entirety of its predecessor . The bits that are , at times directly , lifted from it tend to do little other than highlight how little this one has on the one that came before it . Several cast-members return , including the two leads , however , the script they were given leaves them powerless to save this . Even Shat doesn't quite save it ( and he certainly does try , and does well with what he had to work with ) . It would be too harsh and critical , if not by particularly much , to claim that none of this is funny at all ( heck , when at its best , which is extremely seldom , it isn't without outright hilarity ) . It's pretty half-hearted , and comes off as being made for the bucks , not the laughs . The fact remains that it offers next to nothing , and certainly not a thing that comes even remotely close to being worth possibly risking messing up the memory of Airplane ! , if one fears an inclination towards that . There's a lot more sexuality ( and usually the gags and jokes go on for so long , it ceases to even hold potential for humor . . . and reach the level of being gratuitous ) , other offensive material ( except for drug references ) and language in this . The end credits featuring the as-of-yet-unfulfilled promise of a third entry is really a perfect testament to the failure of this . Perhaps it can at least help deter follow-ups that are useless and uncalled for from being released . It certainly isn't alone . Lastly , let me point out that this is not merely a case of a sequel being a letdown . . . it's simply not a good film . I recommend this to those who must have both in the series .


Text2: You really think you can trust the person at your side ? This is a serious injection of pure paranoia . If you don't get anxious and ask important questions about what exactly happens that we don't get to see , and when , during the course of this , then you , my friend , were not properly engaged , and , let's be brutally honest here , this film probably wasn't meant for you ( and hey , that's no problem , nothing is for everyone ) . A lot of debate is possible over the answers . And that's part of why this is so enormously terrifying , and what keeps this working for the audience , even with many viewings . It's difficult to be certain . The plot is marvelous , and its progression feels natural without being predictable . The concept is well-thought out , interesting and fascinating , and the execution does not disappoint . The pacing is spot-on , there is not a misplaced moment to be found in this . When this intends to be , it is rather intense . The atmosphere is expertly crafted , and builds at the proper speed , never rushed . The tension is so thick you can practically see it . The gore is plentiful , and while quite frightening , it isn't the point , nor does it ever feel like it is . And whether you like them or not , ya gotta admit , they look pretty darn good for when they were made . All the special effects in this do , almost entirely on account of Rob Bottin , the newcomer who literally exhausted himself creating them . The key is the balance , how far you push the shocks , and John's got that down to a science . The humor is of the same type and close to the same amount as his usual efforts . The acting is average or above . The characters are sufficiently developed and varied . The dialog is well-delivered and well-written . The mood is helped by the brilliant composer Ennio Morricone , who applies his talent , and puts together music that fits Carpenter perfectly . If your nerves are not in tattered rags before this is over . . . see the beginning of this review . All of these things together . . . the isolation of the people and the setting , the long , claustrophobic hallways , the genuinely successful scares , the gruesome violence and the haunting , unsettling score . . . it creates a strong horror piece which still holds up today , and which manages to get jumps out of yours truly , after having watched it around a dozen times . The DVD holds a feature-length behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track with Kurt Russell and the director , who are cool to listen to together , and which is both entertaining and informative . The menus are a tad flat , and one can tell that the release was done years after this hit theaters . I recommend this movie to fans of all that were involved in making it . . . in particular the man who helmed it .

790,"Text1: little of the Laurel and Hardy magic While this isn't a bad film , it certainly isn't one of the team's better efforts . It's a shame really , as 1929 to the mid 30s was the absolute prime period of their work together . I guess considering all the great films they made , it's okay to have a bit of a let-down , . . . and that's exactly what this is . The routines are not especially funny and the same type things had been done before by them with better results . Stan and Ollie are a Vaudeville team catching a train to their next gig . They have trouble locating each other at the station and Ollie loses his papers from his suitcase in this opening scene - - not terribly funny stuff at all . Then , on the train , two main comedy bits are used . The first involves people grabbing and ripping each other's clothes . This has been done before and the set up for this wasn't very smooth or believable - - people just start doing it for apparently no reason at all . Next , Stan and Ollie must both climb into an upper sleeping berth designed for one . This seems to take forever and is frankly stretched too long . Really , now that I think about it , this movie was a pleasant enough short but really had no laughs . PS - - you can tell , in spots , that this film was originally a silent film or that they were unfamiliar with making sound films , as the sound is absent in some of the early scenes or seem tacked on . This isn't as bad or noticeable as in many early sound films , but if you look you'll notice .


Text2: The earliest Laurel and Hardy film that actually looks like a Laurel and Hardy film Stan and Ollie had already appeared in a couple films together before this one but their interactions bore no resemblance to them being a team . DUCK SOUP is the first where they pretty much play the usual Stan and Ollie characters , though with some small differences ( such as Ollie wearing a top hat and the characters not using their real names ) . This style was actually a bit of an accident , as following this film they made quite a few films in 1927 in which the team really wasn't a team and played very different style parts ( such as in SLIPPING WIVES and WHY GIRLS LOVE SAILORS ) . The film begins with news that because local forest fires are so bad , hobos are being drafted by the forest rangers to battle the fire . Stan and Ollie are happy and lazy and want nothing to do with work - - particularly of the dangerous variety . So they escape from the press gang and eventually hide out in a mansion that is vacant . However , soon some people arrive who intend to rent the place and the boys pretend to be the owner ( Ollie plays "" the Colonel "" ) and his maid ( Stan ) . Seeing Stan in drag was pretty cute and was something he did in several early films . Naturally , the REAL Colonel arrives and finds that Ollie is packing what he can steal from the home . In slapstick tradition that means one thing - - the Colonel will begin shooting wildly as the boys and the innocent renters scramble for their lives . Eventually , the forest rangers catch the boys and force them to work - - leading to a very "" forced "" ending . While this film is funny and worth watching for Laurel and Hardy fans , the chemistry just isn't there and the film isn't any better than any other Hal Roach short of the day . Worth seeing but far from a must-see unless you are a nut like myself who wants to see every Laurel and Hardy film ever made ( minus the lost ones such as HATS OFF and ROGUE SONG ) . FYI - - When the movie begins , you may notice that a tiny bit of it is missing and the print is , in places , poor . Unfortunately , this seems to be all that remains of this film due to the degradation of the nitrate stock .

Text2: Follows the formula , but at least does it with style and creativity . Contains spoiler The first thing I heard about The Italian Job was that it had a car chase in it that was supposed to be better than the one in The Matrix Reloaded . I'm not sure I would go that far , but there is no denying that there is some great action in this movie . It is , admittedly , an hour and forty minute Mini Cooper commercial , and it definitely follows the typical formula of a heist movie , but there are subtle differences that make it more than worth watching . Seth Green plays the part of Lyle , who I'll just describe as exactly the same character that he played in Enemy of the State to save time , but he provides some of the most entertaining scenes in the film . The creation of the ' Los Angeles ' largest traffic jam ever ' ( although I'm SURE I've been stuck in worse than that in that place ) is the movies main attraction , and Lyle creates it with suck geeky style that he makes it cool to be a computer nerd again . ( spoilers ) Charlize Theron plays Stella Bridger , the daughter of John Bridger ( Donald Sutherland ) , whose vicious murder provides much of the drive for the conflict of the entire film . Stella plays the beautiful blonde with a whole world of possibilities open to her because she's so intelligent and strong , and then she is sent into an emotional turmoil for most of the film . So basically exactly the same character she played in The Devil's Advocate , Reindeer Games , The Astronaut's Wife , Mighty Joe Young , The Legend of Bagger Vance , Men of Honor , 15 Minutes , etc . Donald Sutherland is , of course , his usual badass self , with a calm and collected cool that is rivaled only by such greats as Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood . He is an actor who naturally portrays characters who have plans that go just a little beyond what is spoken aloud ( except , of course , for the character he played in Backdraft ) . In a movie that's populated almost entirely by stereotyped characters , it's nice that at least one of the caricatures is not routine and boring . Mark Wahlberg is another caricature , but he is also not boring just because it's so much fun to watch him be ped off and seeking revenge . I've always thought that he had a tiny bit of a hard time playing anything other than a former-musician-turned-actor , but he definitely has his own style which fits perfectly with his role in The Italian Job . And then there is Edward Norton , one of today's few young actors who promises to ultimately obtain as much skill in portraying diverse characters as people like Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman , who are so good at what they do that they can literally play any role in the world should the need arise . One of the only things that I was a little apprehensive about when I went to see The Italian Job was that I knew Norton was going to play the bad guy , and I have always been so staggered by his performances in movies like Primal Fear and American History X that I was a little bummed that I would have to watch him caught and probably killed in this movie ( thankfully I was spared the latter , which is more than can be said of movies in similar situations , like Training Day ) . Despite my opinion that Edward Norton's role as the bad guy was initially a little disappointing to me , it also turned out to be one of the best parts of the movie , and not only because Norton is such a spectacularly talented actor , some credit also goes to the writers in this category . As a whole , The Italian Job doesn't stray too far from the typical heist movie formula , but the thing that really makes it interesting as we're led to the ending that we always knew we would see is that the villain , Norton , is not a complete moron , as villains quite often are .

Edward de Souza ( Gerald Harcourt ) , "" Jane Eyre "" , ' 96 seeks the assistance of Dr . Davna . There are lots of BATS flying around and the bride even spits in the grooms face . This is a worth while film to view , it is different than most Vampire films and is good entertainment !

Whilst I found it less than riveting it did keep me watching and I was able to wallow in Caroline Keener's fantastic support as Harper Lee . Hoffman is just as brilliant in the eponymous role as everyone said he was yet nevertheless it was difficult to become engrossed in the story and I found myself wondering why - when a caption announces the time as November , 1956 , the leaves on the trees are not being stirred by a wind whilst Capote and Lee are definitely dressed for winter , which is hardly the sign of a gripping movie . In my case I was equally , if not more so , interested in William Shawn and Harper Lee as they figured in Capote's life as the two killers . Like I said interesting but not memorable .

When you make a film with a killer-kids premise , there are two effective ways to approach it ; you can either make it as realistic as possible , creating believable characters and situations , or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs ( something which the makers of "" Silent Night , Deadly Night "" did , for example , on an equally controversial subject : a killer Santa ) . The people who made "" Bloody Birthday "" , however , do neither of those things ; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun ( or a knife , or a noose , or an arrow ) in his / her hand .

800,"Text1: We All Live In A Pink Submarine In Tony Curtis's filmed tribute to Cary Grant for TCM he made much of his well known idolatry of the man who made him want to become an actor . As a kid growing up in the mean streets of New York , young Bernie Schwartz saw in Cary Grant all he ever wanted to be up there on the silver screen . During naval service on board a submarine in World War II he got to see Cary Grant in Warner Brothers Destination Tokyo . As Curtis said , life has a funny way of working things out . What happens ; Tony Curtis gets to star with Grant years later in a World War II service comedy that is set aboard a submarine . Destination Tokyo was not one of Grant's best films , but Operation Petticoat definitely is . Right after World War II starts , Grant's new ship , the Tigerfish is sunk right in her berth in a remote Pacific Island . Grant persuades Admiral Robert Simon to make whatever repairs he can and try and get the ship back to Pearl Harbor for repairs . Among other things Grant gets is a new officer Tony Curtis who hasn't exactly seen much sea duty , but he's quite the operator . The two develop quite an interesting relationship on the voyage . And it's one thing after another on that memorable shakedown cruise back to Pearl Harbor . But Cary Grant is as unflappable and charming as ever , though even he seems a bit put out at times . There are some pretty hilarious moments in Operation Petticoat , the sinking of a truck , the painting of the Tigerfish pink and then having to leave it that way until Pearl Harbor . And who can forget how they are saved from friendly fire at the climax of the film . Operation Petticoat was one of the biggest commercial and critical hits that Cary Grant had in Hollywood . Coming right after North By Northwest it could well be argued this was the high point of his career . The film holds up very well today , I think today's audience would laugh just as hard as they did in 1959 .


Text2: A Knave Certainly , A Traitor Very Likely Concealed Enemies is a fine PBS docudrama about the Alger Hiss case and the first nationwide notice of a freshman Republican Congressman from California named Richard M . Nixon . Had it not been for the Hiss case and the surrounding publicity , Nixon said himself he probably would never have run for president . He might very well have remained one of many obscure members of Congress who history has forgotten . On the other hand , knowing Nixon if the Hiss case had never happened , he would have found another way to rise . If there was a poster boy for the New Deal it was Alger Hiss who served throughout the Roosevelt Administration in various capacities in the Agriculture , Justice , and State Department . By 1945 he was part of the delegation with FDR at Yalta , he was also part of the American delegation at the opening of the United Nations which he work0ed to found . When accusations from Whittaker Chambers came about his being a Communist , Hiss had been chosen as President of the Carnegie Endowment for World Peace . Chambers was an editor at Time Magazine who made the accusation in testimony before the House Un American Activities Committee of which Nixon was a member . He was not judged to be a creditable witness , changing parts of his story several times . When Hiss appeared he did not claim the Fifth Amendment which he could have , but issued a firm denial that he was not a Communist and in fact never even knew this Chambers person despite the fact that Chambers claimed they were in the same Communist cell and the families were social with each other . And that's where he made his big mistake because whether Hiss was a spy or not and he still has his supporters on that question , he plain out lied in saying he never knew Chambers . One ' I don't recall ' or ' my memory is vague ' and he would have been home free . It was established beyond question that Chambers knew him back in the day . That was the perjury that he was convicted on after two trials . Chambers is played by a profusely sweating John Harkins capturing the real Chambers as he gave his testimony at HUAC . You can see why Chambers was not considered a creditable witness . The contrast is Alger Hiss striped pants and all played by a confident Edward Herrman . Looking every inch the elegant diplomat , he defended himself with a clarity and sincerity that no doubt served him well in negotiations . The problem is he overdid and did himself in . The one member on the committee who did believe Chambers after a while was Peter Riegert as young Nixon . Oddly enough both Nixon and Hiss came from poor backgrounds , Hiss lost a father , brother , and sister , Nixon lost two brothers as kids . Both were bright kids who won scholarships in academics . And yet they went opposite directions politically and if you believe it , Alger Hiss went a lot further to the left than he dare admit . Riegert is great as Nixon , you can see the genesis of the people who Anthony Hopkins and Frank Langella later played in their maturity . Hopefully PBS will either show this film again or get it out on DVD and / or VHS and soon .

"" Peyton Place "" is a static adaptation of a scandalous book , filled with a cast of females who all look the same - - as blonde and coiffed as the most stereotypical image of a 50s housewife . Of them , Hope Lange does the best with the material given her , playing a sweet kid with a lousy dad , who rapes and beats her in glorious Technicolor . Arthur Kennedy growls his way through the movie as said dad , providing it with some much-needed testosterone , even if that testosterone is somewhat misdirected . Also technically providing some male hormones to the film , though in much diluted form , is Russ Tamblyn , who plays a shy nerd smitten with the movie's narrator , played by Diane Varsi . And bringing the film its star voltage , Lana Turner delivers an imperious performance as an uptight mom , all pointy breasts and platinum blonde hair . "" Peyton Place "" supposedly takes place in the early 1940s , but you'd never know it from the film's production design .

Text2: I saw this film when I was young , and its not that scary now If you remember back in the early 80's the Canadian government gave tax breaks to create a film industry , up here . These early films where usually low budget horror or teen party comedies or varations of these types of films spliced together , with interesting scripts that need another rewrite , choppy acting , grainy film quality , a big name lead actor with a no name cast , and a generic way of directing that makes one film look and feel like the next one . When I see a HBO film or show I can tell if its made in Canada in the first few minuties by watching the directing . In the end the tax breaks payed off with a well developed film industry , and a legacy of these horrible Canadian stinkers .

802,"Text1: Excellent and potent tale of loss Paris , Texas is my first ever taste of acclaimed director Wim Wenders , and while the film isn't exactly sweet ; it's certainly not bitter enough to steer itself away from the realms of the masterpiece . Paris , Texas is very much a character driven story and it follows the account of a man that wanders out of the hot desert sun with an acute case of amnesia . When his brother , Walt , finds him , he helps him to remember his life , and we then watch as our protagonist rekindles his former relationships first with son , and then with the mother of his child . Wim Wenders handles this story with the utmost skill , and it works thanks to the tentative way that he portrays the characters to the audience . Just like the town of it's title ; Paris , Texas is basically a film about being lost . I ( and I'm sure many other people ) didn't even realise that there was a place called Paris in the middle of Texas , and this little place is symbolic of the substance that is at the core of this movie . The film doesn't benefit from any big name actors , but the actors in the movie do give it their all and ensure that it doesn't fall down on the acting side . Harry Dean Stanton takes the lead role , and does a good job in , at first , portraying a man consumed with amnesia ; and then consumed with the time he has lost . Nastassja Kinski is the only member of the cast that has a really notable list of film credits other than this movie , but ironically she has the least screen time of the five leads . Every minute she is on screen is a delight , however , and she lights up the screen with both of her talents ; looks and acting ability . The young Hunter Carson gives a rare child performance ; i . e . one that isn't incredibly annoying , but strangely he didn't appear in very many movies after this one . The climax to the tale is more than satisfying , and is easily one of the most haunting and potent I've ever seen in a film . Wenders shows his talent with both the execution and the implications of it , and it's a satisfying end to a very satisfying movie . Recommended .


Text2: Murder on the Chicago to L . A . Express The novelty of this Richard Fleischer-directed crime thriller rests on the fact that nearly the entire film takes place on board a train . Fleischer , who was adept at slicking up pulpy B material and giving it style to spare , treats the cramped shooting spaces as an advantage rather than a liability - - he uses extreme closeups , packed compositions and clever reflections ( in train windows , mirrors , etc . ) to enhance the story's claustrophobic appeal . No where is this more apparent than in a wild fist fight that takes place in a tiny mens ' room . The story surrounds a hard-boiled detective's ( Charles McGraw , who looks like he was born to play leading men in B noirs ) efforts to escort a dead mobster's wife to L . A . so that she can testify in front of a grand jury . The bad guys want to bump her off before she gets there , but they don't know what she looks like . McGraw delivers the tough-guy patter with confidence , and Marie Windsor ( who reminded me a bit of the contemporary actress Illeana Douglas ) swaggers her way through the role of a gangster's moll with flair . When McGraw tells her at one point that her amorality makes him sick , she replies , "" Use somebody else's sink . "" A plot twist toward the film's end caught me completely off guard .

But either way , everyone should be able to recognize themselves in the actions Paul Kersey takes . Even though its ruthless and violent , you still understand him and cheer for him as well . It distinct this movie from other ' revenge-flicks ' and is the very reason why this movie has grown a bit into a Charles Bronson classic . I like how the movie handles its story . It doesn't try to glorify Paul Kersey's actions but it does make them understandable . Yes , the violence is pretty brutal but it all serves a purpose in the movie and becomes necessary for the forming of the character . Basically this movie is just your average action movie revenge flick but with more realism added to it . It helps to make "" Death Wish "" an original movie , even though the story and concept itself is far from anything new or original . The story is slowly told and it takes its time to develop . The movie is perhaps even an essential ' 70's viewing , since its a one of a kind movie , in which a normal every day guy turn into a ' sidewalk vigilante ' after his wife is killed and his daughter raped by a couple of thugs ( one of them played by a very young Jeff Goldblum in his very first screen appearance ) . But lets be fair . the movie is far from a perfect one . The movie has a typical experimental like ' 70's style , especially in its cinematography , that is interesting to watch but it adds very little and works distracting at times . The movie is also told very simple at times and some of the sequences even feel amateur like , to be honest . The story itself also feels extremely far fetched and unlikely . I mean , literally every time Paul Kersey goes outside he walks into trouble . He gets mugged several times and he encounters other thugs on numerous occasions . It's highly unlikely all , even for in a city like New York . The acting on the other hand is good . It's probably mainly thanks to Charles Bronson that his character works so well for the story . I also really liked Vincent Gardenia in his role . He brought some much needed comic relief and gave the story some extra flair and depth . A simple movie that mainly thanks to the original way it handles the story and characters , works out extremely well as a brutal action flick . Even though flawed , still an essential ' 70's viewing in my opinion .

Text2: A very nice , if imperfect , homage to Film Noir While I know that CHINATOWN has a great reputation and has received many 10s from reviewers , as a fan of Film Noir , I saw a few minor problems that kept the score from being a bit higher - - though it's still an exceptional film . First , as any devoted fan of Noir knows , Noir is always , and I repeat , always filmed in black and white . The great shadows and camera angles are an important trademark of the style . While this Roman Polanski film is beautifully filmed ( with a lot of sepia tones ) and it definitely has the look of a late 1930s Warner Brothers gangster film , it just isn't true Noir because it's in color ! Second , and this is a problem shared by THE BIG SLEEP , is that the plot is very , very complicated - - perhaps a bit too complicated - - making the resolution of mysteries and complications a bit too simple . The end , in particular , just seemed too convoluted a solution and left a lot of loose ends . BUT , getting past these factors , the film is still exceptional . Jack Nicholson was terrific and so was the rest of the cast . And the film was definitely interesting and exciting . It's definitely one of the better films of the 1970s - - but I just can't see this as a better film than many of the earlier Noir films , such as THE KILLERS , KISS OF DEATH or DOA .

But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy ? Well then , I guess , you simply disregard everything in terms of story-building or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie ! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slavery-saga "" Mandingo "" , released one year earlier , but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title , you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth , character drawings , unsettling atmosphere or thought-provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships . "" MandingA "" is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes , in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already . The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards , which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in South America . The elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower ( who probably also won a couple of "" Moustache-of-the-Year "" awards ) who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him . His mistress , who if I understood correctly is also his cousin ( ? ) , is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves .

The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times ( even in front of the slaves , supposedly to "" demonstrate "" how their masters do it ? ) but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter . His romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger , and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever . Hey ? I just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes "" Mandinga "" sound like an interesting film ! Well , it's NOT and I apologize if I raised anyone's anticipations . It's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through , but if the themes appeal to you , then definitely check out the aforementioned "" Mandingo "" . Much rather than sick exploitation , that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film , with real actors , great music and impressive filming locations . "" Mandinga "" has nothing , absolutely nothing to offer .


Text2: The Mirror has two Faces and one giant Pe ? This psychedelic 70's porn movie is stylish and oddly compelling , but still I can't bring myself to be as enthusiast as my fellow reviewers around here . Maybe I just anticipated a little more horror-elements or maybe I got a too upset because director Jonas Middleton presents a beautiful package but can't really hide the fact that there's very little in it . "" Through the Looking Glass "" is definitely the most ambitious porno movie of the overall rancid 70's offer , as it introduces a high social class family of three , living in a secluded mansion with a house staff . It seems like Catherine has it all made , including youthful beauty and wealth , but sexually speaking she's an extremely frustrated and unsatisfied woman . During her long and lonely days ( and nights ) alone in the house , Catherine goes to the attic to masturbate in front of the ancient mirror that reminds her of the childhood years with her father . Whether imaginary or supernaturally , the mirror ' sucks ' Catherine into a dreamy dimension where she encounters the weirdest and most perverted sexual situations . There aren't any taboos on the other side of the possessed mirror , as Catherine descents in a world of lesbian sex , outrageous Roman-like orgies and even incestuous reunions with her horny father . As the title implies , this film is indeed an adult variation on the world famous story "" Alice in Wonderland "" , but not nearly as demented or extreme as I had hoped . Sure Middleton hints at all the controversial themes , but there are never any genuinely shocking images on screen . The film does , however , feature some dared camera-work and several ingenious shots , like for example extreme close ups of female genitalia and even a journey into the lower body of the main starlet . Although elegantly photographed , the hardcore scenes quickly get tedious and , sadly enough , Catherine Burgess is the ONLY lady attractive enough to sexually arouse the male viewers . The other women look very random and their emotionless performances are a huge turn-off . The music is fantastic alas underused .

His demise ( . . the myth of his death from the duty of the fireman may or not be the truth ; if you survive the explosion of methane , wearing a suit which protects you from flame , then you are set free ) brings notoriety to the mine in present day where a guide , once a worker , takes visitors on an excursion 200 feet underground on a tour , explaining the duties and dangers of this line of work . Five Dutch teens + a counselor and two of his troubled youths take the tour into the mine . Kris ( Victorio Koblenko ) was having an argument with her father over her future when a truck crashes into their car , ending in an explosion which kills him right before her eyes . The mine tour , where Martiens legend lives and breathes giving the guide a spook story to tell , is in the vicinity of where Kris needed to retrieve a manuscript her father was working on regarding the notorious killer . . this is where she finds a Ouija board , the manuscript , and a music box of Martiens ( . . which may have something to it Martiens would've been interested in getting back ) . On an audio tape , played through a cassette player where her father was putting together a background of Martiens , we learn of why the killer needed 8 heads , and was willing to kill peasant children in order to do this . When the grounds keeper locks the gate leaving the tour forgetting about the last group of the day , they find that the lift which brought them underground isn't operational . Finding an access elsewhere to pursue help , the guide informs the group to stay put . Gathering around the Ouija board , the group summon Martiens evil spirit with all hell breaking loose as he can move from human host to human host seeking 8 heads so that he can exit hell . Once a devastating avalanche collapses the guide's exit , he's attacked by Susan , one of Mark's ( the counselor ) kids leaving the group to not only fend for themselves , but stuck with having to find another way out . Maybe , Kris can summon her father's spirit the same as Martiens for answers . . Dutch supernatural slasher with those possessed by the killer's spirit resembling those victims from "" Night of the Demons "" . . pale skin , discolored eyes , and snarling shark-like teeth . The setting is just perfect for a slasher , though . . inside an abandoned , labyrinthine coal mine , with the lights flickering , where , as the tour guide said while showing the gang around , that if you get lost , you get dead . When violence erupts and the possessed person attacks , the directors ' ( Frank van Geloven & Edwin Visser ) camera is frenzied , shaking all over the place , I guess trying to capture the frenetic nature such situations might produce . The cataleptic state of their camera during these attack scenes as our victims run for their lives ( . . or try to defend themselves ) might alienate many viewers . The cast of characters might be Dutch , but that's where it ends . . this kind of cast could star in any Friday the 13th movie , and we'd not know the difference except that they speak their native language . Kris is given development because , as you know slasher fans following this genre for ages , she's the "" final girl "" who is appropriately established , as is the counselor ( . . cleverly saved from death numerous times ) . The film goes out of it's way to keep those two alive at the end while others are mincemeat . One poor possessed soul gets half her head taken off by a spate which separates it from the rest of her body , flesh is ripped away from one fellow's limbs before getting his throat sliced just as he's about to hit pay-dirt from the mine , one gets her head blown apart by a shot gun blast after dying from a spear plunged through her , etc .

Text2: The Invisible Man One could say that Claude Rains ' invisible man is just as much the Universal Studios monster as any of the rest of them for his madness is so unhinged and wacky he even turns over a woman's baby carriage in a nearby village during quite a temperamental outburst . Claude Rains stars as a scientist who invents this formula to create invisibility . The problem is that he uses a certain chemical which affects sanity and creates this ever-growing madness that quickly unleashes a violent wave to just about anyone that draws near . Imagine the difficult position for the police who must try and stop him and the doctor's rampage of violence . He even causes a train to collapse over a cliff and throws two hunters ( . . looking for him ) over also . He wishes for Dr . Arthur Kemp ( William Harrington ) , a colleague , to assist him in his murdering ways and ultimately to gain wealth and prestige through the power he can wield being invisible . Kemp is in an unfortunate situation because he has little choice but to because Rains ' doctor can kill him without his knowledge . Only his lady love Flora ( Gloria Stuart of James Whale's film "" The Old Dark House "" ) can perhaps tap into the once human part that might still slightly exist inside this evil shell . The police will seek the help of Dr . Cranley ( Henry Travers ) who was Rain's employer for guidance in how to stop the man's rage of terror . James Whale really brings a great film together using stunning special effects considering when it was made . He infuses humor into the piece , including the screeching Una O'Conner as a hotel proprietor's snooping wife . The invisibility is quite a showcase and we feel and see the very terror that can wake from it being used on the wrong person not in the right state for such an experiment . Claude Rains has quite a challenge . . he has to make his presence known without being shown on screen at all until the very end and express himself through voice only . Whale is up to the task of creating the difficult part of having this man go throughout the film invisible through cunning and wit . The dialogue is key and the pacing of the film is excellent . This film may very well be Whale's true best film . I think it is .

The chemistry between her and O'Toole is almost perfect . The scenes of the pair locked in the museum closet are wonderful . The actual heist , while simple , is very effective and innovative for this kind of movie .

Text2: Madienform Bonfire Joanna Eberhart ( Katharine Ross ) has moved to Stepford with her husband and children . The place seems absolutely idyllic . But it's not long before Joanna and her new found friend Bobbie ( Paula Prentiss ) , also new to Stepford , begin to realize not all is as wonderful as it seems . The women in town seem to have no interests other than cleaning their houses and pleasing their husbands . Is it something in the water ? Joanna and Bobbie must discover the mystery of Stepford before they become its next victims . While The Stepford Wives may be slow going , it never gets dull . The slow pace adds a lot to the mystery . I've often argued that for effective suspense , you can't rush it . It takes time to build . And even though I knew exactly where The Stepford Wives was going , it was a joy to watch the mystery unfold . Two of the biggest things the movie has going for it are the cast and the script . As for the cast , Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss are outstanding . Ross plays her role in a very understated manner and isn't quick to jump to wild conclusions without adequate proof . Too often , characters in horror movies will jump to the wildest of conclusions without a shred of evidence . It makes things very unrealistic . As for Prentiss , she steals every scene in which she appears . And her character is one of the most intelligent , yet free-spirited characters I've seen recently in a movie . In fact , given the implausibility inherent in the story , the entire script is written intelligently . The characters speak and act as one would expect given the circumstances . Plus , any script with the phrase "" Madienform Bonfire "" is alright with me . I suppose my biggest complaint would be the lack of time given to the mansion that houses the Stepford Men's Association . I kept waiting for Joanna and Bobbie to do some amateur sleuthing , but it never happened . And even when Joanna finally gets inside , it's over far too quickly .

The plot , of course , only serves to gives people time to take a break between the comedy bits and the musical numbers . We also have a view of Roach silent comedy star , Glen Tryon as George White . The musical numbers are pretty good , particularly the first one with Gene Krupa , a triumph of choreography and camera-work . Krupa seems a little . . . . weird in the number , however , like he's on strong drugs and flipping out . Although this is not unheard of in drummers who are not on drugs , it may be significant that Krupa had spent time in jail on a marijuana rap in 1943 , and this might have been an attempt to capitalize on his ' bad boy ' image .

810,"Text1: What I Did For Love When Rob Lowe decided to wear his glasses for real in this film ( in real life he's quite nearsighted ) I think it was his and director Peter Bogdanovich's homage to Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby . Would that Bogdanovich had as good material as Howard Hawks had with Grant and Katharine Hepburn . Rob's a near do well here , living at home with mother Jessica James and brother Ira Heiden and sometimes whomever mom's current boyfriend is , in this case it's Harry Carey , Jr . in one of his very few roles not in a western . Rob gets a jury duty notice and like most of us , he considers it one royal pain . But when he's chosen for the jury trial of Colleen Camp it's an opportunity he's been waiting for since grade school . Back in those childhood years he was crushing out on Camp big time and now she's on trial for attempted murder . I wrote a review for 12 Angry Men in which I said the film was flawed because of what Henry Fonda did , going to the accused's neighborhood and buying a switchblade similar to the murder weapon . That was absolutely nothing compared to what Lowe does while he's not deliberating on the evidence to prove the object of his affection is innocent . The film has its moments , but I'd have to say it was more silly than funny . Colleen Camp is not quite Katharine Hepburn , though Lowe does give a good try at a Cary Grant type comedy part . Still fans of Rob Lowe will like it .


Text2: THE SLENDER THREAD ( Sydney Pollack , 1965 ) The late Sydney Pollack tried his hand at several different genres and succeeded in most ; since he never demonstrated an individualistic style ( for many he was the antithesis of an auteur ! ) , he could adapt himself to virtually anything ( and Pollack often set his sights on grand themes ) ‚Äì though the end result would always be somewhat artificial ( if undeniably slick ) because of the director‚Äôs impersonal approach ! Anyway , for his debut film , he settled on an intimate melodrama ‚Äì shot on location in glorious black-and-white ( incidentally , all his subsequent work would be in color ) . The plot is simple : Sidney Poitier is a student who works nights at a Seattle Crisis Clinic ; on one occasion , a call comes in where a wealthy socialite at the end of her tether ( Anne Bancroft ) declares she has deliberately overdosed on barbiturates ! She phoned not so much because she wanted help but rather so that someone will know of her outcome ; Poitier , however , determines to keep her on the line ‚Äì while he sets in motion a complex operation in order to trace Bancroft‚Äôs whereabouts and save her life . For about the first third of the film , Bancroft barely appears : we only hear her world-weary voice booming across the room at the clinic , Poitier having switched the call to the loudspeaker ; eventually , she starts to let her hair down and , in intermittent flashbacks , we see her movements during the last few days ( which boils down to her alienation from familial cords due to a past mistake which has come back to haunt her ) . While this was certainly a way to do it , I‚Äôm baffled as to why we never cut to where Bancroft is now until the last act : consequently , we have to contend with a fair bit of padding during the ‚Äòre-enactments‚Äô ( which could have easily been covered via dialogue delivered by the heroine ) ! That said , I guess it was a conscious decision on Pollack‚Äôs part to ‚Äòopen up‚Äô the drama ( not merely to include other characters ‚Äì most prominently , Steven Hill as the woman‚Äôs husband ‚Äì but also to utilize a number of exteriors , where he was able to exercise a keen eye for realistic detail ) . Still , the film compels attention despite an essentially contrived central situation : for instance , at this point , it‚Äôs best not to go into how Bancroft manages to remain lucid for so long or , even more importantly , why she just doesn‚Äôt hang up on Poitier ; and what about the plausibility of the latter‚Äôs temper-tantrums ( to the exasperation of clinic psychiatrist Telly Savalas ! ) to coerce the woman into reacting , thus hanging on to life in spite of herself ? But that‚Äôs Hollywood for you . . . and , in a talky film such as this , the emphasis is on the writing ( by Stirling Silliphant ) and the acting ( Bancroft is typically excellent and Poitier‚Äôs contribution , amounting to a variation on his PRESSURE POINT [ 1962 ] role , just as good if slightly overstated in the long run ) . Even so , as a counter-balance to the ongoing histrionics , reasonable suspense ‚Äì aided by up-to-date methods of detection ‚Äì is generated throughout by the race-against-time to locate Bancroft . At the end of the day , THE SLENDER THREAD emerges as a quite impressive ( and generally still powerful ) first outing ‚Äì recalling the gritty work of many a contemporary film-maker who , like Pollack , had emerged from TV .

811,"Text1: not for all tastes , but if you're in the right crazy-comedy mode it could be one of Woody's funniest films In its own nature , the film being made fun of within the film What's Up , Tiger Lily is inherently silly . It's a James Bond rip-off done to the Nth degree , where based on only a few films its Japanese B-movie counterpart does everything just in imagery alone to make it a ludicrous action-movie experience . Just in the opening moments , even before Woody Allen appears on the screen to explain the method to the madness in the film , is quite funny in a bad-movie sort of way . And I think that it's probably not too unexpected that it puts a divide in Woody Allen's audience . There's the group that's more into just his later style of wit and humor , and I can tell that for those it's not surprising to see some not really ' getting ' into this style of wacky , off-the-wall , cartoon humor . But after seeing a couple of more dramatic films recently , this one really did the trick . It's the film that was the most likely to spawn the underground Night of the Living Dead parody of 1991 , along with Kung Pow ( the former being better than the latter ) , but it also has a kin-ship , if not ascendancy , of the ZAZ comedies of the late 70s and 80s , and even a tinge of Mel Brooks . So , for me , this is actually one of my favorite Woody Allen comedies . Not really up as high in terms of cinematic ' quality ' ( in terms of craftsmanship , I mean ) as his 70s films , but with material like this , it's almost required not to carp . Woody and his team of writers and voice actors almost have it cut out for them . There's much to wonder , perhaps , in what the ' real ' plot of this Japanese spy film ( Kokusai himitsu keisatsu : Kagi no kagi , or International Secret Police : Key of Keys ) is almost as funny as what the writers come up with . Spies and assassins are on the look out for , get this , an Egg salad recipe ! But , of course , this is just as much a gimmick as is , well , much of the rest of what comes out of the actor's mouths . At times I wasn't even sure if it was all Woody Jokes , or which were ( twenty minutes , apparently , are not by Woody Allen's group but by someone else , though it's hard to tell which is a credit to most involved ) , but I didn't care . It's got the kind of jokes that , on a certain plain , can allow you to laugh like an idiot . Certain gags just come with the territory of the film itself , and are heightened by the added bits during fights . But much of the film is based on the wit Woody's known for , though here sometimes to equally ' bad-pun ' and juvenile terms , even featuring ( practically never in any of his other films ) rock and roll and cartoon-like voices ( my favorite the snake-obsessed henchman ) right out of Looney Tunes and Ren & Stimpy . So many lines strike up laughs to greater or lesser degrees it's hard to really spot them out , but it's suffice to say that by the time it's done - and through its end credits featuring an eye-exam - you'll know whether you'll want to watch it again like a ZAZ or Brooksfilm to memorize the quotable lines and bits , or put it in the lower , deeper-to-find section in your video collection . Things like a spy who bursts into an operatic love song during tense confrontation scenes , and with puns like "" two Wong's don't make a right "" , are what you can expect in this film , but there's more , and it will either ignite the anything-goes funny button , or just not do it for you . One thing's for sure , you'll never see the Lovin ' Spoonful the same way again . By the way , this review reflects the Woody Allen dub of the movie ( of what's there anyway ) , and it's available on the DVD ; recommended over the other dub that's been floating around too .


Text2: Wild at Heart has some memorable moments in this good Lynch movie A filmmaker , in particular a surrealist like David Lynch , has to be kind of careful with the way he makes his films , so that all of the abstract images and set-pieces and little moments in the stranger-than-life stories he makes can bring some awe or amazement to the viewer . He has done this in the past wonderfully with Eraserhead ( his most disturbing movie to me ) and Mulholland Drive , as well to a degree with Blue Velvet . With Wild at Heart , his second adaptation of a novel , he brings to the screen some moments that stick in your head , but some of them aren't really the kind that strike me crazy like with some of his other films . For example ( and I have a feeling this might be part Lynch , part novelist Barry Gifford , but I'm not sure ) he laces in a sort of subtext with the Wizard of Oz , as the two ( anti ) heroes of the film , Sailor and Lula ( Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern ) keep on seeing images of them . It's an effective image the first time , but working it into the plot makes it a little ridiculous ; I knew that the film was part pulp-fantasy , yet with the climax including a small speech from Glenda the Good witch to Sailor , it's very unfulfilled . It brought the film to a close with melodrama , but it left nothing mysterious , nothing that usually has me floored by Lynch in not explaining where these people will go . There are also other abstractions at times that go a little too overboard , a little too clever for Lynch's own good . These gripes aside , Wild at Heart is quite the entertainer , a sort of romantic exploitation picture that fuses elements from 1950's cinema ( Elvis , rock and roll , cool cars ) and gives its audience what it wants for the better part of two hours . The basic premise involves two young people , played Cage and Dern , who are very well matched , as Cage gives a believable turn with half-hammed up , half sincere attitude , and Dern giving one of her best so far . They meet each other and can't keep their hands or minds off of each other , eloping constantly throughout the film . But there are problems from the start - Sailor has just been released from prison , with a dark past , and can be a very violent person . Lula's mother , Marietta ( Diane Ladd in one of two very twisted performances in the film ) , can't stand Lula's choice , and will stop at nothing to see that Sailor doesn't get her , including hiring strong-men and a hit-man ( Harry Dean Stanton ) to track them down . Along the way , they run into some mishaps , and bad people ( one being Willem Dafoe , the other twisted performance ) as a lurid figure in the third act . There has been a lot written about the violence in the film , which is in fact very over-the-top ( almost in an Oliver Stone NBK way , but done in Lynch's own style of course ) . It's not offensive , but it isn't as if its entertaining . It's just , well , there , and it does work to fit into the story . What one can criticize is , like with the other abstractions I mentioned before , it leaves one a little empty or feeling out-of-place . The violence has to be there , there's no question about that , and it is in an exaggerated form of the obviously fake violence in the 1950's road movies . But it takes itself so not seriously , it's hard to take it into account with the rest of the story . There's a sense of some realism in the film , but I don't know if Lynch knows at times how to combat it with his surrealism . Still , this isn't to say he hasn't made a good film , he has : it contains a lot of his wit , a lot of flashes of great use of color , used expressively like the painter he is , and it does blend much of the time as an art film-cum-drive-in flick , and it contains some of the sexiest scenes Lynch has filmed ( he seems better with sex than violence ) .

Text2: Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman saved this movie . Anywhere But Here is not exactly anything new , but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching . Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills , California , in search of a better life . The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie would much rather have stayed in Wisconsin with all of her friends and family , and she felt that she was forced to go to California with her overbearing mother . ( spoilers ) While it's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable , Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new . Anywhere But Here doesn't cover any new ground , but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again . Also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years , seen on Natalie Portman's face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance . Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about Natalie's mother pressing her to become an actress , as well as a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's very close cousins from back home . His death is a tragic clich√© almost always seen in movies like this one , but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this .

Becker is the son of Jacques Becker - who had made classics like CASQUE D'OR ( 1952 ) , TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI ( 1954 ) and LE TROU ( 1960 ) - but he demonstrates little of his father's attention to detail , where the style actually served the plot and the characters rather than being merely surface gloss .

Five years later , still haunted by dreams and visions of a woman he loved in his previous life even while attempting to stay the top pit fighter , his past catches up to him . However he might not like what he remembers . Writer / Director Jesse Johnson made a film that looked significantly better then his meager budget would suggest . The fights are pretty brutal and well choreographed . The story while not the most original one is serviceable enough and while this is the sole film that I've seen or heard of Dominique Vandenberg , I can already tell that a more interesting actor to watch then , say , Don "" the Dragon ' Wilson . Now on to hunting down Vandenberg's "" The Honorable "" which I've heard great things about . the film is not without a few flaws , but I found it entertaining even if the ending comes across as more than a tad bit silly .

Text2: do whatever it is morons do . . . . While San Juan celebrates San Sebastian's Feast , recently-divorced and world-weary police captain Victor Benezet calls in prominent attorney Henry Hearst to clarify his statement about discovering the body of a girl of about 12 , the second such murder in two weeks . As Hearst answers unconvincingly , Benezet reveals circumstantial evidence : the lawyer is under suspicion . The interrogation strips away Hearst's dignity , public persona , and even his toupee , exposing a breech with his beautiful and much younger wife , questionable sexual predilections and a damning hobby . Then , Hearst's wife volunteers information that confirms police suspicions . Is Hearst finally at the breaking point ? . . . . as intriguing as the movie is , it's the ending that really suffers with problems . the main problem being that it doesn't know how to end , so from an amazing 110 minutes of vocal fisticuffs from the two leads , we are basically given a nonsense ending , which i guess Hopkins would have hoped would have the audience debating and so on . the main question i was asking at the end of the film was , why ? and what was the whole point ? obviously people are going to have their own opinions of Hearsts reason , as i do myself , but a lot of people may feel a little cheated as the film does lead the audience up the ' big revelation ' path , only for them to hit a brick wall . but the film is great to watch and offers red herrings galore . Jane in particular was a very suspicious character , and threw me off the films trail at times , but the film is a lesson in acting masterclass whenever hackman and Freeman share the screen . a genius part of film making is putting all the characters into Hearsts recollections , as i feel this would have been a rather redundant production if it was in one setting . Maybe Hearst was taking his power and seeing how far it would take him , or maybe he wanted to set his wife free , the explanation is never revealed , but if you are a fan of the two leads , this will suffice .

817,"Text1: A little bit of Grudge with a twist at the end . I mainly say it is sort of like Grudge is the hotel setting , or rather the haunted house scenario . This is the first of the after dark horror movies I have seen , and it was okay . Certainly better than other Japanese horror movies , but then it was not super special either . This one starts out with random people encountering ghosts and switches focus on a movie being made about a mass slaying at a hotel . The director is casting the part and selects one girl who just seems to strike him as different . We also get introduced to a student who has reoccurring dreams of said hotel . Her scenes seem to make little sense until the end where everything comes together rather nicely . You should figure out what is about to occur a bit before it happens though as it is telegraphed . Still you get your creepy ghost encounters , your somewhat interesting back story , and a bit of blood thrown in for good measure . I was not entirely happy with the ending , however I did like the way the movie progressed . I was a tad confused with the introduction of the student , however , another movie Kairo was worse with switching scenarios as this one was much easier to roll with than that one . After the revelation at the end though I thought it could have wrapped up quicker , but the look on the girl's face as she was totally freaking out was priceless . A tad creepy and interesting , nothing totally new , but it works .

I will say I really enjoyed it the first and second time I saw it , but I have to say this movie is definitely for kids and they will get the most enjoyment of seeing Elliot help the little alien call his friends to pick him up .

818,"Text1: HOUSE OF THE DAMNED ( Maury Dexter , 1963 ) An obscure and rather uneventful but nevertheless atmospheric and effective little chiller which presents us with a new twist on "" the old dark house "" theme which may ultimately disappoint some viewers . I won't divulge it here for those who may feel inclined to check this one out : I'll just say that it combines elements from two well-known Tod Browning movies - FREAKS ( 1932 ) and MARK OF THE VAMPIRE ( 1935 ) - and leave it at that ! The plot deals with an architect and his wife having to spend the night in the infamous ( and supposedly uninhabited ) Rochester castle , who are later joined by the former's boss and his sassy girlfriend . However , before long , things start to go bump in the night : a bunch of keys mysteriously disappear and reappear with a couple of them missing , a few doors are inexplicably forbidden to the house dwellers , the girlfriend disappears after a quarrel with her intended , etc . It all seems to point in the direction of the crazed proprietress of the mansion who is currently spending her days in a mental institution but , eventually , we discover that there are even stranger forces at work here . . . As I said before , the moody lighting and occasional ' scary ' set-pieces are the whole show in this one but , despite the lack of star names , the foursome acquit themselves quite adequately under the circumstances ; in the latter stages of the film , Richard "" Jaws "" Kiel also makes an appearance as an unexpected ' guest ' of the Rochester mansion . The low-priced Fox DVD is accompanied by a theatrical trailer which should not be viewed before the main feature as it virtually shows snippets from all the film's best sequences ; interestingly , the much brighter trailer enabled me to make out some details which had eluded me during the film itself !


Text2: PUNCH DRUNKS ( Lou Breslow , 1934 ) Pretty much on the same level of WOMAN HATERS ( 1934 ) , though without the rhyming dialogue ; ironically , the style of comedy seen here seems like a dry run for later Abbott & Costello efforts ( with the comical prizefighting bout recalling that duo‚Äôs 1951 meeting with The Invisible Man ) ! Again , The Stooges consider female companionship as irresistible but essentially intrusive ; Moe slaps his buddies around so often that one wonders whether anyone got hurt during the making of these films ! An interesting twist here is that Curly‚Äôs combative skill is triggered by the playing of "" Pop Goes The Weasel "" ; predictably , Larry‚Äôs playing of the song on his violin is made impossible during the decisive fight when Curly falls on top of him from the ring ‚Äì thus causing Larry to run out of the arena to search for possible replacements ( first coming up with a radio and then a truck fitted with a loudspeaker , which he drives through the walls of the building ) !

820,"Text1: THEY MADE ME A FUGITIVE ( Alberto Cavalcanti , 1947 ) This is a relatively rare example of a British film noir , but one which can hold its own alongside the more celebrated American variety . Director Cavalcanti's background in documentaries certainly served him in good stead here , bringing complete authenticity to the situations and settings . Still , thanks to Otto Heller's outstanding camera-work and lighting , he manages a number of strikingly cinematic visuals ( for instance , the scene where heroine Sally Gray is beaten up by chief villain Griffith Jones ) . It features a splendid cast , all of whom deliver excellent performances : Trevor Howard is an unusual hero-type but totally credible ; lovely leading lady Sally Gray may come off a bit too good to be true ( she initially commits herself to the framed Howard merely because her gangster boyfriend has jilted her for the latter's own fianc√©e ! ) but she elicits all the petite sex appeal of a Veronica Lake ( meanwhile her love / hate banter with Howard evokes memories of the Robert Donat / Madeleine Carroll pairing from Hitchcock's THE 39 STEPS [ 1935 ] ) ; Griffith Jones is a suave yet ruthless leader of a black-market ring ( but who gets his just desserts in particularly gruesome fashion ) ; Mary Merrall is Jones ' elderly associate , whose level-headedness and experience keeps the violent gangster in check ; a young Ballard Berkeley is a sympathetic Scotland Yard man , but who doesn't think twice about using Howard as bait to capture the entire gang ; Peter Bull turns up for a bit as a police informer . The general gloominess ( a mainstay of thrillers emanating from the post-war era ) is leavened somewhat by its constant flurry of hard-boiled dialogue courtesy of screenwriter Noel Langley . The terrific climax is set inside the gang's ' business ' office - a funeral parlor , amusingly named "" The Valhalla Undertaking Co . "" . Still , perhaps my favorite scene in the entire film is Howard's surreal encounter with the zombie-like Vida Hope - in whose household he stumbles while on the run ; she turns out to be deranged , and even tries to talk our hero into murdering her alcoholic husband ( Maurice Denham ) ! As is typical of old films released on DVD by Kino , the quality of the print and transfer leave a lot to be desired - but one has to be grateful still , because otherwise gems such as this one would remain unavailable indefinitely . . .


Text2: No Americans in Africa in June of 1942 Humphrey Bogart after scoring his big success in The Petrified Forest was signed to a long term Warner Brothers contract and only made two outside films while he was under contract for 12 years . The first was Dead End for Sam Goldwyn and the second was Sahara for Columbia . So Bogey was working with at another studio with a group of unfamiliar players . But this is Bogey post Casablanca when he became very big box office indeed . Harry Cohn must have laid out a lot of cash to Jack Warner for his services . Sahara is a fine allegorical film about a patchwork quilt of allied fighters standing up to Nazism . Humphrey Bogart and his tank crew of Bruce Bennett and Dan Duryea come across a group of British Eighth Army regulars commanded by a medical officer . They get the news Tobruk has fallen and they have to make it back to their lines . First things first though , they need to get water . Along the way this motley crew picks up a Sudanese and his Italian prisoner , Rex Ingram and J . Carrol Naish . Then they shoot down a German plane and capture its pilot Peter Van Eyck . Reaching a nearly tapped out oasis ahead of the Germans they make a heroic stand as the Germans are out of water themselves . They play a deadly psychological game with the Germans and most of them don't survive . Sahara is a curious film . It's a good psychological as well as war film that has absolutely no basis in facts . When Tobruk fell there was not one American GI in all of North Africa . At the end of the film , the survivors hear about the First Battle of El Alamen where General Claude Auchinleck and the Eighth Army held the line against Rommel and stopped his drive to the Suez . What Bogey , Bennett , and Duryea were doing there is beyond me . Usually the gambit is to make Americans , Canadians to explain non-British accents . It wasn't used here however . By the time Sahara was in theaters , a combined British-American expeditionary force had already landed in Morocco and that was September , 1943 . I guess our gullible audience thought Bogey was already in the thick of it . Anyway that rather glaring historical inaccuracy has always prevented me from thoroughly enjoying Sahara .

Text2: Has a few decent ideas , but the results are mediocre , at best Not quite as terrible as I had heard , but most definitely mediocre . There are some good ideas that hint that it could have been a decent horror movie , perhaps if it had a better director . Stephen Hopkins is a pretty big hack , his credits including the abysmal Lost in Space and the not - that - bad - but - not - that - great - either thriller Blown Away ( the Jeff Bridges movie , not the one with the Cories ) . Hilary Swank plays a former missionary who has lost her faith and now works at debunking miracles . She is recruited by a small Louisiana town that is apparently being revisited by Old Testament plagues , starting with their river turning into blood . The town is blaming it on an untrusted household out on the bayou , which they think may be involved in Satanic rituals . In particular , they fear the 12 year-old girl who lives out there ( played by AnnaSophia Robb of Bridge to Terabithia ) . The film is definitely silly , and it's annoyingly religious ? which doesn't make too much sense , as the fundamentalists it seems to want to appeal to would avoid it like the , ahem , plague because of its violence and nastiness . But it never reaches the abysmal and insulting level of , say , The Exorcism of Emily Rose , and that angle can work well , like in , say , The Exorcist . But I quite liked the bayou atmosphere , which seems perfectly suited to a horror movie . The plague of locusts sequence is not bad , although it would have worked a lot better if they weren't such phony-looking CGI . And Swank is good . I always wonder how history will see her . She's one of the worst whores in the movie industry right now , and clearly does almost all of her films for money . In 2007 alone , she made three utterly forgettable films , the other two being P . S . I Love You and Freedom Writers . She's won two Oscars , both for dressing like men . Both were entirely justifiable , too ( although she wouldn't be near my top choice in 2004 ) . But in between those two films she made The Core , a movie about a crew of scientists drilling to the center of the Earth in order to make it start spinning again , and which included the line "" So you want me to hack the Earth ? "" Come to think of it , I really need to see that movie some day . The trailer had me on the floor . In 2009 , Swank will be dressing like a man once again when she plays Amelia Earhart for Mira Nair . I can almost guarantee an Oscar nomination .

825,"Text1: The job Ermanno Olmi was a documentary maker in Italy during the 1950s . His roots were in the neo-realism movement that he , like most film fans , greatly admired and cherished their realistic stories . His arrival in the scene as an important voice was cemented with "" Il Posto "" , a film that established him as a man to be reckoned with . We had seen a restored copy of this magnificent film when it was shown at New York's Film Forum about four years ago and recently , we decided to take another look of the Criterion DVD , a wonderful transfer that will probably open his work to movie lovers all over . "" Il Posto "" is a great film because it doesn't pretend to be otherwise . Mr . Olmi , working on the screen play with Ettore Lombardo created a picture of the Italy during the boom after their defeat in WWII , as the country was getting back to the business of reconstruction . It was about this time that cities like Milan and Turin , in the north of the country , became the centers for manufacturing and commerce . It is in this context that we are taken to meet Domenico Cantoni and his family . They have come to Meda , a suburb of Milan , in search of better paid jobs . In the case of Domenico , scoring a position in one of those giant companies it means steady income and a job for life . Domenico is a clever young man and passes his math test with flying colors . This is the moment when he first sees another young woman , Magali , who is also taking the test . Domenico likes what he sees , but he is too shy to do anything that will make Magali think less of him . When he receives a notification for further tests and interviews , it appears he has been accepted by the firm . This , in turn , turns to be a situation that changes his hopes for developing some sort of relationship with Magali as they are assigned to two different areas of work . Domenico can't even see Magali during his lunch time because they are assigned to different shifts . As Domenico , who aspires to be an accountant within the firm , is assigned to be a messenger apprentice , something he clearly doesn't deserve , but he must accept , we follow him around different areas within the company . We are taken to watch the people in one typical accounting department , where older employees bide their time until they can retire . Domenico , who hopes to finally hook up with Magali at the company's New Year's party , is once again disappointed when she never arrives . Instead , he must spend a night surrounded by the same people he will be working with . The final sequence of the film shows how Domenico is able to move to the spot where he will probably spend the rest of his life , in which he , being the youngest , is suddenly the center of the department's ill will . Sandro Panseri makes a fantastic Domenico . This non-professional actor registers in his face all what is going in his head without great gestures , or other affectations . Domenico conquers the viewer's heart because he is genuine and because we realize the goodness in his soul . Loredana Detto , who appears as Magali also makes an impression . "" Il Posto "" is blessed by Pier Emilio Bassi's music score and by the black and white cinematography of Roberto Barbieri and Lamberto Caimi . The film is a triumph for Ermanno Olmi , who captured the ambiance and the gist of that era in a wonderful film that will live forever .


Text2: The Willarts John Frankenheimer was not a director of domestic dramas . Working on the James Leo Herlihy novel , adapted by William Inge , Mr . Frankenheimer shows his versatility in "" All Fall Down "" . The director working with some of the best actors of the era , created a film that , although forgotten , had a lot going for it . We are introduced to Berry-Berry Willart , a young man from Cleveland . He is in jail , as the movie opens . It appears Berry-Berry has a problem with beating women . Berry-Berry's problems seems to stem from a deeply rooted complex with his home life . He would have been a candidate for analysis because he probably would have been able to get a rein on his problem . Since he is seen as young stud , he attracts the kind of women that are either insecure , or have not a great sex life . His younger brother , Clinton , has come to what appears to be Key West , to bail him out . Berry-Berry decides to stick around Florida , a fertile ground for what he is looking for . We watch him as he is hired by an older woman , Mrs . Mandel , for a trip to the Bahamas in her husband's yacht . Later , Berry-Berry catches a ride north with the lonely schoolteacher going home for a Christmas vacation . The trip ends as the young man beats the mousy schoolteacher and lands in jail . In the meantime , we are taken to the Willart home . Annabell is a nagging wife that appears to be unfulfilled with the life she and Ralpht , her alcoholic husband , lead in Cleveland . Clinton , the younger son , is plainly aware of the unhappiness around him . He seems to live in his own world , tuning out the bickering between his parents . Enter Echo O'Brian , the young and pretty friend of the family . Echo is a happy go lucky "" old maid "" , by her own account , in her early thirties . It's obvious her interest in men is limited . When Berry-Berry , the prodigal son returns for a visit , Echo feels sexually aroused by the young stud . Suddenly , it appears that Berry-Berry is changed until he realizes Echo was hiding something from him . This discovery ends in tragedy . Warren Beatty was probably made to look like a Jimmy Dean by the studio in order to capitalize on his good looks . Mr . Beatty was a strange actor ; on dramatic roles , he is not as effective as when he played rogues , or comedies . Evidently Mr . Frankenheimer was after something that doesn't come across quite clearly , but Mr . Beatty's Berry-Berry , is a light weight playing against more accomplished actors . Eva Maria Saint is perfect as Echo . She is a woman who hasn't experienced much in her life . When she meets Berry-Berry , she suddenly is able to experience all what she probably has denied herself . Angela Lansbury has one of the best moments of her brilliant career as Annabell . Ms . Lansbury , who went to work with Mr . Frankenheimer in "" The Manchurian Candidate "" , is one of the best reasons for watching the movie . In fact , Mr . Herlihy's book seems to have been adapted by Mr . Inge as though he was presenting one of his frustrated midwest women that were his specialty . Karl Malden also fares well under Mr . Frankenheimer's direction . Being a more experienced actor of stage and screen , Mr . Malden gives a realistic portrayal of Ralph , a man lost in alcohol , in order to escape the dreary married life with Annabell . Brandon de Wilde , as Clinton also does a good job as Clinton , the young Willart that knows all the secrets in his family . The minor roles are played well by Constance Ford , who only has a scene , but she makes the best of her Mrs . Mandel . Also , Barbara Baxley , another stage actress that knew the lonely and insecure schoolteacher she is seen playing . The film also has a good music score by Alex North and a crisp black and white cinematography by Lionel Lindon . In fact , the print we recently viewed appears to have been kept in mint condition . John Frankenheimer has to be congratulated for his achievement in this film .

Text2: "" Fellow jack-asses - - and ladies ! Lend me your long ears . "" Most of the silent films I've seen have been serious in nature , so it was fun to see one with a comic touch . The setting and some of the scenes for "" The Beloved Rogue "" were reminiscent of 1923's "" The Hunchback of Notre Dame "" relative to the Paris street scenes and the celebration of the ' King of Fools ' . John Barrymore portrays France's greatest poet Francois Villon in a characterization that ranges quite broadly from virtual slapstick to romantically tender ; that ' water into wine ' bit early in the picture was rather amusing . It seems that times never change , and it's interesting to see the movie make a cogent observation nearly a century ago - Paris has it's fool to reign for one night , while everywhere else has one all the time . How true . The appearance of Conrad Veidt in the film was a little surprising for this viewer , I've only seen him as Major Strasser in "" Casablanca "" , oddly one of his very last movies . As King Louis XI , he's a monarch obsessed with astrology , crafty but suspicious , and it was a bit unnerving to see how closely he resembled Brad Dourif's Wormtounge character from the final chapter of the ' Lord Of The Rings ' trilogy . Not exactly exuding the confidence a King of France might be expected to bear . Which is why the ascendancy of Burgundy's duke ( Lawson Butt ) seemed all the more plausible , until Villon rises to the occasion to put one over on both rulers . I found it interesting that the use of inter-title cards was exceedingly spare , used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story . Without them though , one would have missed a curious nugget . It seems Villon carried out his exile from Paris at the Hostel of the Lame Flea ! The print I viewed was of exceptional quality , the very first film presented in a one hundred Action and Suspense movie DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment , that's saying something for a film that's now eighty years old . It's great that movies from the silent era are now finding a wider distribution in this type of commercial format , making them accessible to an entirely new generation of movie lovers . One question - did it seem like Conrad Veidt's King Louis picked his nose on purpose , or as an inadvertent gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room ?

827,"Text1: Almost a horror movie at times , this is one fantastic thriller and one of the Coens ' best I'm not sure one viewing can do this film justice . It leaves a lot to think about , and I spent a good portion of my Sunday reading other people's views to see if I can come to some sort of conclusion about it . But I can't yet . Well , I can come to the conclusion , in any case , that this is a fantastic movie . There's no doubt about that . The Coens go back to their darker , noir-inspired sides , making the barren Texas landscape feel as cold as the Minnesota winter . The central story has a Vietnam veteran , played by Josh Brolin , finding a bundle of cash on the scene of a drug deal gone wrong . Meanwhile , a methodical killer by the name of Anton Chigurh ( Javier Bardem ) hunts him down . On the sidelines is an aging sheriff ( Tommy Lee Jones ) who works something like a Greek chorus , commenting on the main action but never able to have any effect on it . Looked at as a simple piece of film-making , No Country is brilliant . The Coens create a couple of the best setpieces they've ever done . They crank the tension up so high that I ? along with the entire audience ? was holding my breath . This is the closest thing the Coens have ever made to a horror movie , too . At times , it reminded me of a slasher , where we're waiting to see Chigurh dispose of his next victim in a gruesome way . But unlike your common director of a slasher movie , the Coens know how to make movies . It's not enjoyable when someone gets killed here . It feels all too realm and frankly it was scaring the hell out of me at times . Bardem plays the most memorable movie monster of the current decade . The character even sees himself as a monster , of sorts , as a hand of fate . In that way , Chigurh reminds me of another movie character , Ryunosuke Tsukue , Tatsuya Nakadai's character in Kihachi Okamoto's Sword of Doom . The two films share some similarities ( surely unintentionally ) , for example the almost Brechtian dodge of a conventional climax that forces us to reconsider what ? and who ? the films are actually about . I think one big question that I've come up with is whether the film sees Chigurh as a force of nature , or whether it is just Chigurh seeing himself that way , and that he is as much subject to the forces of nature and fate as anyone else in the story . No Country started to lose me a little when it went after some big themes at the end . I feel like I didn't absorb everything there was , and maybe I just didn't "" get "" what the authors ( the Coens and Cormac McCarthy , with whose work I'm entirely unfamiliar outside of this film ) were going for . But I also have a sneaking suspicion that the big themes get a little lost , that the Coens don't accomplish everything they set out to do . But I am eager to see this again ? and again ? to see if I can work it all out .

828,"Text1: Good Quincy murder mystery . Quincy M . E . : Valleyview starts as Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is asked to perform a private autopsy on seventy six year old Howard Phillips by his Grandson David ( Ed Begley Jr . ) , the official cause of death is a heart attack but David is sure that was not the case & that the Doctor's at Valleyview Sanitarium are hiding something . After the autopsy Quincy is puzzled , he has no idea how Howard died & it certainly wasn't from a heart attack although Quincy discovers Howard was suffering from prostate cancer . Then another body , that of mentally retarded teenager Anne , is brought in on a tip-off & again Quincy can find no cause of death . Quincy then thinks that there may be a mercy killer at Valleyview murdering terminally ill patients but no-one will believe him & without any evidence he has nowhere to go . . . Episode 12 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Ronald Satlof & is a very entertaining murder mystery with which to pass fifty odd minutes . Here the sensitive & emotive issue of euthanasia & mercy killing is brought up but while in later seasons of Quincy this issue would have been explored much deeper , dominated proceedings & been the moral issue of the week here in Valleyview it is merely used as a backdrop & motive for multiple murder that Quincy has to use his medical knowledge & skills to solve & as such doesn't go to much into the moral & social issues , implications & arguments surrounding the delicate topic which is fine with me since I much prefer the murder mystery themed Quincy episodes than the overly heavy handed moralistic ones . Valleyview is solid throughout , there's a steady stream of murder victims , there's a strong mystery element , the final outcome isn't too obvious & will probably keep you guessing until the end , there's the scenes where Quincy comes up against & fights bureaucracy , there's the scenes where no-one will believe Quincy & his ideas & there's that trademark Quincy humour . Pretty much all any Quincy fan would want from an episode really . There's nothing that is particularly memorable in this episode , it's well made but somewhat flat & a bit bland . Have you ever noticed the production team use the same still shot of Quincy's car parked outside Danny's ? I'm sure it's just a single stock photograph that they use as a quick establishing shot to show that Quincy is at Danny's in the same way all the exterior shot's of Quincy's building look exactly the same ! The acting is alright here so there's no problems on that front , TV & Hollywood veteran Ed Begley Jr . makes his first of three Quincy guest appearances & would next feature in the excellent No Way to Treat a Body ( 1978 ) during season four while Carolyn Jones made this the same year she starred in Tobe Hooper's one time ' video nasty ' here in the UK the sleazy killer man eating Crocodile flick Eaten Alive ( 1977 ) . Valleyview is a good solid early Quincy murder mystery that has a hint of a moral message but thankfully doesn't let it overshadow or dominate the mystery crime elements .


Text2: "" I was tired of being a vegetable . "" Rubbishy third instalment of the Blind Dead series of films . El Buque Maldito , or the more common English title of The Ghost Galleon along with various other's like Ghost Ships of the Blind Dead , Horror of the Zombies , Ship of the Zombies , The Blind Dead 3 & Zombie Flesh Eater , starts in a modelling studio owned by Lillian ( Maria Perschy ) who has been hired by rich businessman Howard Tucker ( Jack Taylor ) to supply two girls for a publicity stunt to promote his new boat . Kathy ( Blanca Estrada ) & Lorena ( Margarita Merino ) are the chosen two , they are to be stranded out at sea , rescued & then tell the waiting world how fantastic Tucker's boat was in their bid for survival . A perfect plan right ? Well no because Kathy's best friend Noemi ( Barbara Rey ) threatens to call the police so Tucker's goon Sergio ( Manuel de Blas ) has to kidnap her & while out at sea Kathy & Lorena run into a ghostly galleon that sails in perpetual fog . Soon all contact with the girls is lost , fearing bad publicity for his boat Tucker decides to sail out there himself & look for them on the quiet , along with Sergio , Noemi , Lillian & a meteorologist named professor Gruber ( Carlos Lemos ) who has heard tales of the ghost galleon before . They quickly find the galleon ( despite the whole Atlantic ocean to search ) & board it but fail to find the girls , that night from deep within the bowls of the ship the undead Knight Templars rise seeking fresh blood for their cannibalistic rituals . . . This Spanish production was written & directed by Amando de Ossorio & was the third instalment of the Blind Dead series of films & it's not very good . The script by Ossorio is awful , it's painfully slow , lacks any sort of exploitation & blood or gore has terrible unlikable character's that irritate immensely & is a chore to sit through which is a shame because I really liked the central idea of a ghost galleon travelling the sea in a cloud of fog . Every character & most of their actions in El Buque Maldito are so dumb it's unbelievable , the stranded character's quickly discover that the Knight Templars only rise at night ( which begs the question how can they emerge from the sea at the end in the middle of the day , but that's another question ) which would give them a reasonable amount of time to try & figure out a plan right ? I'd say 10 hours at least , so why does it take until half an hour before the Knight Templars are due to rise before someone finally has the ingenious plan to throw their coffins overboard ? There is a scene that comes from nowhere when the weather professor casually says that he knows a little bit about exorcism , yeah right because that's the sort of thing everyone knows a little about isn't it ? Especially meteorologists . So it continues with some of the dumbest scenes & dialogue you can think of . El Buque Maldito will put most people to sleep , it's over half an hour before we see the Knight Templars & even when they do make an appearance they don't do anything much , except walk , slowly , very slowly . Director Ossorio creates a wonderful atmosphere on the galleon , the creaking wood , the torn sails , the period decor & fixtures , the dirt dust & the whole look & feel is quite unique , it's just a shame Ossorio made such a lame film around it . The Knight Templars look exactly the same as the rest of the series minus the slow motion horses while the gore is virtually none existent . During the entire film there is one on screen murder & it's actually a good one , someone has there neck sliced with a sword , the Templars then also get to eat their victims severed hands & drink some blood . Unfortunately one decent kill can't compensate for the rest of the film . Technically El Buque Maldito is OK but the one thing that spoils it are the absolutely awful miniature ghost galleon effects , they really are that bad , they look like a paper boat in a bathtub & just wait until you see it burn & sink at the end , very funny & completely destroys the mood .

From Luigi Cozzi , the same dependably derivative dimestore cinema ace who blessed us with the marvelously mindless "" Star Wars "" copy "" Starcrash , "" comes this equally unoriginal , but still immensely enjoyable , often funny and excessively tacky Italian "" ALIEN "" cash-in . Severely demented'n'tormented German astronaut Siegfried Rauch brings back from Mars a gaggle of noisy , sticky , glowing bright green watermelon-sized eggs which are stored in a Columbian warehouse and smuggled into America ( they're disguised as prime coffee beans ! ) on a rusty freighter . Said evil eggs spew forth a foul , viscous , deadly liquid that makes folks explode something disgusting ; their torsos blow out and their guts erupt all over the place in a most wonderfully repulsive way . Naturally , the whole thing's a pernicious plot to wipe out the human race and make our planet more open to being colonized by your typically malevolent invading horde of conquer-happy extraterrestrials . The telepathic , slime-covered , preposterously hokey-looking wicked ET cyclops leader will make you laugh so hard that you might very well dry out your tear ducts .

Atouk gets banished from his tribe by hulking brute chief Tonda ( fearsome behemoth John Matuszak ) . Atouk becomes leader of his own tribe of misfits . Moreover , the sweet Tala ( Shelley Long at her most cute and appealing ) gets a crush on Atouk . Director Carl Gottlieb , who also co-wrote the blithely inane script with Rudy DeLuca , crafts a good-natured piece of silliness that unfolds at a constant snappy pace and maintains an amiably daffy and pleasant tone throughout . Sidesplitting comic highlights include the discovery of fire , the invention of music , a predatory tyrannosaurus rex getting stoned after eating marijuana , a gut-busting appearance by a shaggy and shambling Abominable Snowman ( towering Richard Moll in gnarly make-up designed by Chris Walas ) , and Lana's ultimate comeuppance . The screwball humor remains endearingly goofy from start to finish ; it never becomes too mean or vulgar . The delightfully ridiculous stop-motion animation dinosaurs by David Allen are especially hilarious . In addition , the enthusiastic cast have a ball with the broad material , with stand-out work by Dennis Quaid as Atouk's loyal friend Lar , Jack Gilford as blind old man Gog , Cork Hubbert as dwarf Ta , and Evan Kim as articulate Asian dude Nook . Alan Hume's slick cinematography makes nifty frequent use of wipes . Lalo Schifrin's robust , bouncy , funky score likewise hits the nutty spot . A cool and amusing romp .

830,"Text1: Ridicules over-the-top WWII propaganda movie 1944 WWII propaganda movie about the fliers who were captured after the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo Japan on April 18 , 1942 . Of the 80 US fliers involved 71 including Gen . Doolittle made it to safety and of the eight that were captured by the Japanese ; three not all eight like in the movie "" The Purple Heart "" were executed . Ridiculously played out in a Shang-Hai courtroom with the captured US fliers having the run of the courtroom . Breaking out with bombastic and patriotic laden speeches as the almost befuddled Japanese justices and military men stand open-mouth and stunned . Making it look like that they were so impressed by the Americans eloquent oratory that they were left completely speechless . I doubt that this was in real life but in the movie the American fliers represent almost every nationality , with the exception of a black and Hispanic , that you can find . Understandingly back in 1944 the movie had to overdo the goodness of the captured US fliers and at the same time dehumanize the evil and treacherous "" Japs "" , but was so outrageous that watching it now the movie almost made the "" Japs "" look good at the expense of the captured and heroic Americans . There was also a scene in the movie where it supported the killing of one's father by a son in favor of strangers , the Americans , who testified against them . This was like the movies made in the 1950's like "" My Son John "" were it was encouraged for parents to turn over their sons and daughters to the police or FBI if they suspected that they were communists . Even if they were not a threat to the countries security but only talked about how great it , communism , was . One scene that seemed to be completely overlooked in the movie that the film makers put in trying to show how insane the Japanese were and how normal and feeling the Americans were was the comparison between Japanese Gen . Mitsubi , Richard Loo , and the US . Gen . MacAthur . Gen . Mitsubi shoots himself when he can't get the US fliers to admit that they came from the aircraft carrier Hornet , which they did , because he felt that he fell down on his job . This without getting anybody under his command killed or wounded . All Gen . Mitsubi wanted was to make a point and the general is made in the movie to look like a crazed lunatic . Earlier in the movie when it's reported that Corrigador fell to the Japanese and that Gen . MacAthur fled and left his troops behind the captured US fliers acted as if Gen . MacAthur did a great and heroic act . As pilot Capt . Ross , Dana Andrews , remarked : "" The General did what he had to do and we'll do what we have to do "" which was saying nothing to their Japanese captors about where they came from , the Hornet , and getting executed ! Now that's whats meant by rank has it's privileges . The Japanese judges tried very hard to prove that the Americans bombed Japanese civilian targets , and as far as I know about the Doolittle Raid they didn't , to make the US look bad to the world and trumped up evidence to make it look that way . In reality when we look back at the massive B29 fire-bombing attacks on Japan it should have been an open and shut case for them without making up the facts . Hundreds of thousands of innocent Japanese were killed in fire bombing of Japanese cities that had nothing to do with the Japanese war effort but everything to do with terrorizing the Japanese population . An action that was condemned by the Nuremberg War Crime Tribune as a major war crime and had hundreds of German and Japanese officials who were convicted of it executed or jailed for life . Also the atomic attacks on Japan in August 1945 with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagagsaki are now believed to have been totally uncalled for . Since we know now that Japan was secretly trying to surrender to the allies at the time and that even Gen . MacAthur and Gen . Eisenhower were against using them on Japan . It now turns out that the dropping of the atomic bombs was a political not military decision , to impress USSR dictator Joseph Stalin , by the then US President Harry S . Truman .


Text2: Heart is the Mediator Between Brains and Muscles ? A Futuristic View of the Fight of Classes In the future , the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes : the workers , who live in the underground below the machines level , and the dominant classes that lives in the surface . The workers are controlled by their leader Maria ( Brigitte Helm ) , who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers , since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles . Maria meets Freder Fredersen ( Gustav Fr√∂hlich ) , the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen ( Alfred Abel ) , in a meeting of the workers , and they fall in love for each other . Meanwhile , Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis , and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate them . "" Metropolis "" is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes . When "" Metropolis "" was shot , it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history , with socialist movements around the world . Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides , showing that they need each other . I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in 1927 , with very primitive cameras and equipment . The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York . The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role , and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art . Title ( Brazil ) : "" Metropolis ""

831,"Text1: Interesting little psychological thriller . . . a little ahead of its time . . . RICHARD DIX was never one of my favorite actors , relegated as he was to mostly the kind of B films that played the lower half of double bills . Here he has a role reminiscent of the Wolf Larsen character in Jack London's THE SEA WOLF , although not quite as vicious on the surface . It's not exactly a complex role for the actor , since it's not written with any real exploration of character , but he does fairly well in it nevertheless . He's especially good toward the climax when his true nature is revealed . RUSSELL WADE , who looks somewhat like a more boyish version of Joel McCrea ( if that's possible ) , is the young 3rd Officer assigned to the ship by Captain Stone ( RICHARD DIX ) and eager to be welcomed as a member of the crew . But when strange things begin to happen , and one unfortunate man ( LAWRENCE TIERNEY , uncredited ) is ruthlessly dispatched by the Captain , Wade begins to suspect that Dix has lost his mind and is wreaking some kind of vengeance on the crew . Some nice B & W photography by Nicholas Musuraca gives atmospheric feeling to sustain an eerie mood throughout , but the script leaves a lot to be desired . Especially pointless is the sub-plot involving EDITH BARRETT , who always looks like such a frightened sparrow . Her involvement is hardly necessary to forward the plot . A more intense performance from Russell Wade might have helped matters , but he's held back by a rather weak script . It's easy to see why producer Val Lewton was attracted to this project as he was usually associated with these sort of shadowy noirs in the early ' 40s . Some good early direction by Mark Robson is a plus factor . Summing up : neat little thriller , somewhat ahead of its time in style and content .


Text2: There Must Be Complete Submission To The Master Race ! ( Some Spoilers ) We already see there's been a slaughter in the little Norwegian town of Trollness as a German military scout plane lands there to check out what happened . The head Nazi in town Capt . Hauptmann Koenig , Helmut Dantine , is found behind his desk with a self inflected bullet wound in his skull . This obviously in an attempt by the Captain to prevent himself from being taken alive by the rebellious Norwegians and made to face the music . It's then that we get this almost two hour flashback to what lead up to this mindless slaughter of what looks like the entire town and the German garrison in it . Capt . Koenig felt that his ability to lead man in battle had been squandered by his higher up in the German Military High Command by being put in this little nothing town on the Northen Norwegian coast . Wanting to see action on the Russian Front the Captain was always turned down by his superiors from being stationed there . This made Captain Koeing very pied off but unable to take it out on those who screwed him , the German Military High Command , he took it out on the local peaceful Norwegians . Capt . Koenig abuse of the people of Trollness lead them to go so far as getting involved with the British in having them , through he Royal Navy , get loads of arms ammunition and explosives in order to drive the hated Germans out . But what they really needed most was the will to do it , drive the Germans out of town , and be willing to suffer the consequences . When the and the people of Trollness just had their fill of Capt . Koenig and his men they lead by Norwegian freedom fighter Gunnar Brogge , Errol Flynn , broke open the boxes of guns and ammunition that they got from the British and planned to have the German run out of town once and for all . It's wasn't until after Gunner's girlfriend Karen Stensgard , Ann Sheridan , was assaulted and raped , off camera , by a horny German soldier who had the hots for her for some time that he finally got it , and the men and women of the town , all together and revolted against the Germans . It's when Gunnar himself and the leaders of Trollness were rounded up and forced to dig their own graves by the Germans that had the townspeople lead by the peace loving father of Karen Dr . Stensgard , Walter Huston , and town towns ultra-passive Paster Aalesen , Richard Prasen , take to the streets . What's makes "" Edge of Darkness "" a cut above your average war-time propaganda movie is that it keeps the action off the screen until the last fifteen or so minutes . When the fighting finally breaks out the good guys , the freedom fighting Norwegians , are for the most part the ones who get the worst of it by the much better armed and disciplined German troops . What makes the Norwegians succeed is that their more then willing to die , unlike the Germans , for both their ideals and freedoms . The Norwegians use human wave and suicide tactics , totally disregarding their lives and safety , like attacking the Germans with live hand grenades , exploding themselves together with the German troops , in order to drive the hated Germans out of Trolless . An irony in the movie is that the two Quisling in it Kasper Torgerson , Charles Dingle , and is nephew Johann Stensgrad , John Beal , Karen's and Dr . Stensgard brother and son die different death one fighting against the Nazis and the other sucking up to them . Johann having a change of heart risks and eventually gives his life alerting the Norwegian freedom fighters , lead by Gunnar Brogge , that the Germans are waiting in an ambush that they set up for them . Kasper survives the slaughter of Trollness only to get shot , as he rants and raves like a lunatic , by the very Germans whom he sold his people and country out to .

For example , movies like Matango or The Mysterians are among my favorite Toho films . And Atragon had Ishiro Honda directing and a cast that included several familiar and solid actors .

835,"Text1: Disturbing Disturbing horror film about a weird signal that has disrupted all phone , TV and radio service . It changes your mind so that you become rationally homicidal . There is a rhyme and a reason to what you do , it just involves well thought out murder . There is something about the film that gets under your skin since its operating on its own twisted logic . Its a bleak tale that left me feeling very uneasy . To be honest its not perfect , some of the performances are weak and the narrative isn't all there ( I can't explain it with having to explain a great deal ) but it still manages to have an affect on you . Clearly its geared to be seen on TV where the early video nasty ( or is this something happening somewhere else ? ) segues into a weird pattern that will make you wonder if your TV has fritzed out . It hasn't but the world in the film has . One of the more unique horror films of late . Worth a look if you like horror films .


Text2: The Big . 22 Rifle for Christmas marks an initial "" Dragnet "" holiday offering Christmas cheer has been emphasized all these years on radio , television , and most especially , the movies despite attempts to have more dysfunctional families in these holiday staples recently . For "" Dragnet "" s initial attempt at doing a holiday episode , however , they focused on a tragedy . First done on radio taking place on the date that was also the name of the broadcast day-December 22 which was the airdate in 1949 - "" The Big . 22 Rifle for Christmas "" was later filmed for the second television season before airing on December 18 , 1952 . In both , Joe Friday ( Jack Webb ) and his partner ( Barton Yarborough as Ben Romero on radio , Herb Ellis as Frank Smith on TV ) investigate a missing child with blood residue and a bullet being the clues in his backyard . Another child who he played with is also later missing . I'll stop there and say besides Webb the other performer who appeared in both the radio and TV version here was William Johnstone as one of the boys ' father . ( Interesting note : His surname was Morheim on radio and Martin on TV . ) Both versions were compellingly presented but there were some noticeable differences . Like on radio , the partner talked to one of the boys while here it's Friday meaning Ellis doesn't do much here . There's also one visual addition : as Johnstone slams his door , a Christmas ornament from a wreath falls and breaks . Most chilling in both versions is the last line from Joe : "" Don't get a kid a gun for Christmas . "" I'm sure even the N . R . A can't disagree on that ! With that said , "" The Big . 22 Rifle for Christmas "" episode of Dragnet explores just how traumatic childhood tragedy can really be though at least here some forgiveness is visited to the parties involved . . . P . S . I have to mention that Olan Soule , who played Ray Pinker here , had acted on stage in my birthtown of Chicago before going on radio in 1933 .

836,"Text1: The best movie in a long , long time . I knew nothing of Christopher McCandless or the book of his life or even anything about this movie until I was sitting in the cinema . The only thing I knew is that Sean Penn was directing and having been very impressed with his gut-wrenching , if incredibly downbeat , The Pledge I was pretty much guaranteed to like this film . My guess turned out to be extremely correct . Alexander Supertramp ( that's Emile Hirsch as McCandless folks ) is a man with no attachments . Having been raised in a loveless household by parents who only wish for him to ' or-din-ary ' things he entertains them as far as graduating college but escapes to the country as soon as the diploma is in his hands . His dream is to explore the land with no ID , no money and no chance of being found by those who might want to interfere with his mission of reaching peaceful seclusion in a remote corner of Alaska . Along the way he touches many lives , some brief , some profound and gains experience and character that some might never have even if they lived to a hundred . Sean Penn's photography and affection for nature give this film an overall gorgeous look . It is surely one of the most uniquely composed films of the year . He reminds me a lot of Clint Eastwood as an actor who can also direct fine movies and encourage impressive performances out of his cast . Pretty much everybody here is on top form , even Vince Vaughn manages to shake off the taint of those tawdry ' frat pack ' comedies and play a genuine character for once . But Hal Holbrook as old Ron Franz really is a standout . I've never seen a more heartfelt or touching performance in so long . If he doesn't earn an Academy Award come Oscar-time then there ain't no justice in the world . I think it's great that Sean Penn brought Holbrook ( now 82 ) back for such an important and thought-provoking role . If you don't shed a tear for him then you have no soul . Don't con yourself out of a good movie . It may have a limited release but Into the Wild is a film worth taking time out to see . Since I live in the UK , the story of Christopher McCandless ( which appears to be some sort of true urban legend in America ) is not well known here . I guess that having no expectations of the film made me enjoy it on the right level . Definitely something I will be tracking down on HD DVD when it's released . PSI broke my tooth while watching this movie . Just ordinary chewing gum took a big chip out of one of my molars .


Text2: Very important point . . . . . . but unsubtle , ungracefully and inelegantly made . But maybe now in a time of ignorance and superficiality such brazen tactics are the only way to make us understand . Perhaps Moore's critics don't understand that there is no REAL truth . Covering something from all angles , be it a war , an argument or a misunderstanding doesn't lead to pure truth , only confusion . It's no secret that Moore has an agenda with this film . And I agreed with it long before I saw it . The point is President Bush must not be re-elected . And Moore gives us hundreds of reasons why . However it's the manipulation of the editing and arranging of montages that prevent the film from having any real dignity or class . Sure there is a sense of humor and huge understanding of American politics ( you MUST pay attention to every last word ) but Moore's point is too biased to really connect with me . Not that I think Bush deserves any sympathy or a second ( or 1 , 345 , 456th ) chance . It's just that his intentions come across too forcefully . Yes , the war in Iraq is unjust and the biggest lie and waste of human life since the Vietnam catastrophe . And all for what ? For money , nothing more than paper . If we ever come through this will we trust the Government again ? Most ominously not . After watching this film will you ever trust the Government again ? I promise you . . . you won't ! There are some powerful scenes , a woman breaking down in tears reading a letter from her dead son who died in Iraq for Bush's greed , every Senator Moore meets refusing to sign their children up for the Army while poor black kids from the projects willingly sign up , the charred bodies of US soldiers being dragged through the streets in Iraq . But the most effective part of the film was also the most ingenious . The opening to Fahrenheit plays the sounds of planes crashing into the WTC on a black screen . Powerful effects without the use of images at all . Why ? We've seen it so many time we need not see it again . Because terrorism is blind . Out of respect for people sensitive for such images being exploited yet again . And to heighten our awareness of the horror of just screaming and panic and the cheapening of human life . There are parts of this film that will rile you up and enrage you , be it the skillful arranging of facts or the ignorant bystander calling the woman crying over her dead son ' staged ' . Sadly though , it wanders off the point in the middle and kind of sags . If it had been leaner then I wouldn't have gotten so impatient . But as it stands Fahrenheit is an unapologetic firestorm designed to rip right through the Whitehouse and the Senate . With any luck it will . We may not ever trust any new administration but we'll NEVER be fooled again . Lesson might be learned . But at what price ?

837,"Text1: A poor reception for ' Deception ' . I saw this short drama at the 1998 Cinema Muto festival in Pordenone ; they screened a print from the Museum of Modern Art with the original intertitles missing . IMDb's synopsis is accurate . This is very much a Victorian drama , with morality ditto . I was deeply annoyed by one sequence : when the husband finally makes good and sells one of his paintings , he goes to the conservatory ( where he believes his wife is working to support him ) to tell her the good news . When he realises that she doesn't work there , and that she lied to him . . . get this , now . . . he self-righteously resolves to LEAVE her . This despite the fact that she has been supporting him while he dilly-dallied with his paints and palettes . That's another thing I disliked about this movie : the husband allows his wife to support him so he can spend his time painting . Plenty of artistic types have managed to get ' real ' jobs while seeking the muse on their time off and at weekends , so why couldn't this artist do likewise ? ' The Deception ' is thoroughly a product of its era , but even in that era - - when the husband was unquestionably expected to support the wife , rather than the other way round - - it must have been less than fully satisfying . My rating for this : , mostly for the production design , and for Billy Bitzer's usual superb photography .


Text2: Acidic Hasidic foolabout . Hester Street , in Manhattan's Lower East Side , was where many immigrant Jews settled in the last decades of the nineteenth century and early decades of the twentieth . There's even an excellent film , ' Hester Street ' by Joan Micklin Silver , about that time and place . Although the term ' ghetto ' might be too harsh in this case , there were the usual problems one would expect to encounter when a lot of impoverished people are crowded into a small area . ' A Gesture Fight in Hester Street ' is clearly a staged event , shot in a film studio rather than the eponymous street . It's also one of those ghastly attempts at ethnic humour which were so widespread at the time . Two actors , costumed and heavily made-up as Hasidic Jews ( with crepe beards ) , have an altercation which rapidly escalates into a fight . The alleged humour here - - and the explanation of that odd phrase ' gesture fight ' - - is due to the fact that they begin the fight by waving their fingers at each other and poking each other , rather than the more forthright tactic of swinging their fists . I've seen a few other early films ( ' Cohen Saves the Flag ' , for one ) which depict the stereotype that Jews fight dirty , and that Jews fight in an unorthodox ( no pun intended ) manner which is less honest than the way ' real ' men would fight . I suppose that a lot of people laughed at ' A Gesture Fight in Hester Street ' when it was originally exhibited in nickel odious , I mean nickelodeons . I didn't laugh at all . I would rate this movie Zero , but just to be polite I'll rate it 1 in 10 . Since this movie has no actual footage of Hester Street ( nor its inhabitants ) in 1900 , its historic significance is nil .

Text2: A Brutal-Yet-Touching Film For a martial arts picture , "" Unleashed "" was above average because it had some heart and soul to it . . . . . not just people beating the crap out of one another for two straight hours . However , be wary of those who claim this isn't an action film . That's not true : there is a lot of action , quite a bit of brutality and profanity , mostly by Bob Hoskins ' character "" Bart "" in this movie . Hoskins plays profane , nasty slave-owner who has locked up and trained "" Danny "" ( Jet Li ) to be the ultimate fighting machine . Once Danny is "" unleashed "" ( literally ) he's a killer and helps the gangster Bart in his criminal work . Then , in a moment of further greed , Hoskins agrees to enter his man in a death match with a lot of money at stake . That match turns out to be a farce with Danny winning in a matter of seconds . The other promoter wants a rematch , and with more entertainment . In the meantime , however , Danny escapes his captors and winds up at the house of an older blind American , "" Sam , "" played by Morgan Freeman . He and his 18-year-old daughter "" Natalie "" ( Kelly Condon ) befriend young Danny , slowly bringing him out of his "" animal "" state . Everyone discovers Danny has some very human characteristics and is basically a nice , gentle guy . The family helps uncover that through music ( piano playing , to be exact ) . These are all touching scenes . But then - and this is almost a clich√© in these kind of films - the bad guy comes back , snatches him away and his former bad life comes back . . . . except Danny is a changed man . How he can get out of this latest predicament and what happens to this new "" adopted "" family , takes up the rest of the story . That last part has the same thing : ultra-violent and touching scenes . Jet Li does an excellent job in here , not only displaying his amazing physical talents but also showing us he has warmth in his face and heart .

He has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear , only to have that object re-materialize in a different location . But there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesn't succeed . After a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding , Professor Steiner decides to test his machine on himself . As expected , things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill . In hindsight , maybe it wasn't such a good idea to re-watch The Projected Man in the same week I watched The Fly , Return of the Fly , and Curse of the Fly . There seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period . I'm not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for The Projected Man , but much of it is so similar to the Fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence . However , The Projected Man isn't even nearly as good as the worst of the Fly trilogy . Besides being terribly unoriginal , The Projected Man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie . A big issue I have is with Bryant Haliday in the lead .

842,"Text1: It's All In The Mind Erich Von Stroheim had three ' French ' periods , the late 30s , late 40s and late 50s and this is from the first period - roughly 1937-1940 . It would perhaps be foolish to equate it with two other films from that first period , Les Disparus de St Agil and La Grande Illusion , but neither is it chopped liver . Pierre Chenal is an underrated director who worked with Von Stroheim several times and was still turning out interesting stuff - The Killer Knows The Score , Dangerous Games - at the end of his career and this is a neat little entry which is fairly representative of French cinema at the time . At 80 minutes it equates to the Hollywwod ' program ' picture or the ' quota quickies ' produced in England , solid fare designed to fill the bottom half of a double bill supporting an ' A ' picture ( which is why they were also known as ' B ' pictures - or even one equal half of a double bill of two ' B ' pictures ( let's face it , moviegoers got a lot for their money in those days ; two feature films , cartoon , newsreel plus a one or two reel ' magazine ' , The March Of Time , Pathe Pictorial , Look At Life ; how come WE accept one feature , 50 commercials and a couple of trailers ) . This one sees Von Stroheim as a telepathist working in a plush Parisian nite-club ( telepathy was a not-so-elaborate con which was code-based so that the usually blindfolded maestro relied on an Assistant to say ' I'm holding a silver object ' or some such which would be the code for a wristwatch , etc . Incredibly it actually flourished in England up to the fifties via a husband-and-wife act The Piddingtons ) where one night an old enemy turns up by chance . Naturally he has to be killed and Von Stroheim is up to the task and having done so he bribes one of the ' hostesses ' at the club to swear he spent the night with her . Louis Jouvet , in charge of the murder investigation , isn't buying this for birdseed but lacking hard evidence he persuades a colleague , Albert Prejean , to seduce the girl and get at the truth ( this , of course , would be inadmissible today ) . That's about it but Chenal has a sure eye and keeps the action rolling along and no way are Jouvet and Von Stroheim ever going to be less than watchable .


Text2: Vent Act Of 1945 The Michael Redgrave segment stands head and shoulders above the others and is the one thing that most people remember about this Ealing Studios release that ventured into new territory for a studio associated with comedy laced with occasional melodrama ( It Always Rains On Sunday ) . It was also an early sighting of the portmanteau movie - soon to be supplemented by Easy Money , Quartet , Trio , Encore and from Fox in Hollywood O'Henry's Full House , We're Not Married , etc . The Redgrave sequence epitomises the Dark end of the spectrum whilst the Naunton Wayne / Basil Radford section represents the lighter element with the Sally Ann Howes and Googie Withers segments occupying the middle ground . I'm prepared to believe that in 1945 it was reasonably scary though European audiences had just lived through a horror that eclipsed anything here .

He has a tremendous screen presence and carries the film , even though he's off-screen for much of it . "" Harvey "" is a sweet movie with a distinct strain of melancholia running through it . It's more about the way one wishes the world could be rather than the way it actually is .

846,"Text1: Very good adaptation of the tale even if it shows its stage bound origins . This version of Jekyll and Hyde has its origins in a stage production of the novel . This is part of the films flaw in that the acting seems to have been pulled right off the stage rather than coming from real life . This shouldn't put you off from seeing this movie since its quite good and is possibly one of the finer adaptations of the story . Sticking closer to the book , or so it seems , it tries to unravel the weird story with Jeykll and Hyde taking up less of the limelight . This is two friends trying to hash out whats going on . Its a refreshing take on the tale and adds nice shading to everything thats going on . Out side of the stage acting that some people use this film really has no flaws other than a bit too much of the chroma-key or blue screen effects that it uses to supplement its backgrounds . There's nothing wrong with it , but it seems to have been over used sand at times I felt like I was watching a video game rather than a movie . Ultimately this is a film to put on your must see list especially if you want to see a good version of a literary classic .


Text2: not very interesting story of kids behaving badly Based on a true story movie is less interesting than the controversy surrounding it - the murder case is due to go to trial at any moment and people are afraid the movie would taint the jury pool . The ads say based on the story of the youngest person on the FBI most wanted list . Truth is its a lot of young guns behaving badly in the story of a drug dealer who killed the brother of someone who owed him money in order to make a point . Twenty minutes in its clear that these are a bunch of not very bright people doing not very interesting bad things . If there had been no controversy it would have been straight to DVD , where we could have forgotten it even faster .

848,"Text1: Decent B picture with good work by Rondo Hatton . The distinctively featured character star Rondo Hatton - his face disfigured by the disease acromegaly - gets a starring role as a revenge-crazed murderer dubbed "" The Creeper "" by the press . Once a handsome if hot-tempered football star by the name of Hal Moffat , a lab accident happened to mar his appearance . Now he's out to strike back at those he blames for his situation , while forming a tender friendship with a blind girl , Helen Paige ( the wonderfully beautiful Jane Adams ) , who is therefore not bound by any fear of his appearance . Were it not for Hattons ' presence ( sadly , this was his last picture ) , this would still be watchable but pretty forgettable . The plot is pretty standard . Supporting performances are acceptable , and the music has a familiar ring to it . There are also points , such as the gin rummy sequence , where the picture ought not to be taken too seriously . It's well paced ( running just under an hour long ) and reasonably entertaining , but Hattons ' poignant presence makes it something different . This is no one-dimensionally evil boogeyman , but a man blinded by the same temper that afflicted him in better days . One can get the sense of the kind and sensitive person that Hatton was . While it may have been unfortunate that the movie business was too quick to exploit Hattons ' appearance , there's no doubt that he made his mark in cinema . People continue to remember him today , right down to the naming of an award - marking achievement in horror research - after him . Rest in peace , Rondo Hatton .


Text2: 27 Dresses was a pleasant enough viewing for Valentine's Day I have to confess , I wasn't intending to go see a movie on Valentine's Day since "" Lost "" and "" Survivor "" were on TV tonight and I only picked 27 Dresses because the other movies on the list for the theatre we were attending were either ones I wasn't interested in or they only had one showing in the afternoon . The movie itself was a little funny and sometimes hilarious so it was a mostly pleasant experience though I did perk up a little bit when leads Katherine Heigl and James Marsden did a karaoke to Elton John's "" Benny and the Jets "" . Comic actress Judy Greer did have some really funny lines as Heigl's sidekick though not enough to kick things into high gear . Even so , me and my friend had a pretty good time watching 27 Dresses .

849,"Text1: Entertaining enough , but lacking . Bonnie and Clyde was a big hit in 1967 , and I don't doubt that Hollywood's great money-spinner , Roger Corman , had that on his mind when he decided to direct a film based on another of America's great crime legends . The story of "" Machine Gun Totting Ma Barker "" is a well known one ; I won't profess to know the ins and outs of it , but the basics are common knowledge . The film would only appear to be loosely based on the classic story , however , and Corman seemed keener to put the focus on the situation within the group rather than actually telling a story . The plot focuses on Ma Barker ; a strong matriarch with four sons . The story takes place within depression era USA and Ma and her sons find themselves with little to live on and so turn to crime . The troupe carries out robberies , commits murder and does other such illegal acts and it soon gets dubbed as a ' crime spree ' . However , more interesting than that is how the group itself works ; perversion is rife as we get to witness things such as incest and homosexuality within the group . The film is rather entertaining throughout , but for me ; something about it just doesn't work . Corman's directing style is very cold and despite excellent performances from the cast - the film fails to be involving and nobody really steps up to take the ' antihero ' role effectively . It's a good job , therefore , that the film is entertaining for most of the duration as there isn't much in the way of distraction when it comes to the less entertaining parts . Corman has got himself together a good cast of actors ; chief among them obviously being Shelly Winters . Winters looks decidedly less glamorous than in previous performances - but fits into her role here very well indeed and really convincing that she is the character she is portraying . The rest of the cast is fine too , featuring good performances from the likes of Don Stroud and Bruce Dern , as well an early performance from the great Robert DeNiro . There's not a great deal of highlights in the film ; but Pat Hingle's role is entertaining and it all boils down to a very well working final shootout scene . Overall , this is decent enough ; but I'm not surprised that it hasn't gone down as a great film and would only recommend it to those who happen across a copy .


Text2: Some good ideas in a rather dull film This film is often considered to be a rip off of The Omen and / or Rosemary's Baby ; however , I think it's unfair to label it as such as while it does focus on similar themes and both films may well have been an influence ; if you were to consider this film a rip off , then you'd pretty much have to consider every film about the birth of the anti-Christ to be a rip off of The Omen and / or Rosemary's Baby . That being said , I don't want to give Damned in Venice too much credit ; as while it has some ideas of it's own , they're mostly not very good ones ! As the title suggests , the film is set in Venice ; although this doesn't really have a lot of influence on the plot , but it is always a nice setting . The film focuses on Mark ; a blind boy who begins having strange visions that seem to point to a looming disaster . Naturally , nobody believes him ; including his sister who also happens to be his carer . Even when people start dying the kid is not believed , but things take a turn for the worse again when the man from his visions turns up and impregnates his sister . . . This film features a very odd brother and sister relationship , which is even worse considering the brother is blind . The brother is extremely vulnerable , and the sister ( his carer ) not only seems not to care , but it appears as if just spending time in the same room with this poor kid is a chore ! Not that I can blame her though . . . he is seriously irritating . Some of the acting actually isn't bad ; but the film does really suffer from some extremely poor dubbing . The brother and sister's voices especially are very irritating and it makes them difficult to care about . The main problem with the film is that it's rather boring . There certainly are some good ideas on display , but it's just too slow and the first hour especially is boring . Thankfully , the film starts to pick up a bit in the final third ; although by then it is just a tad too late . We do get treated to a few good death scenes , however ( one in particular that really stands out ) and the final twist is fairly clever . Overall , this is not a great film by any means ; it has a few good moments but not enough to warrant tracking it down .

Sheldon a good writer , but it shows he has an ear for what seem to work , be it a book , or in this case , a screenplay . Under the direction of Irving Reis , this comedy is still fun to watch after all these years . The stars , of course , are the main reasons for watching "" The Boxer and the Bobby Soxer "" . The film's premise is about the infatuation of a impressionable teen ager with a much older man . The object of that affection is a playboy who appears to be unsuitable for the girl . The contrast between the older man and the young girl creates a lot of funny situations . To make matters worse , the sister of the young girl is a judge , who sees right through the roguish Richard Nugent and wants him to leave the girl alone , but figures that surely her sister will soon get bored with the man . Myrna Loy does wonders with her role as Margaret Turner . Cary Grant brings his natural elegance to the role of Richard Nugent ; just watch him in the picnic competition . Shirley Temple is a sweet Susan , the girl infatuated with Richard . In minor roles , Rudy Vallee and Ray Collins are perfectly cast . In a couple of scenes in the film we see Richard Nugent in shining armor , as both sisters take turns in imagining him her hero . Only the right one will be rewarded .

851,"Text1: House of authentic , ingenious horror ! ( SPOILERS included ) This film surely is the best Amicus production I've seen so far ( even though I still have quite a few to check out ) . The House that Dripped Blood is a horror-omnibus ? an anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious , hellish house in the British countryside . A common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate tales ? Peter Duffel's film wisely doesn't pay too much attention to that . It simply handles about a Scotland Yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that , he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before . All four stories in this film are of high quality-level and together , they make a perfect wholesome . High expectations are allowed for this film , since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch ! Yes , the same Bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone ' Psycho ' ? We're also marking Peter Duffel's solid and very professional debut as a director . The four stories ? chapters if you will ? in the House that Dripped Blood contain a good diversity in topics , but they're ( almost ) equally chilling and eerie . Number one handles about a horror-author who comes to the house , along with his wife , in order to find inspiration for his new book . This starts out real well , but after a short while , his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination . The idea in this tale isn't exactly original ? but it's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising . The second story stars ( Hammer ) horror-legend Peter Cushing as a retired stockbroker . Still haunted by the image of an unreachable and long-lost love , he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her . Cushing is a joy to observe as always and ? even though the topic of Wax Museums isn't new ? this story looks overall fresh and innovating . This chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock-moments and there's a constant tense atmosphere . It's a terrific warm-up for what is arguably the BEST story : number 3 . Another legendary actor in this one , as Christopher Lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father . He's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world . Not without reason , since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo . Besides great acting by Lee and the remarkable performance of Chloe Franks as the spooky kid , this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere ! The devilish undertones in this story , along with the creepy sound effects of thunder , make this story a must for fans of authentic horror . The fourth and final story , in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire-cloak he wears , is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility , but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that . There's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co-star Christopher Lee in the Dracula series ! Most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous Ingrid Pitt ! The cult-queen from ' The Vampire Lovers ' certainly is one of the many highlights in the film ? her cleavage in particular . No doubt about it ? The House that Dripped Blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans . I truly believe that , with a bit of mood-settling preparations , this could actually be one of the few movies that'll terrify you and leave a big impression . Intelligent and compelling horror like it should be ! Highly recommended . One extra little remark , though : this film may not ? repeat MAY NOT under any circumstances be confused with ' The Dorm that Dripped Blood ' . This latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film , except for the title it stole .


Text2: Work that Body , Kill your Brain ! This is quite possibly the most retarded 80's slasher ever realized , but how can you be harsh on a film that features non-stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises , taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits ? Prior to being a horror film , "" Aerobicide "" is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids , silicons and other body-stimulating fitness products . If you'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80's tunes , there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left . Plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health-freaks with a big safety pin ( yeah ? ) . The film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun-bathing device . Several years later people turn up dead in the same spa . You don't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there's a link between the murders and the burning incident , now do you ? Investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer ( and Charles Napier look-alike ! ) and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80's beauty I've ever seen ! Looking through the credits , her name's Dianne Copeland apparently , and she didn't do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile Troma-movie called "" Surf Nazis Must Die "" . What a wasted opportunity ! She may not have been a great actress , but she sure had two other BIG advantages that would help her move upwards in show business . The amount of gore and the quality of the make-up effects are nothing special , neither . We're treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh . The plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable , but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore , anyway . "" Aerobicide "" ( a . k . a . "" Killer Workout "" ) is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night , but nevertheless feel like watching a film ! It actually would make a terrific double-feature with "" Death Spa "" . Both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes ? and both films are pretty dumb .

Humor rules this episode with the following plot devices : Dean takes hits at the expense of his Impala . Bella becomes Sam and Dean's problem . The Bella , Dean rivalry begins , and the sexual tension starts . Sam has sexual tension of his own and takes a hit for the mission , while Dean calls Sam a cougar hound . ( the best comic part of the show ) Sam reminds the women of her late husband . The show has the usual twist , and different endings . Bella will most definitely return for a later show . I like this show . On a more serious note Sam and Dean are starting to fight with Dean's character flaw of not caring about him self hero mode at the expense of others .

This one about a New York publicist trapped in a phone booth by an unknown sniper depends on how much you like Colin Farrell as an actor for how much millage you can take from it . I , myself enjoy Collin's work so I enjoyed this film . Not tremendously enjoyed , but enjoyed all the same . I found it to be taunt and a bit suspenseful thanks in no small part to Larry Cohen's writing . That guy hugely under-rated . But the ending is what marred the whole film for me .

Text2: "" Writers with luggage locker keys do it ! "" If ever there was a success story for the ' 70's , it surely was the career of actor John Alderton . After quitting the role of teacher Bernard Hedges in ' Please Sir ! ' in 1971 ( though he popped up in three early episodes of the spin-off ' The Fenn Street Gang ' ) , he went on to appear in a string of hit shows , including ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' , ' My Wife Next Door ' , ' Wodehouse Playhouse ' , ' Thomas & Sarah ' , and of course this . ' The Upchat Line ' was a witty seven-part Thames sitcom written by Keith Waterhouse , author of ' Billy Liar ' . The lead character , Mike Upchat , shares similarities with young Fisher , namely in that he has a weakness for girls , and for telling the truth . Upchat said he was a writer , but had had nothing published ( "" My publishers are unreasonable . They won't publish a title unless there's a book to go with it . "" . ) . He was homeless , and kept his few possessions in a luggage locker in Marylebone Station . Being blessed with ' the gift of the gab ' , getting accommodation for the night was a breeze for him . All he had to do was find a pretty girl , use his chat-up technique , and bingo , he'd be in her bed . In the opening scene of the first episode , he is seen leaving Buckingham Palace of all places . He goes to a party and after spending the night with Wanda Ventham , discovers that her husband - a Black Belt in karate - has come home unexpectedly early . In another , Upchat has the staff of a city department store believing he has worked there for years , whereas in reality he only started the job that morning . In yet another , he goes to hospital and everyone takes him for a doctor . The show depended for much of its appeal on Alderton's charm . Upchat could smooth talk his way out of any difficult situation , using lies to impress attractive women and , when in danger of being found out , using lies to get himself out of trouble . His lack of social responsibilities made his lifestyle one to be envied . Alderton played a similar character in ' Sprout ' , a comedy pilot from 1974 by future ' Shelley ' creator Peter Tilbury . Upchat's on-screen conquests included Gabrielle Drake , Sue Lloyd , Susan Jameson and Liza Goddard . Sexist ? Absolutely . But undeniably amusing . The catchy ragtime signature tune was by ' Wombles ' composer / performer Mike Batt . The humour was unusually sophisticated by I . T . V . standards ( hailing from the era of ' Oh No Its Selwyn Froggitt ' and ' The Rag Trade ' ) , and felt more like a B . B . C . - 2 series . Nevertheless , it was a ratings hit , and , by rights , should have run and run . But there were behind the scenes problems . Being a perfectionist , Alderton had a habit of refusing to do scripts he did not approve of , and would return for rewrites those he was unhappy with . When he did this on ' The Upchat Line ' , Waterhouse was livid . The author made his anger public : "" He ( Alderton ) changed so much in one episode that I considered taking my name off it . "" . His next words came as a bitter blow to fans : "" I won't write for him again . I never realised how bloody awkward he can be . "" . With Alderton out of the show , the search was on for a new ' Mike Upchat ' . Whoever took on the role needed to be funny , sexy and charming . They eventually settled on Robin Nedwell , then fresh from a long stint on L . W . T . ' s ' Doctor ' series in which he played ' Dr . Duncan Waring ' . As if in acknowledgment of the change in lead actor , the show was retitled ' The Upchat Connection ' .

The plot itself is intriguing enough to hold the attention and revolves around a cop maimed in the line of duty wanting to set himself up for a murder so that his wife will cash in on his life insurance . It's a fairly clever thriller and even though it's a HBO production featuring sex , violence and swearing these elements don't overshadow the plot unlike many other HBO films that drown in excessive violence . That scene in the court at the end made me wince


Text2: There's Such A Thing As Being Too Realistic This might sound ridiculous but it wasn't until 1991 that I got into De Niro , Keitel and Scorsese in a big way . I'd just seen the classic TAXI DRIVER and eagerly got my dad to tape MEAN STREETS off Sky television . Unfortunately I thought I'd either given my dad a bad tape or the video hadn't been tuned into the TV station properly since the picture quality was very poor and everything was filmed in a sickly red colour and that's just the bits I could make out because for most of the movie the contrast was terrible with everything being dimly lit . It wasn't until a couple of nights ago when I saw MEAN STREETS on network TV that I realised that the poor picture quality wasn't anything to do with duff videotapes or out of tune video recorders - It was down to the fact that the original print suffers from some terrible lighting and cinematography that gives the impression that the movie was made on 8mm by a bunch of twelve year old boysThat's bad enough but what brings the film down ( And I noticed this on first viewing in 1991 ) is that Scorsese has forgotten to write a plot to his screenplay . I think Martin Scorsese is god where making movies is concerned but not even he can escape criticism by making a movie that goes nowhere . For the most part MEAN STREETS resembles those Harry Endfield characters The Scousers with New York accents "" You alright Johnny Boy ? "" "" You asking me if I'm alright ? "" "" Yeah I am . What the f you gonna do about it ? "" It's like this all the way through the running time up until the last ten minutes when Marty finally realises he's got to introduce an incident in order to finish the film The acting from Harvey Keitel is totally convincing while De Niro is superb ( Something that can't be said for most of his recent performances ) but by writing a low concept hyper realistic screenplay Scorsese has effectively ruined the movie in its conception . Ask yourself this : If the driving force behind the movie wasn't Martin Scorsese would you have regarded MEAN STREETS so highly ?

Text2: Orphans of the storm talkie That was the story which DW Griffith had already transferred to the screen in the silent era . The great American director transposed Adolphe d'Ennery's tear-jerker , one of the many melodramas which thrived in the French nineteenth century , during the revolution , which led the scriptwriters to staggering scenes where Danton himself saved the heroine from the guillotine . Maurice TOurneur ( Jack's father ) was more faithful to the original novel . His movie compares favorably to Griffith's , but Ren√©e Saint-Cyr does not equal Lilian Gish though . The orgy is at least as impressive ( and as risqu√© for the time ) as in the silent work . Best part comes from Yvette GUilbert , the hateful shrew , La Frochard , who forces poor blind Louise to beg in the street . Tourneur ' s directing and pictures are better than the incredible story which accumulates the coincidences all along Henriette's and Louise's martyrdom : La Frochard rocking her dead son ( a giant ) , Louise teaching Andr√© to pray in a church , and the ( female ) prisoners leaving for the colonies are scenes which can still grab today's audience , provided that they love melodramas of course .

Text2: One of the great "" giant bug "" movies of the 1950's . Scientist Gerald Deemer ( Leo G .

The formula causes animals to grow at an accelerated rate , and wouldn't you know it , a giant tarantula escapes and scours the Southwestern desert , devouring some hapless victims and terrorizing all . I enjoyed this movie because it remains convincing instead of descending into laugh-ability as I'm sure some of the other "" giant bug "" movies of the period did . The special effects actually work , and the film is refreshingly serious when it could have turned into blatant camp . I thought it was genuinely chilling , with likable characters and good pacing . John Agar is an engaging hero , and Mara Corday fits the mold of other female leads from the period - brainy instead of being merely decorative . The added subplot that shows what the formula does to human beings is a decent bonus - the makeup effects turn out to be pretty good , especially as they relate to the character of Deemer . A certain gravely-voiced film legend , in one of his earliest feature film appearances , can be seen right at the end of the film , as the jet squadron leader .

He tries to end the affair , but the woman will have none of that . She sets the house on fire killing his wife and child . Burned beyond recognition , the man vows revenge against his former lover . Overall , Pyro is a nice little horror / thriller . The plot , although predictable , is generally well paced and only gets bogged down by the love story on one or two brief occasions . It's the predictability that keeps me from rating Pyro much higher . There are a few chills to be had like the scene where the woman runs in fear down a deserted street at night , afraid that her disfigured lover is about the catch-up with her . The acting is a notch or two above what I have seen in other early Spanish horror films . Both Barry Sullivan and Martha Hyer give excellent performances in the lead roles . Hyer , in particular , is wonderful as the scheming , murderous ex-lover . Finally , the burn make-up is effectively creepy . It's the stuff of nightmares .

Using rather obvious ploys ( like phony beards and wigs , not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant / secret agent ) , they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills . This fantastic tale might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists ; unfortunately , the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H . G .

I was so desperate for more Rex Steele I had to watch the DVD a couple more times in a row . Where is the rest of this ? I would gladly pay to see the remaining 14 chapters of Steele's adventures . The guys involved are some how connected to Pixar who could easily continue their string of hits by putting a Rex Steele feature into the cue . See this film . You will love it . , and a grin from ear to ear .

872,"Text1: Not a perfect film , but very good - Norton's performance is the highlight "" American History X "" is a bold and disturbing movie about family , racism and our own self-perceptions . Its main character is Derek ( Edward Norton ) , a neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from jail to find his younger brother ( Edward Furlong ) descending down the same corrupt path as he once walked . In jail Derek learns a few things about life , and racism , or more appropriately , himself , and after becoming a free man again takes it upon himself to set his brother on the straight and narrow path . "" American History X "" is not a pleasant motion picture . It begins in flashback , as Derek murders two black kids trying to break into his car . His brother , who idolizes Derek and later mimics his lifestyle , witnesses this event . It's a good message about negative influences , along with everything else . Much has been made of the film's controversy and lawsuits . Director Tony Kaye disowned the film after Norton ( allegedly ) re-edited footage to give himself more screen time . Kaye tried to have his name changed on the film credits , but by this time he had already taken out a complaint in several magazines , which are against the rules of the Director's Guild . He was therefore denied the opportunity to credit the work as "" directed by Humpty Dumpty . "" Then , musical band Anti-Hero complained to New Line Cinema ( the film's international distributor ) because one of the Nazi characters featured a tattoo of their band . They later wrote a song , called "" NLC , "" bashing the company . Despite the hard-edged controversy it's still a very good film , above all else extremely well-acted and featuring a gripping storyline ? even if the direction isn't always up to par . Edward Norton is simply superb in his role , showing extremely raw talent a mere two years after his film debut ( in the Richard Gere thriller "" A Primal Fear "" ) . Norton careens between the role of a raging , vicious supremacist and a kindler , gentler version of the same character ; a metamorphosis so convincing it's hard to believe it's just one actor . The rest of the cast is good as well ? Furlong gives the best performance of his career and Beverly D'Angelo and Stacy Keach have strong supporting roles . ( D'Angelo in particular , who portrays a sleazy alcoholic ? a stretch compared to her usual Normal Mom roles in the "" Vacation "" movies . ) "" American History X "" isn't exactly rewarding of all the praise it has been lavished since its release ( mainly from viewers rather than critics , who were less kind ) ? it isn't the best movie of its kind or even a flawless one . The black-and-white photography isn't on the same level , visually , as "" Raging Bull "" or "" Schindler's List . "" The preaching is a bit heavy-handed at times . But it still manages to convey an important lesson and boasts great acting complimented by an ( overall ) impressive , gut-wrenching screenplay . A must-see for all who can stomach its content .


Text2: A pathetic and insultingly childish fantasy set in reality This film has been made dozens of times in other forms . This "" Disney Original "" idea is a complete laugh - if this is considered original , then I'm Abraham Lincoln . And I can't be Abraham Lincoln because I believe he is dead . Trevor Morgan ( you may remember him as the annoying kid from "" Jurassic Park III "" ) plays a complete nerd and mathematical genius who basically lives underneath a school ice hockey stadium . It is there that he constructs magical potions using science and math . However he realizes he's not exactly catching any ladies , so he adopts the persona of "" Chaz "" ( his real name is Charlie ) to woo the ladies - enrolling in school again and becoming a "" bad boy "" who talks back to teachers and looks "" cool . "" News flash : Kids stopped wearing Fonzie-style leather jackets to school in the 1960s . If anything , it's retro . It doesn't make you look cool . You don't gain instant respect by showing up at school with a leather jacket , a comb and a smirk and talking back to teachers . Today , in the age of gangsta rappas and emo , you would be laughed at and ridiculed . "" Chaz "" would become an instant outcast and his plan would backfire . But in "" Genius "" all the kids are friendly white suburbanite offspring and they love The Chaz . They fall victim to his evil ploy to get some girly-action and even the bad boys at school respect him . It would be kind of funny if it weren't so sad to actually think some Disney TV executive greenlit this and thought the concept of a 12-year-old high school graduate living in an underground lab who adapts a new persona of a leather-jacket wearing freak would be successful .

JASON ( 2003 ) ; neither was any good , and this second instalment is , if anything , even worse ! Following the stupid misadventures of a number of fun-loving teens for 90 minutes would test anyone's patience - and , with that in mind , I decided to watch this a day earlier and leave PART III for Friday the 13th itself ( which is actually the only reason I lowered myself to renting such outright trash ! ) . . . While there's plenty of violence ( a couple making out in a bedroom are speared right through - directly ripping off not just Mario Bava's giallo TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE [ 1971 ] but the original Friday itself ! ) , this is mostly relegated to the second half : we have to suffer first through a long-winded prologue ( reprising virtually the entire climax of the first film ) and oodles of exposition in order to pigeon-hole each and every one of the teens ( but , then , a few of them get lost in the shuffle - the irritating geek , for instance , never returns from the night on the town ! ) , plus make perfectly clear ( unless it may go above some particularly feeble-minded audience member's head ) the fact that their camp is situated next to the infamous "" Camp Blood "" ( Brrrr ! ) . Still , the unseen murderer ( outside of the last shot , that is ) device grows tired pretty quickly ( where's the iconic figure of Jason wearing an ice hockey mask , anyway ? ! ) , as does the plot contrivance of isolating individual members of the cast - thus marking them all too obviously as the next victim ( at least , a couple of the girls are attractive and even get to shed their clothes ) ! I guess you can all elicit from this negative review that the slasher subgenre , in my estimation , is about the lowest point in the horror spectrum !


Text2: THE ADVENTURES OF GERARD ( Jerzy Skolimowski , 1970 ) I was pleasantly surprised by this one : Leonard Maltin rates it a BOMB but I found it great fun , if uneven . Skolimowski's first English-language film was actually shot in Cinecitta ' and , in fact , features many Italians in the cast ( all of whom struggle with the literary - and very English - nature of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original ! ) . There's still plenty of amusing detail to savor - the subject matter of the Napoleonic Wars is treated as farce most of the time and , in fact , there's quite a bit of slapstick involved ( to which Skolimowski's technique is happy to oblige via numerous camera tricks , pretty much the sole link here to his early Polish films ) - and , accordingly , all the performances are broadly delineated : Peter McEnery is a pompous yet likable ne'er-do-well hero ; Eli Wallach is a buffoonish ( and gay ) Napoleon ; while Jack Hawkins has a whale of a time ( which , alas , happened very seldom in the films he made following the tragic loss of his voice ) as the flustered leader of a bandit rabble who have adopted novel means of torture and execution , and are even dressed in Klan-type garb ! Apart from asides to the audience , McEnery also engages in a constantly interrupted duel with British officer Mark Burns - with whom he also spars for the affections of beautiful and fiery Spanish countess Claudia Cardinale . John Neville is the Duke of Wellington in his last film for almost 20 years ( when he achieved some latter-day notoriety , in another tongue-in-cheek fantasia no less , with the title role of Terry Gilliam's THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN [ 1988 ] ) . Riz Ortolani contributes a suitably jaunty , yet frequently rousing , score . Unfortunately , some of the film's visual impact was inevitably lost in the pan-and-scan version I watched ( taped off Cable TV ) ; originally shot in Panavision , I wouldn't mind owning this in its proper Aspect Ratio on DVD . . .

Text2: Almost a 10 Autobiographical comedy / drama by Neil Simon . In it a recent widower George Schneider ( James Caan ) meets and falls in love with a recent divorcee Jennie MacLaine ( Marsha Mason ) . He marries her quickly , but realizes he hasn't gotten completely over his first wife . Is her love for him enough to see them through ? This was based on the real troubles Simon had when he married Mason in the early 1970s . He got over them ( not completely though - - they divorced in 1981 ) and wrote "" Chapter Two "" for the stage . I never saw it on the stage but I remember seeing this movie up the theatre back in 1980 . I loved it ( with reservations ) back then and I still love it ( with reservations ) now . The dialogue is virtual non-stop one-liners - - real people don't talk like that but it is fun and entertaining to listen to . The dramatic sequences work well especially with Mason giving her all to what must have been a very difficult role for her to play . She's just tremendous ( and drop-dead gorgeous ) and was understandably nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for this role ( she lost to Sally Field for "" Norma Rae "" ) . The film looks beautiful , moves fairly quickly and there's nice strong support from Joseph Bologna and ( especially ) Valerie Harper . . . but there's one big problem . James Caan . He's a wonderful DRAMATIC actor . . . NOT comedic . He seems very uncomfortable playing a mild-mannered grieving man , and the poor guy has no comedic timing and doesn't know how to tell a joke - - most of his lines fall flat . With a better leading man I might have given it a 10 . As it is this is a strong 9 . Worth catching . . . especially for Mason .

875,"Text1: Norman Catches The Worm ! Mention the name Norman Wisdom to many and the chances are the first thing they think of is of him in that ill-fitting ' gump ' suit , mugging frantically , falling over to the strangulated cry of ' Mr . Grimsdale ! ' . Comedy film fans may make the sign of the cross at his name , but the fact is he was the No . 1 British box office star for well over a decade . There is nothing pretentious about him or his films . You do not need to be ' in ' on the joke because there is nothing to be in on . Now it is very different - unfunny material can make millions for its creators as long as it is perceived to be ' cutting-edge ' . Norman's brand of knockout comedy was old hat even in his hey-day , owing a debt to silent era comics such as Chaplin and Keaton . But he soon put on his own stamp on the genre , finding out what worked for him and what did not . His regular ' stooges ' were Edward Chapman as his boss , the aforementioned ' Mr . Grimsdale ' , and long-faced Jerry Desmonde as the pompous authority figure whose side Norman becomes a thorn in . ' The Early Bird ' was the last time all three appeared together . It came along at a time when British film comedy was becoming less and less family oriented ( look at 1966's ' Doctor In Clover ' and compare it with the earlier Dirk Bogarde ones ) . Norman tried to move with the times by going into colour , and then parted company with his producer Hugh Stewart , who went on to make three pictures with Morecambe and Wise . Norman once more is ' Pitkin ' , this time a milkman for Grimsdale's Dairies , a small-town firm under threat from the much-bigger ' Consolidated Dairies ' . When he finds broken bottles on his round , it amounts to a declaration of war . Consolidated Dairies's top milkman is ' Austin ' ( Brian Pringle ) , and when they confront one another in a deserted street it is like ' High Noon ' all over again . "" Little men like you do not stand a chance ! "" , sneers Austin , before landing a nasty-looking punch to Pitkin's jaw . But when the ' little man ' is Norman , he is in with more than just a chance . Right , that's the premise established . What about the slapstick ? Well , Norman is dragged through Desmonde's garden on an out of control lawnmower , disguises himself as a vicar to gatecrash Desmonde's game of golf with ' The Colonel ' ( John Le Mesurier ) , eats doped apples intended for his horse Nellie ( a sequence more disturbing than all 75 minutes of Roger Corman's ' The Trip ' ) , falls downstairs goodness knows how many times , and manages to nearly demolish Consolidated Dairies's H . Q . No wonder Norman was offered the role of ' Frank Spencer ' before Michael Crawford . Corny ? Yes . But there's nothing wrong with corn . Despite the many fun moments , Norman's popularity was in rapid decline . His next picture - ' Press For Time ' - combined the knockabout stuff with a half-hearted attempt at political satire , and his 1969 offering ' What's Good For The Goose ' saw him shedding the cloth-cap ( along with everything else ) by jumping into bed with Sally Geeson of ' Bless This House ' . Whether you like ' The Early Bird ' depends on whether you like Norman , and to many he is simply is not funny . But he gave a lot of pleasure to an awful of people - including the entire population of Albania - and I suspect his cheap and cheerful movies will still be gracing Saturday afternoons long after the ' cutting-edge ' stuff has been forgotten .

On their latest port of call in the Mediterranean , Duncan and Dick are left stranded when the M . S . Begonia sets sail without them . Dick uses what's left of his money to buy a small motor boat . En route it runs out of petrol . Dick thought it more important to bring along wine than a can of reserve fuel . So now they are stuck in the middle of the Med , their ship nowhere in sight . . . Gail Renard was the only female writer to work on the ' Doctor ' series , and her scripts are no less sexist than those of the men . This one is very good indeed , putting our heroes in a seemingly impossible situation . Nedwell and Davies quarrelling over whose fault it all is is hilarious . Its not quite a two-hander though , as we keep going back to the ship to see how the Purser is coping with the irritating Entertainments Officer , a man with a corny quip for every occasion . Captain Loftus ' dependency on Duncan for ' stomach mixture ' was also a story element of the film ' Doctor In Trouble ' . It does seem unlikely that the M . S . Begonia could locate the doctors so easily , but I expect that Renard had painted herself into a corner with this story . One of the few episodes to boast overseas location filming , by the way . Maybe the expense involved was a contributory factor in ' At Sea ' not being recommissioned . Funniest moment - spotting the M . S .

Then a mysterious stranger by the name of George Spiggot enters his life . Spiggot is The Devil , and in return for Stanley's soul gives him seven wishes . In the first , Moon is an intellectual ( a Welsh one at that ! ) , and tries to sweep Margaret off her feet ( and into his bed ) with clever talk . She cries ' Rape ' ! In the second , he is a millionaire who lavishes expensive presents on Margaret , to whom he is now married . But she is openly sleeping with everyone except him . The third wish sees him as a pop star whom the whole world adores . Alas ' Drimbl Wedge & The Vegetation ' are on the same programme , and Margaret transfers her hero worship to him . The fourth wish occurs when Stanley innocently wonders what Margaret is currently up to . He and Spiggot become flies who buzz around a morgue . The fifth has Stanley and Margaret passionately in love . But she is happily married to another Spiggot lookalike . Stanley details his sixth wish carefully . There must be no men in Margaret's life . He forgets to specify the sex and is turned into a nun . Which means he has one wish left . Or does he ? Though revered now , Stanley Donen's Swinging ' 60's Faustian comedy was a box office failure in its day . ' Beyond The Fringe ' and ' Not Only But Also ' won Pete and Dud many fans , obviously not enough to make the film a hit . In America , the advertising overemphasised Raquel Welch's contribution , a big mistake seeing how she is in it for all of three minutes . ' Bedazzled ' opened when the popularity of British comedies was in decline , with only the ' Carry On ' series and all-star romps such as ' Monte Carlo Or Bust ' ( featuring Pete and Dud , incidentally ) keeping the genre afloat . Donen's glossy direction underlined the satirical intent of Cook's witty script , the way he keeps the episodic plot under control is masterly . Sadly , he never worked with Pete and Dud again . The name ' Stanley Moon ' came from Sir John Gielgud , incidentally , while ' George Spiggot ' was the Moore character in the celebrated ' One Leg Too Few ' sketch in ' Not Only But Also ' . Another recycled idea was the trampolining nuns . Dudley Moore wrote the wonderful soundtrack . Often overlooked when assessing this film is Eleanor Bron , playing multiple versions of her character . Not only is she beautiful but a marvellous comedy actress . Two years before she had appeared as a Kali Priestess in The Beatles movie ' Help ! ' . Funniest moment - too many to name , but I can't watch Wish No . 5 without weeping with laughter . Stanley and Margaret want to commit adultery , but can't because their admiration for her husband is too great ! One of the funniest motion pictures of all time . Watch it and treat yourself to a Frobisher & Gleason Raspberry Flavoured Ice Lolly at the same time ! ( The 2000 Liz Hurley / Brendan Fraser remake was good fun , but not a patch on the original ) .


Text2: Lon Chaney pays his dues I saw "" Poor Jake's Demise "" ( another allegedly ' lost ' film ) this week at the 2006 Giornate del Cinema Muto in Sacile , Italy . A print of this movie turned up in England in May 2006 ; its opening titles were gone , and someone had spliced on the opening title of a Charley Bowers one-reeler . ( Bowers was a comedian whose heyday - - such as it was - - came circa 1927 . ) At Cinema Muto , "" Poor Jake's Demise "" was screened with no opening title , but with its original intertitles . Several reference sources have cited "" Poor Jake's Demise "" as Lon Chaney's screen debut . Actually , it is the earliest known film for which Chaney received billing in trade publications : very likely , he had already performed perceptible roles in at least a dozen previous films , apart from movies in which he was one more extra in crowd scenes . When I first heard of this film , I assumed that it was related to the popular "" Poor Jake "" series of comic strips written and drawn by George Herriman circa this period , about an overworked farmhand . The name turns out to be coincidence . This movie is a crude slapstick comedy , produced by IMP - - Independent Motion Pictures - - one of the poverty-row concerns that eventually coalesced into Universal Studios . Chaney doesn't play the title role here : that dubious honour goes to Max Asher , a ' Dutch ' vaudeville comic with a Prussian moustache . Chaney plays a spiffy character who is apparently meant to be a lady-killer , but he endows this role with lots of the effeminate fussy movements which audiences of this period would have associated with the stock vaudeville character known as a ' nance ' . This movie is a clear rip-off of the Keystone formula , already established at this early date . We see a fairly normal-looking desk officer , but the three cops on the beat ( a big fat guy , a shrimp and a beanpole ) look like rejects from the Keystone Cops Academy . There are plenty of pratfalls here . I was surprised to see two separate gags involving the rude gesture of thumb to nose , which was considered extremely vulgar in 1913 America : at least as vulgar as the ' badfinger ' gesture today . Before entering films , Chaney had been a dancer and choreographer on the western theatre circuit , and he puts that training to good use here . His performance is extremely physical . He dives out a window , does a forward roll and comes up in a somersault . He executes a straight-back pratfall that would do credit to David Jason's "" Del Boy "" Trotter . When Chaney sashays his way up the porch stairs , he almost seems to break into a dance . At one point , he takes a siphon of soda-water in the face . Also seen to advantage here is Louise Fazenda , looking about the same as she would look at Keystone a bit later . Fazenda later married producer Hal Wallis and took a well-earned retirement . More for its historic value than for any actual merits , I'll rate "" Poor Jake's Demise "" . Good luck with that career , Lon !

The Brink starts in ' West Orange , NJ 1931 ' as inventor Thomas Edison's ( Monty Wall ) latest creation has unexpected consequences . . .

They set themselves up in an old abandoned & isolated farmhouse 50 miles from anywhere of note & get to work , they quickly discover that Megan's ex boyfriend Leo ( Jeff Ryan ) has joined the party as the ' voice of reason ' . Together they build the machine & turn it on at which point a ghostly figure ( Matt Miller ) appears holding an axe which it then uses to try & kill Todd , whoever said ghosts were friendly . . . Edited , photographed , co-written , produced & directed by Benjamin Cooper I certainly didn't love The Brink but I saw some potential here & thought it was watchable if nothing else . The script by Cooper & John Bowker takes itself extremely seriously & is a little slow to get going which it's main problem , films such as The Brink need to hit you hard straight away & keep you interested throughout , something which the makers of The Brink didn't do & it's over 40 minutes into the film before the four friends turn on the machine by which time it will have probably lost 75 % of it's audience who will have either turned it off & stuck Terminator 2 ( 1991 ) in the DVD player or switched it over to MTV . Hey , I'm all for a slow measured build up but this is ridiculous & quite frankly there's not that much to build up too ! The character's are OK actually & despite being of the teenage variety they didn't annoy me that much , the dialogue was alright & the basic story had potential especially a really neat twist towards the end which a lot more should have been made out of . Generally speaking The Brink isn't a particularly great film & I won't be in any hurry to see it again but there are one or two nice moments here & the story with it's twist had potential which unfortunately wasn't fully realised probably to the low budget & technical restrictions . Director Cooper does a decent job & I have to say The Brink actually looks like a proper film as opposed to a glorified home movie which is how I think a lot of recently made low budget shot on a camcorder type horror junk that litters video shop shelves look . I wouldn't say it's particularly scary but there are one or two atmospheric moments dotted throughout , there's a distinct lack of gore & violence as well . Someone gets her head sliced in half horizontally with an axe accompanied by a sound effect that resembles someone stepping in some mud & there's a chopped off hand but nothing else worth mentioning . I'm not sure what sort of budget The Brink had but I'll bet it was pretty low so bear that in mind , at least it's reasonably well made & watchable if nothing else . The Brink has a similar storyline to White Noise ( 2005 ) & even though it was apparently shot 2 years before White Noise came out The Brink was released straight-to-video / DVD after . The acting was OK but nothing special . The Brink was better than I had expected although to be honest that wasn't going to be hard , I can't really recommend it as my head tells me it's a terrible film but my heart says otherwise . I'll leave this one up to you & give it a middle of the road .

Text2: Very good mystery I hope that TCM broadcasts more of the "" Crime Doctor "" series , based on the radio show . Starring Warner Baxter , 1943's "" Crime Doctor "" is one of the first films Michael Gordon ( Pillow Talk ) directed , and it's a good , solid B movie . Baxter plays a criminal named Phil Morgan who gets amnesia after being left for dead on the side of a road . He rehabilitates himself and , still not knowing who he is , becomes a noted psychiatrist named Robert Ordway who works with prisoners as well as other patients . However , Phil Morgan stole and hid $200 , 000 and his fellow gang members want the money . As word gets around that Dr . Ordway is Phil Morgan , the question is - does he really not remember , or does he know who he is and where he put the money ? Baxter was 54 years old when this film was made . Fifty-four in 1943 isn't what it is today , so when the character announces that "" thirty years of his life "" have been wiped out , one wonders which thirty years he's talking about . The film covers a span of ten years , but it's just as hard to buy he's forty . It's a minor point - Baxter gives a sincere performance with an undertone of real gentleness . The supporting cast includes the lovely Margaret Lindsay , John Litel ( who play Nancy Drew's father in the series ) , Perry Mason's Ray Collins , and Leon Ames . I hope TCM shows more of the "" Crime Doctor "" series .

The plot has these people looking at vacation plots . . . you know timeshare stuff . While touring the facility , some members disappear and then the ants attack . They have to get away from them and go down a river on a boat to do so . This is my favorite part of the movie , going down the river . Lots of the cast are taken out here . Unfortunately , it ends rather weak as they all get to this town that has some sort of connection to the ants , but what ? I would have preferred this one to stay with the river and wood scenes rather than the town part of the plot , but overall this movie is good fun .

881,"Text1: Good , But Flawed . Ron Howard is , without doubt , an excellent director . One of the best , in fact . And this film does go a long way towards showing subsequent generations what happened aboard the Apollo 13 in 1970 . But while it does chronicle the events , it fails to show the political upheaval which took NASA by storm as a result of this failed mission and instead , chooses to focus on the heart-wrenching and sometimes played-to-death angst of the NASA wives . The arguments and disagreements which occur within that capsule are documented in the book written by Jim ( Hanks's character ) , and are downplayed something fierce in order to allow Ron Howard his warm and fuzzy feeling ; something he seems to need . While I haven't a problem with Ron's warm fuzzies , I do if they interfere with the story , and this time ( Sorry Ron ) , they do . Other than these oversights ( intentional or not ) , the film adequately depicts the actual events of the Apollo 13 mission . I know , because I was one of the millions who was alive , and remembers it . In spite of ignoring the ( understandable and excused ) virtual battle our three astronauts waged against one another in space , NASA fallout omissions , and errant warm fuzzies , I still enjoy this film .

Text2: "" To die , to be really dead , that must be glorious . "" One of the definitive films of the early horror genre , "" Dracula "" still maintains it's classic appeal . From his first words muttered on screen - "" I am Dracula . . . I bid you welcome "" - Bela Lugosi sets the brooding , menacing tone that pervades throughout the film , heightened by each sinister close up as he measures his victims . What better way to greet agent Renfield , than to describe the howling of a wolf outside of Castle Dracula - "" Listen to them . . . children of the night , what music they make "" . The Count makes Renfield his first victim , who now swears allegiance to his Master , surviving the ship voyage to England by devouring ants , flies and other small creatures for their blood . Dwight Frye's portrayal of Renfield is accompanied by a diabolical , guttural cackle that portends more misery to come . Upon arrival in London , Dracula makes himself at home at Carfax Abbey , adjoining the grounds of the Seward Sanitarium where Renfield is placed upon his discovery as the lone survivor of the Vesta's ocean voyage . From there , he casts his sinister eye on potential victims . In turn , the Count's presence is signaled by a flying bat or the howl of a wolf , creepily suggesting unspeakable horror . Contemporary fans of modern day horror films may find "" Dracula "" slow moving and even boring , but I find the pacing to be measured and deliberate . Even Lugosi's speech pattern , delivered with over enunciation due to his newness with the language , is perfect in defining the Dracula character . You come to believe it when The Count proclaims - "" There are far worse things awaiting man than death "" .

Text2: Texans in Paris For being an MGM musical , "" Rich , Young , and Pretty "" , has a strange look to it . Gone are the glossy backgrounds , those fabulous costumes , and great songs that were the trade mark of anything that came out of the studio . Yet , the film with its silly plot and predictable situations , is not a total failure . Thanks to Norman Taurog's direction , there are some good things to be found in the picture . It helps to explain Jane Powell , one of the most radiant musical stars of the era , was pregnant at the time this film went into production . It also explains why Ms . Powell , who had a beautiful figure , was dressed in the unflattering costumes like the one blue number she wears the first night she goes to La Parisienne with Andre Milan . To make matters worse , her blue dress is complimented with some sort of Dutch cap that makes this girl from Texas look she is Amish ! The film is made better because of the presence of Danielle Darrieux , one of the best actresses from France and who could have had a great career in Hollywood , if it weren't for the way she hated the way movies were made here . Ms . Darrieux plays Marie Devarone , the star of the exclusive night club . Danielle Darrieux's Marie shows an exquisite woman who knew a thing , or two , about how to charm an audience , be it in the night club , or otherwise . The supporting cast is not bad . Vic Damone made his debut in the movies here . Wendell Corey , Una Merkel , Marcel Dalio , and the rest do what they can with the material they were given to play . The film is harmless enough and the allure of Jane Powell and Danielle Darrieux in the same movie is enough for making us watch it .

I still recognize some of it from watching it more than a decade ago , and probably further back still . Putting images to classical music is a great way to get those of us ( yup , guilty as charged ) who just wouldn't sit down to listen to something like that under normal circumstances to experience it . Cartoons have aged remarkably well ( not just this , in general ) . . . what needs to , and / or is meant to , look imposing still does ( I won't blow what they are , for anyone who hasn't seen this . . . and those who have may very well know exactly what I'm referring to ) , and the whole thing still works , almost 70 years after it was originally released .

Drawing styles vary , and some segments are naturalistic , others almost psychedelic . Colors are vivid , and sometimes underplayed . Segments are briefly introduced by a speaker . There is story progression in at least some of the bits . I recommend this to anyone who doesn't object to two hours of animated visuals to go with some of the greatest score ever composed .

And you'll spend a restless twenty-five minutes or so before HEDY LAMARR makes her spectacular entrance and says , in a tone she obviously thought would nail her half-breed , dark-skinned character , "" I am Tondelayo . "" For the remainder of my review , I'll quote the article I wrote on HEDY LAMARR for FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE magazine : "" WHITE CARGO was the kind of film that seemed dated even then . The majority of reviewers found the entire melodrama old-fashioned and unconvincing . On the other hand , some viewers were , and still are , delighted by her campy performance as Tondelayo , who wreaks havoc at a British outpost in Africa . Even the sturdy cast of players headed by Walter Pidgeon , Richard Carlson and Reginald Owen , could not overcome the weak script and make the tale credible . Playing her entire role in an abbreviated sarong and dark body make-up , Hedy was still incredibly lovely . Of Tondelayo , she would later say , ' I thought with some interesting make-up , a sarong and some hip-swinging I would be a memorable nymphomaniac . ' Obviously , despite her intelligence , Hedy had a problem judging scripts . "" Just let me conclude by saying that all of the performances are embarrisingly inept , the script is hopelessly full of clich√©s , and the direction allows everyone to overact in such melodramatic silent screen fashion that it's a wonder anyone had a reputation left after this foolishness was over - - including director Richard Thorpe who had better films in his future . Unless Hedy in dark make-up and sarong is enough to hold your interest , WHITE CARGO is better left among the dustbins of film memories .

885,"Text1: "" What do you think of the Second Amendment now ? "" I think there are two ways that a movie with a title and cover box like Shoot Em Up has . It could try to be a hard boiled , gritty action movie and come off as something horribly clich√©d and trite , like a cheesy Van Damme or Seagal b-movie ( which have their own style of charm because of the actors involved ) , or it could overblow everything and come off as a fun action romp with little logic and even less need for it . Shoot Em Up goes for the second one , and it swings for the fences . It's like Baby's Day Out . With guns . Clive Owen stars as the Good Guy and Paul Giamatti stars as the Bad Guy , and there's really not a lot of characterization beyond that , despite the fact that a clear attempt is made at making him a three dimensional character as we occasionally see during exasperated calls from his nagging wife that , despite all his movie-villain tendencies , he's still just a normal guy . And of course , he gets some classic lines ( "" Violence is one of the most fun things to watch ! "" ) . Owen's character , interestingly named Smith ( what else do we need ? ) , is also pretty thin . All we ever learn about him is that he knows a hell of a lot about guns and can't stand it when people litter , don't use turn signals , or spank their kids . This is the perfect man for a movie like this . He's like a fountain of retribution when he needs to be , but because he hates all the right things ( and even has a soft spot for dogs , like all normal people ) , he can effectively deliver clever pearls of advice ( "" Eggs have no business dancing with stones . "" ) . The plot is tenuous to the point of meaninglessness . Smith is sitting on a bus stop bench casually eating a carrot by himself one night when a hysterical pregnant woman stumbles past , soon followed by a raving lunatic screaming that he's going to kill her . With an annoyed sigh , Smith gets up and marches after the man , as though once again having to reprimand a misbehaving child . Before long , he's holding a baby and cuts the umbilical cord by shooting it with his gun , and by now it's unmistakable what kind of movie this is . If you're not having fun by this point , you're probably not going to enjoy the movie . Everything in it is so overblown that it literally is hilarious , but Owen and Giamatti make the material work so well that it's one of the most watchable movies I've seen in quite a while . It also features what is possibly the most active role that a vegetable has ever played in an action film . Skydiving is one of the things that is almost never done right in the movies ( hear that , Wesley Snipes ? ) , but because it fits so well with the rest of the movie , the skydiving scene at the end of Shoot Em Up is outstanding , and doesn't look out of place at all . The movie is funny and exciting , and is brutally violent without being disturbing , because it's comic book violence . The movie will not be well received by much of the audience , for a myriad of reasons . It does , for example , have a pretty clear mistrust for politicians , especially ones involved in war . In today's political climate in America , I can see a lot of the supporters of Bush and the war in Iraq being unimpressed with a film that so cleverly criticizes such foreign policy ? "" Never trust the people who stand to profit , plain and simple . They're the bad guys . "" The rest of us , however , are going to love it ?


Text2: I'm just trying ' to be a better person . My name is Earl . . . I have a feeling that Mr . Brooks is going to be difficult for the more narrow-minded moviegoers to accept . Sadly , Kevin Costner is one of those actors who carries an iconography that makes it difficult for a great many people to accept him in certain roles , similar to people like John Travolta or even Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt . But the thing is , all of them are tremendously talented actors , and the constant bickering that I associate with their names stems from the guys I used to work in the video store with for a year or so after I finished high school . I never understood their immediate condemnation of the new Pitt of DiCaprio movies , which most often I watched myself and loved ( with the exception of The Beach , of course ) . I had immediate reservations about accepting Costner as a serial killer myself ( not the least reason for which is that I just watched Dances with Wolves again a couple weeks ago and haven't seen A Perfect World in maybe 15 years ) , but I watched the trailer and decided to give it a chance . Having done so , it's easy to understand the criticisms , but sad that these people were so focused on anything negative they could find , because it made them miss out on what is undeniably a taught , fascinating and brilliantly written and acted thriller . Yes , the relationship between Costner's Mr . Brooks and William Hurt's character , and the very existence of Hurt's character in the film , is some pretty thin cinematic ice , as is the concept of treating killing as an addiction , like alcohol or drugs . But the reason this works is because Costner and Hurt have genuine on screen chemistry and for many people , killing is done for a thrill . Mr . Brooks is just a guy who no longer wants that thrill , just like people who no longer want to drink , even though it makes them feel so good . Killing as an addiction is an extremely difficult concept to sell and the movie never really pulls it off completely , so instead it relies on high entertainment , outstanding performances and a simply brilliant script , and you know what ? That's just fine with me . Personally , I found it harder to believe that the one time Mr . Brooks made a mistake , he ended up getting photographed by an amateur photographer who just happens to share his lust for blood . RIGHT . ( spoilers ) There are definite weak moments in the film , it's far from perfect , but after re-thinking the entire movie , the only moment that really takes away from the film is not Demi Moore ( OR her character's divorce ) , it's not Brooks ' daughter committing murder herself ( she DID do it , or at least was certainly criminally involved ) , and it's not Hurt as the physical manifestation of Mr . Brooks ' rationalizing ego . The only thing that just doesn't fit is that bizarre techno shootout near the end , which looks like it would be more at home in a music video . It just came out of nowhere and went nowhere . And by the way , some have complained that we're supposed to "" feel sorry "" for Demi Moore's Detective Atwood for having to give up one or two million dollars when she is worth more than $60 million . Her conflict is not the money . This is made obvious by the fact that , as it is mentioned directly through dialogue , she doesn't do her job for the money . Her conflict is that her husband is a total dirtbag and she doesn't want to give him a dime . I would feel exactly the same . In many parts it's hard not to crack jokes , or at least think of cracking jokes ( "" Hello , my name is Earl and I'm a killaholic . . . "" ) , but to write this movie off because of it's weak , if numerous , shortcomings is a terrible mistake . It is inarguably one of the most original thrillers to come along in a good number of years and it's a tremendous accomplishment for everyone involved . Bravo !

Seattle college student Alan Newell ( Sidney Poitier ) is working at a crisis hotline center when he gets a call from housewife Inge Dyson ( Anne Bancroft ) , who is reaching the breaking point . Because they can't see each other , it gives the movie a real sense of tension , as implied by the title - even if it drags a little bit at times . A previous reviewer said that Poitier plays his usual role : a morally superior black man in a white-dominated society . That's partly true , but here , he has a job that anyone could have , and his race doesn't really matter ( although as the reviewer noted , they could have been subtly talking about race ) . As for Anne Bancroft , her death six months ago brings her filmography to mind . This may have not been her most famous role , but I would recommend it .

Schneer / Ray Harryhausen collaboration on various fantasy films which lasted till the early 1980s . It‚Äôs a typical sci-fi effort of the period : a usually harmless creature , rendered huge and deadly via radiation , is unleashed upon a large American city ( though , being an octopus , its fury is restricted to the bay area ) ‚Äì and the U . S . Navy teams up with a couple of renowned biologists to battle the monster . Fast-moving , fairly gripping and featuring solid characterizations ‚Äì even going so far as to include a mildly risqu√© m√©nage-a'-trois situation involving the protagonists ! ‚Äì the film generally delivers the goods as the unassuming but professionally-made entertainment it was meant to be . It stars Kenneth Tobey from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD ( 1951 ) as the Atomic Submarine Commander who first realizes that something‚Äôs wrong ‚Äòdown below‚Äô , and Faith Domergue from THIS ISLAND EARTH ( 1955 ) as the female member of the biological team . Basically , they‚Äôre duplicating their roles from the earlier films I mentioned ‚Äì except that Domergue emerges here to be sexy as well as brainy ( rather than staid as she was in THIS ISLAND EARTH ) , especially in a scene where she cajoles a frightened seaman into recounting his near-fatal brush with the giant squid . Considering that the creature‚Äôs appearance is usually relegated to the flash of one of its tentacles ( occasionally done in close-up for maximum impact ) , Harryhausen‚Äôs effects aren‚Äôt quite as spectacular ( or extensive ) as in his later colorful mythological adventures . That said , the monster‚Äôs seen pulling a ship down to the bottom , causes considerable mayhem at the Golden Gate bridge , and is even given one scary effect when its eye suddenly opens underwater just as Tobey and his ‚Äòrival‚Äô ( Domergue‚Äôs colleague / lover ) dive for a closer inspection .

Text2: THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT ( Herbert Ross , 1970 ) This is another film I had missed out on a number of times on Cable TV in the past . It's considered something of a censorship milestone with the treatment of taboo subjects such as prostitution , homosexuality and pornography ? not to mention the proliferation of bad language throughout ( unfortunately , the DVD is said to contain the slightly edited PG-rated version , which cuts some brief nudity involving female lead Barbra Streisand and her use of the f-word in one scene ) ! With this in mind , one has to consider the development which the comedy genre underwent during this time : from the mildly risqu√© sophisticated antics of the Doris Day / Rock Hudson films of the early 1960s to the cynical anxiety-ridden variety that started emanating towards the tail-end of the decade ? with which the likes of Jack Lemmon , George Segal ( the male lead of this film ) and , in particular , Woody Allen ( since he was his own writer and mostly directed himself as well ) are forever associated . THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is also notable for giving the current female singing sensation ? Barbra Streisand ? her first non-musical role ; in fact , it led to other wacky comedy vehicles : foremost among them WHAT'S UP , DOC ? ( 1972 ; Peter Bogdanovich's updating of the Howard Hawks classic BRINGING UP BABY [ 1938 ] ) and FOR PETE'S SAKE ( 1974 ; whose trailer , included on the Columbia R2 DVD of the film under review , makes it seem like a good deal of fun ) . Thanks largely to his role in the film , Segal went on to do his fair share of sex comedies up till the early 1980s ? with the most successful among them being A TOUCH OF CLASS ( 1973 ) , which I should be acquiring shortly . Anyway , to get to the main item : the film can be seen as a modern variation on the perennial "" Pygmalion "" theme ? with Segal as intellectual but , at the same time , neurotic and Streisand the uncouth yet liberated woman . There's no plot to speak of ? instead , we follow the two stars on a logical pattern of location-hopping around New York throughout which their relationship blossoms : from his apartment when she's evicted because of his snitching ( which leads to both of them being given the gate by the landlord ) , to them shacking up at the flat of Segal's pal ( who drives them out because of their constant bickering ) , then going their separate ways till they meet again ( after he has learned about her movie experience ? a hilarious scene ? and a ' colleague ' of hers has gone to see him at his workplace ) and go out together ( where they're harassed by a band of thrill-seekers ) , after which they find themselves at the house of Segal's fianc√©e ( a scene with an unexpectedly ironic punchline ) , to finally deciding to be completely honest with one another ( beginning with their real names ) . In this respect , the film emerges to be overly talky ( betraying its stage origins ) but there is a reasonable amount of invention and wit in the undeniable comedy highlights : Segal dressing up as Death to scare the hiccupping Streisand ; Segal using an aquarium as a TV set ? with him delivering an impromptu news flash ? to humor the insomniac Streisand ( her addiction to TV is illustrated by a surprising reference to the Lionel Atwill / Lon Chaney Jr . horror pic MAN MADE MONSTER [ 1941 ] ) ; the couple's argument over "" the sun spat morning "" line in the opening paragraph of a book by aspiring novelist Segal ; Streisand's account of the sordid activities her clients invariably came up with ( prompting Segal to describe her as "" a sexual Disneyland "" ) , etc . The film's soundtrack is highlighted by several songs from jazz / rock band Blood , Sweat & Tears .

The film itself is difficult but required viewing : as with all of Bertolucci's work during this period , it's politically-motivated ? with Jean-Louis Trintignant's ambiguous lead character virtually emerging as a symbol for our turbulent times ; it remains the director's best film and , along with Jean-Luc Godard's CONTEMPT ( 1963 ) , is also the most successful cinematic adaptation of an Alberto Moravia novel . Curiously enough , the address given for Professor Quadri's Parisian residence was actually the one where Godard himself lived at the time ? so the film can be read as a metaphor for Bertolucci's own disenchantment with Godard's current film-making policy , having abandoned mainstream cinema for a more didactic approach ! Bertolucci had also named Max Ophuls , Josef von Sternberg and Orson Welles as his idols and , indeed , the mise-en-scene of THE CONFORMIST is generally comparable to theirs in its operatic assurance : the detail and texture of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography and Ferdinando Scarfiotti's production design is at once exquisite and impeccable , while Franco Arcalli's inspired editing smoothly binds together episodes from the lead character's present life ( as a Fascist agent assigned to eliminate his former teacher ) and his equally secretive past ( where he had killed a homosexual seducer ) ? and it's all beautifully underscored by the haunting music of Georges Delerue ( who , incidentally , was also responsible for CONTEMPT ) . Most impressive among the cast were Trintignant , of course , but also Dominique Sanda ( in perhaps her most significant role ) and Gastone Moschin ( who adds a welcome dash of humor to the generally heavy-going proceedings as the hero's baffled yet dogged partner ) . The film's highlights are certainly the tango sequence between Sanda and Stefania Sandrelli ( which , obviously , anticipates Bertolucci's subsequent ? and most ? controversial film ) and the Quadri assassinations set against the beautiful but unforgiving snowy landscapes . This "" Extended Version "" restores a rather irrelevant sequence ( once thought lost ) of a party given by a group of blind Fascists in honor of Trintignant's marriage . As for the DVD supplements : while an Audio Commentary with Bertolucci himself would have been a desirable commodity , Laurent Bouzereau's 3-part featurette ( totaling some 38 minutes and comprised mainly of separate contributions from the writer / director and Vittorio Storaro ) more than makes up for this loss and is actually quite thorough ? analyzing all the various elements which have contributed towards making THE CONFORMIST one of the essential classics of World Cinema . For the record , I've still got a few Bertolucci films to catch up with ? I own LA COMMARE SECCA ( 1962 ) , LA LUNA ( 1979 ) and STEALING BEAUTY ( 1995 ) on DVD-R , DivX and VHS respectively ? but just as many that I need to revisit ? among them this film's predecessor / companion piece , THE SPIDER'S STRATAGEM ( 1970 ) ?


Text2: Another Franco "" goodie "" . Normally one would have the right to call this movie "" disappointing "" ( after all , it is about the arguably most famous serial killer of all time ) , BUT . . . it's directed by Jess Franco , so how could one expect a good movie anyway ? But even if you can ignore the puerile psychology , the unintentionally funny dubbing and the dim lighting ( all too often you'll find yourself staring at a black screen ) , it's more difficult to ignore that Klaus Kinski is not as lively as you might expect in the role of the Ripper . Someone in the film says that "" he can't control his compulsion to kill "" . It looks more as if he can't control his boredom . ( )

Both films are sad in a way but they are never boring and both have good special effects and the whole nine . Both film has some great music aswell ! Seeing Wilford Brimley in this film is a treat .

All in all a good movie , but at times you just wish there was more comedy . The Robin Hood time was the best as Monty Python alum John Cleese plays Hood . It is the funniest segment in the movie . Then the kid gets separated from his band of time travelers and ends up in sometime that isn't very funny at all . Sean Connery plays a king here , and I like Connery a lot so it is a shame he is in the weakest section of the movie . They also go to France during Napoleon's reign and they also have a brief stop on the Titanic as well , before the final world , which is some kind of dark realm . There are funny scenes in this world , but there are also times this world gets to serious as well . During all their travels a bad guy from the dark realm wants to get the time travelers to his world so he can steal their map , which shows all the time travel portals .

894,"Text1: one of my favorite westerns Nicholas Ray , one of those rare directors who could put in a style or outlook of his own in various films of different conventional types in 1950's Hollywood , has with his film Johnny Guitar a job very well done . I had the chance to see it on the big screen at a revival screening some months ago ( mostly among Joan Crawford fans ) on a double bill with Sam Fuller's Forty Guns . Crawford , McCambridge , and definitely Sterling Hayden ( one of my all-time favorite ' guy ' actors ) brought a lot to the entertainment factor of the film . The story goes like this ( and if you've seen Sergio Leone's Once Upom a Time in the West , you'll notice obvious similarities , as his was a slight homage of this film ) - Crawford owns a bar / parlor on the edge of town . The townspeople want her out to make way for a railroad , most vocally of this is McCambridge ( in maybe the best performance of the film , really the most theatrical ) . The title character is played with usual panache by Hayden , who at first is a little enigmatic , then reveals himself to have a past with Crawford . The story then unravels from there , in a way that actually went against my expectations , much to my delight . This is the kind of genre picture that knows what it is , but with a director clever enough to take chances . For example , there is the contrast of color between Crawford and the angry townspeople near the beginning of the film . She's playing the piano on one side of the room in a white dress , while the others , the supposedly ' good ' people of the town , are all in black . Is Ray messing with the convention of good guys white , bad guys black , or do we have to keep attentive all the way through to know how it plays out ? I think you'd have to - this is one of those westerns that has enough excitement , humor ( mostly dark or unintentional ) , and a climax that goes with some of the best of them . At the least it should hold up for those expecting something very dated - it's not quite as towering as the Leone films , but on its own terms Ray has a contender against all those old-school Ford / Wayne westerns .


Text2: a fairly short feature-length film , but within its parameters perfectly wonderful and adorable I wouldn't be sure that The Cat Returns would have an appeal to audiences as wide as Miyazaki's directed films would , since as a family film it is mostly amusing or curious for adults ( with the good laugh or two at the American voice work if one is inclined to listen to the new English dub ) . But for children it's just about one of the best in the anime field , a work that provides that great dose of fantasy and enjoyment while sticking to those tried and true themes with kids movies that only work so often ( such as here ) . While "" believe in yourself "" is in fact such a clich√© that it may eventually turn back around and become an original notion at some point in movies , in the Cat Returns it has that fresh perspective of a little girl , a genuinely caring and generous soul who's doesn't have many friends , who contemplates from time to time becoming a cat . In the Cat Returns , where young Haru saves a kitty from certain death while crossing a street and in the process is picked to become the wife to the Prince of the Cat Kingdom somewhere far , far away , there's even a slight Fantasy Island ala Pinocchio aspect to the piece ( which goes without saying the obvious comparison with becoming a cat by thinking or acting like one ) . It's all in good fun , but would one really want to be in a kingdom of cats presided by a Cat King who loafs about in total splendor ? Well , maybe , which is part of the conflict . But for kids this is just a core for the rest of the joy to spring out of . After the whole individuality-good aspect is covered , the rest of the picture has to entertain , and this is where Studio Ghibli works their usual best again . It's a gorgeously animated film , directed by Hiroyuki Morita from a somewhat original concept , delivering a wide variety of cats - small , cute , tall , proper , fat , fuzzy , shrill , sweet - and a great design of the Cat Kingdom itself with that shifty maze and giant towers . Morita almost disappoints with the running length : at 75 minutes , a few of those for credits , the Cat Returns could actually benefit from having more detail and bits of comedy and excitement . But it's then a backhanded compliment at the same time ; one has many memorable characters to pick from , like the big sidekick / bodyguard Muta , the King himself , Natoru the lackey for the king , and the Baron who is about as formal as a royal British officer . For children most of all it's the kind of treat they'll want to revisit many times , and a good point as well is the new English dub . It wouldn't be bad if the Japanese cut got some attention , which is the original and fine enough , but the voice-work from Anne Hathaway , Peter Boyle , Cary Elwes , Tim Curry , Eliot Gould , and Andy Richter is fantastic for sometimes so small or repetitive a performance ( as Hathaway points on the DVD , lots of screaming , varieties of yelling and yelps for Boyle ) that it's never less than delightful . The little kid in me , as well as cat lover , was very pleased . The only minor drawback is that some adults may feel a little left out of the simplicity of the piece on the whole as it isn't as all inclusive a masterpiece like Totoro .

895,"Text1: Two tumblers coming to the golden medina , and their older son Herschel Bernardi had a long career in movies and television - he even starred in a show called ARNIE that was briefly on television in the 1960s . But unfortunately he is rather forgotten today , although usually a very capable performer . I think part of the problem is a resemblance ( to me , anyway ) to Herb Edelman , also a good , but lesser performer - but one lucky enough to have a successful running role in the show THE GOLDEN GIRLS which is still in syndication . So people still recall Edelman because they can see him on cable networks . Unless they see films like IRMA LA DOUCE or LOVE WITH A PROPER STRANGER ( he was the corrupt police chief in the former and the older brother of Natalie Wood in the latter ) you won't catch Bernardi too frequently . Bernardi was ( like David Opatashu and Molly Picon , and Luther Adler ) one of the last actors that had any experience in the once very vital Yiddish Theater . He once did the narration on a pretty interesting documentary about the Yiddish theater and Yiddish films . So his casting here as Paul Muni's father ( Nahum Faivel Weissenfreund ) , a struggling actor with his wife Georgia Brown ( Salche Weissenfreund ) in Europe and America is quite good casting - he knows what he is dealing with . Yiddish Theater peaked in the period from 1900 to 1939 , when troops of actors speaking Yiddish could appear in plays in theaters in Eastern Europe and the United States ' main cities ( especially New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Cincinatti ) . But the Holacaust killed off the bulk of the audiences who spoke Yiddish , and those in the U . S . slowly assimilated so that - aside from words grafted into English like "" schlamiel "" or "" bupkis "" - most of the language became dead . It's a pity , but that is what kills languages , and their resulting cultures . There were sizable surviving fragments . Some major writers who used Yiddish are still widely read ( in translation , usually ) : Solomon Rabinowitz ( "" Sholem Aleichem "" of the "" Tevye the Dairyman stories that became FIDDLER ON THE ROOF ) , Isaac Besheves Singer ( Nobel Prize winner , who's YENTL became a Barbara Streisand movie ) , and Sholem Asch ( author of THE NAZARENE ) . But most of the writers , like dramatist and novelist Abraham Goldfadden , are totally forgotten today except by scholars . But Nahum and Salche are not facing this at the beginning of this musical . We see them as street performers in Eastern Europe , doing a number about a simpleton played by Salche ( a "" Kuni Lemill "" in Yiddish - one of these inspired idiots whom Nahum calls "" the riddle of the human race "" ) . Salche is expecting , and soon gives birth to their son Muni . And with a growing family Nahum is desperate to try to get a reputation in the Yiddish Theater , but he can't really get into it . So he decides to take his family to "" the provinces "" of the U . S . to get ahead . The show really chronicles the struggle of Nahum and Salche ( and eventually their sons Muni and Joseph ) in the American half of the Yiddish Theater . Nahum tries everything - even trying to show what a good actor he is by faking a heart attack in the middled of belting out a song at a try-out ( it doesn't work too well ) . We see them perform Yiddish vaudeville skits , with the boys , The growth of Muni is not shown as much as one would wish - but he does start noting how old men walk and move ( Paul Muni's film career has many old men parts in it : Zola , Pasteur , Juarez , Joseph Elsener in A SONG TO REMEMBER - this is how he was able to pick up his abilities to do these roles ) . The disintegration of the marriage between Salche and Nahum ( who plays around ) is noted too . The television play was very good , setting up a time and place that is gone forever . Bernardi and Brown were terrific in their parts . I do wish more could be done with Michael Kidd as the older Paul Muni ( who is reminiscing in his retirement about his roots - and does

Lucille Ball plays a dancer doing odd jobs who works as a decoy for the Yard when one of her friends mysteriously disappears and eventually shown to fallen victim to this maniacal killer .

Text2: Formula Thin Man stuff is still witty and sophisticated . . . Although I was never a big fan of the Thin Man films the way so many were , I have to admit that Loy and Powell carry the film with abundant charm , whether sober or drunk ( or just feeling high as they line up the drinks ) , but apparently its pat formula was so successful that it was repeated in film after film , so much so that it's hard to tell the other "" Thin Man "" titles apart . For a film that was shot in eleven days on a modest budget , it certainly did well at the box-office and ensured that there would be many more Nick and Nora adventures to follow . All the successful ingredients are here - - a cast of suspicious characters , each with a motive , and an assembly of first rate talent to support the shenanigans of Loy and Powell - - MAUREEN O'SULLIVAN ( as the daughter of the missing inventor ) , NAT PENDLETON ( as a detective ) , CESAR ROMERO ( as a playboy ) , EDWARD ELLIS , blonde MINNA GOMBELL ( years later , a nurse in "" The Snake Pit "" ) , and PORTER HALL . As usual , the comedic elements are stressed more than the mystery about the disappearance of a well-known inventor , but fans of the series probably preferred it that way due to the deft sophistication and debonair wit of one of the screen's most classic couples .

898,"Text1: Form and Function In Film Art MANITO is a fine little independent film that does what few of the big movies have tried : the manner of shooting an intimate family film set in the ghetto atmosphere with a hand held camera gives it the immediacy and grit of the story far better than the expensive multicamera shoots of other similar tales with big budgets . Writer / director Eric Eason succeeds in inviting us , the outsiders as audience , to witness the machinations of a family at war with itself as though we were in the hall , at the window , or behind the wall . The result is a powerful , unpretentious little film with clout . Manito ( Leo Minaya ) is the younger brother of Junior ( Frankie G ) who has succeeded in school and in social life in a way that eluded Junior . Junior is an ex-con ( we learn later how unjust that title is ) who is basically a ne'er-do-well womanizer , but still works hard to make a living for his wife and child . When Manito ( or Manny ) wins a scholarship on graduation , Junior is bound to celebrate his love for his little brother and his pride in Manny's achievements with a big party . The father of the boys is the poison that drives the potential celebration into a disaster in a manner that summarizes all that is evil in the environment in which the brothers have survived . The story ends in a tenor that leaves as many questions unanswered as it does in finalizing the tale . Franky G is the only known actor among this talented but inexperienced cast . And despite the many small roles he has had serving as eye candy ( and justly deserved ! ) for big movies , here he proves that he can indeed inhabit a role and give us a character who , despite his antisocial behavioral aspects , is a man we grow to love . The entire cast engages our attention as a verismo experience and witnessing the trials and smiles of this family sheds a warmer light on the Hispanic than most of the big movies afford . We doubtless - and hopefully - will be hearing and seeing more from Eric Eason . Grady Harp

However Asmodeus hasn't figured on demon killer Jake & his partner Sister Sarah Ryan ( Colleen Porch ) who are out to find him & stop him . . . Directed by Scott Ziehl there simply isn't any nice way by which I can describe Demon Hunter so I won't even try , it is complete total & utter crap & it's as simple & straight forward as that . I'm not sure quite who the script by Mitch Gould is aimed at or what sort of film this is supposed to be , large portions of this lame film is taken up with really bad philosophical dialogue between Jake & his new partner Sister Sarah . You see when it comes down to it Demon Hunter is basically a mismatched partner film , you know what I mean a sort of good cop bad cop scenario , in fact I kept thinking of Lethal Weapon ( 1987 ) as Jake is obviously the tough uncompromising one while Sister Sarah is the moralistic one & by the end of the film he's lightened up a bit & she has no problem shooting people . Far too much screen time is given to this really badly written relationship & the two cardboard cutout character's involved in it , listen guys this isn't rocket science here as all we , the viewer that is , want to see is lots of fights , some nudity , some good looking chicks in leather outfits & some decent horror . To add to Demon Hunter's problems it's incredibly slow , there is one fight during the opening sequence but then you have to wait until the film reaches the 40 minute mark before the next & then after that there isn't another fight until the end . There's no horror or exploitation worth mentioning & quite how the filmmakers managed to screw a half decent Blade ( 1998 ) type idea up this badly is beyond me . Director Ziehl does a reasonable job actually , it's got some nice photography & the odd stylish scene . Unfortunately the film is still awful , the action scenes are poor ( see Blade to see how it's done properly ) , there's no gore ( again see Blade to see how it's done ) , the special effects are poor ( see Blade to see how it's done properly ) , the main villain is terrible is neither scary nor menacing & doesn't do a thing except spout a load of nonsense ( see Blade to see how it's done properly ) although on a positive note his female sidekick looks quite foxy . In terms of gore there is one scene where someone gets a stake through their chest & there's one dead body & that's it . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 000 , 000 I suppose the poor effects & lacklustre action scenes can be blamed on a low budget but that still doesn't excuse the film for being so dull , boring & downright awful . The acting isn't up to much although it's nice to see Billy Drago in something even if having him in a The Matrix ( 1999 ) style kung-fu fight is stretching it a bit . Is it just me or is Porch a dead ringer for Angelina Jolie ? Demon Hunter is a low budget piece of action / horror Blade rip-off crap that lacks any action or horror , not a film to get excited about . One to avoid , just watch Blade again instead you'll be glad you did .


Text2: I Miss Walter Matthau Keeping up with the times this 1998 remake of The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three had to change certain things and deliberately changed others . One indisputable fact was that in 1998 the New York City Transit Police had ceased being a separate entity and was now just part of the NYPD . Hence Walter Matthau's character as a Transit Cop would not have existed any longer . For this version Edward James Olmos is not only a regular NYPD detective , but he's a hostage negotiator specialist . The change out the Transit Police was necessary , but part of what made the first version work so well was Walter Matthau being placed in a situation he wouldn't normally be dealing with . In that version in fact he's shepherding a bunch of Japanese railroad people around the Transit Authority Command Center when the hijacking occurs . Instead of Jerry Stiller as his partner , Olmos is paired with Lorraine Bracco , certainly women by that time were doing more than administrative work in the NYPD . The mysterious head of the four hijackers is Vincent Donofrio on the other side of the law . We don't know who he is , but he certainly didn't have the air of mystery that soldier of fortune Robert Shaw did in the Seventies . In fact we never really find out anything about Donofrio . The plot follows pretty much the story in the original version . Since it was shot in Toronto , the streets of New York where a lot of the excitement above ground as the City tries to meet the hijackers deadline is missing from this version . Seeing Donofrio and Olmos makes me wish for Matthau and Shaw . Maybe the new version that will have Denzel Washington and John Travolta as antagonists will be better .

Subtlety was passed over on every occasion for the the most manipulative of cinematic tricks , and the love story that anchors the film is boring and completely missing any sort of sexual spark . I have a feeling that this movie is so beloved because people who in reality have pretty low-brow movie tastes can watch it and feel like they're cinematically smarter . A double feature of this and "" Life Is Beautiful "" might just be enough to make me lose hope in serious film forever .

After this all their lives will change and they will each head into different directions with their lives . For the last time they do want they want and simply enjoy their youth and the innocence of it . The movie has multiple story lines as it follows multiple individual characters during that one night . Every character experience something different and also learn some important life lessons in the progress . It makes the story well written and developed and all of the characters likable and interesting , although they are very stereotypical . It also of course helps the movie that they are being played by some great actors . The movie features lots of actors that at the time were still very young but now are very ' big ' . Ron Howard , Richard Dreyfuss and Charles Martin Smith but also Harrison Ford in a small but very cool and likable role . A kind of role you wouldn't expect of him now days . Also look out for Kathleen Quinlan and Joe Spano in some small roles . So real great casting in this one ! Every actor delivers a very realistic and likable performance . The movie features lots of stereotypical nostalgic ' 60's elements , such as drive-ins , cruising the strip , drag races etc . The movie is good looking with some nice looking cars and production design . It really helps to set the right mood for the time period the movie is set in . Also of course the very present musical-score consisting entirely out of memorable rock ' n ' roll hits of the era helps to give you a real ' 60's ' feeling , even if you weren't even born at that time ( such as myself by the way ) . The movie is a great mix of nostalgic ' 60's elements and ' coming of age ' story lines . It makes "" American Graffiti "" an unique and pleasant viewing experience .

Doris Day's second feature may have been written expressly for the hot new talent , what with a feisty character similar to her own personality involved in familiar circumstances . Radio show producer Jack Carson loses his temperamental star and has to find a new and exciting singer , ' accidentally ' hearing perky Doris delivering a ditty and giving her a break . Playing a single mom and working girl , Day eventually goes to Hollywood yet doesn't forget her old chum , who has become a romantic partner . Extremely minor offering from Warner Bros . overdoses a bit on Day's natural spunk , though she does have a few nice numbers and works very comfortably with Carson .

Text2: Black Is Back . You've gotta hand it to Shane Black . This is the man who helped create the cop-buddy genre with "" Lethal Weapon , "" then turned around four years later and satirized it with his script for "" The Last Boy Scout . "" A lot of critics didn't like that movie because it was loud , ugly , profane , garish and Tony Scott-ish . But a lot of them simply didn't understand it . Ditto for "" Last Action Hero . "" It's one of the most daring and original Hollywood films ever produced , and yet somehow many of its stars didn't even appreciate it . Arnold signed on thinking it was just another action flick with some tongue-in-cheek humor ( as evidenced by his later comments about the film being "" too violent "" for kids ) . But that movie had a lot of brains , and it consistently made fun of the high level of cartoonish violence in any Arnie movie . And when "" The Long Kiss Goodnight "" rolled around , that is when Black proved once and for all that although his films may contain a surface of male machismo , misogyny , over-the-top violence and profanity , it's his clever writing that always undermines what's happening in the forefront . He's serving Hollywood exactly what they want , while still managing to take jabs at them underneath it all . He took the whole spy-thriller genre for a big twist , but once again a lot of people just didn't "" get it "" ? and it was another bomb . It shoved him into unwilling retirement . Now , Shane is black with his directorial debut , "" Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang , "" one of the best films I've ever seen . Entertaining from frame one , this gritty , smug little film carries over a lot of the unadulterated heavy violence and sexism inherent in so many action films from the 1980s and early 1990s . But it's all poking fun at itself , in typical Shane fashion . Take the scene where the heroine , Harmony Lane ( Michelle Monaghan ) , runs around a Los Angeles park in a skimpy Playboy outfit , for example . Shane even gives her a gun . Kiss kiss , bang bang . Robert Downey , Jr . plays Harry Lockhart , a small-time crook from the east coast who gets his partner killed in a toy store robbery and , on the run from cops , stumbles into an open casting audition . He breaks down in an emotional fit in front of the casting director , who thinks it's the best performance he's ever seen . He flies Harry out to LA to prepare for his role in the film , where he meets Gay Perry ( Val Kilmer ) , a gay Hollywood insider who is a private eye of sorts and is also gay . Did I mention he's gay ? Because it's made clear that he is . A lot . And in case you didn't get it the first time , they even gave him a Gay nickname . Literally . But that's the genius of this movie . Kilmer embodies Perry so well that he ends up transforming his character into a giant criticism of gay stereotypes . Perry is a stereotype who is aware of his stereotypes , and embraces them , and makes fun of them - and isn't afraid too , which makes it acceptable for us to laugh . Perry is even , to a point , another means to satirize Black's earlier material . Riggs and Murtaugh solidified the idea of buddies in a buddy-movie ? what they should be like , how they should interact , and so on and so forth . To suddenly have a buddy movie with a straight character and a gay character almost seems to be breaking the unwritten Buddy Movie laws that Black helped create . Perry is one of Kilmer's best and most likable performances , and he plays right into the hands of the wonderful Robert Downey Jr . , who is a true revelation . His comedic timing and fourth wall narrative are flawless . His interaction with Kilmer is classic , and one of the best buddy-pairings since "" Lethal Weapon . "" Go figure . It almost makes you crave for a sequel , even though you really don't want to risk them ruining the originality of the original .

903,"Text1: Mercury sinking ? Okay , before you condemn Mercury Rising for being what it admittedly is , a cheesy action movie , you should at least consider that it accomplishes what it sets out to do . This movie was obviously never meant to win any Academy Awards ( otherwise they wouldn't have cast Bruce Willis , at least at that stage in his career ) , but it does have some effective action sequences . The problem that I have with the movie is not that it fails as an action movie , but that it could have been so much better . The good action sequences are padded with at least as many awful ones , and there was plenty of thought put into about 5 % of the story , while the rest is on auto-pilot . There is a great opening action scene where Arthur Jeffries ( Bruce Willis ) plays an undercover FBI agent acting as a robber in an effort to end a bank robbery safely , before the trigger-happy cops outside suddenly decide to open massive fire , completely unprovoked by anything except the passage of time . What follows is one of those endlessly satisfying scenes where the angry hero stomps out to the official in charge who's stupid decision resulted in the deaths of all those bank robbers , criminal or not , as he defies all ranking by smacking him in the face with his pistol , although I can't help wishing that he had done something even more . Unfortunately , this is one of the most satisfying scenes in the movie , which goes gradually downhill from here until the end . Miko Hughes , one of American's beloved child actors who can actually act , adds to his already extensive filmography with his portrayal of Simon Lynch , an autistic boy who loves puzzles a little too much . Autism is presented in a fairly straightforward manner , although the potential for massive intellectual processing is hugely enhanced and milked for all it's worth here . The problem with the movie is that it takes an enormously unlikely scenario related to autism and makes and entire film out of it . Simon has cracked a government super-code that was placed deep within a puzzle in a ' geek's puzzle magazine ' to test it's durability , and when he manages to decipher and call the secret phone number , all hell breaks loose . And by ' all hell , ' of course , I mean the rest of the goofy plot of the movie . The film starts off presenting an intelligent story about national security , until we realize that this is a code that they spent billions of dollars on without bothering to explain where those dollars went . This may be something that I just don't know , but what is it about a code that costs billions of dollars to make ? Is it the two guys in the little computer room who charge too much for their services ? Are the rates for Federal Hitmen getting out of control ? This is where the movie really slips , by the way . Instead of simply admitting that there is obviously a problem with the code , which can be solved by a 9-year-old boy , autistic or not , and then setting about changing the code , the FBI agents involved literally turn into murderers , sending out a hit man , black gloves and all , to murder the boy and his parents , erasing him from existence and then hoping no one ever asks any questions . The action in Mercury Rising succeeds , for the most part ( except for some awful blue-screen scenes , like the one between the trains ) , but it has enormous problems on a foundational level . Some stuff succeeds ( I rather enjoyed the scene in the wine cellar , but even this is founded on a movie with an unstable premise . I think that Roger Ebert pointed this out best at the end of his review when he says that if a billion dollar code can be cracked by an autistic boy , don't kill the boy , kill the programmers .

It turns out that Evelyn is not exactly married to Clinton Foley she's only living with him as a mistress in his mansion . The story get's even more complicated when later both Arthur and Evelyn , who it turns out is actually Arthur's estranged wife , disappear from sight leaving Foley to suspect that they planned this all along from the start .

907,"Text1: The Louisiana Puchase Exposition of 1904 This is a nearly flawless musical film by Vincent Minelli based on a series of writings by Sally Benson about her real life family from St . Louis , Missouri at the turn of the 20th Century . Although the most famous sequence ( and a real heart-breaker at one point ) deals with the current Christmas season , the film really looks at the events in the Smith family from Spring 1903 to Spring 1904 , culminating in their attending the above mentioned Louisiana Puchase Exposition that was under construction at the time . It was one of many Worlds Fairs that were frequently occurring in the 19th Century , the most notable previous ones in the U . S . being the 1876 Philadelphia Worlds Fair ( the movie CENTENNIAL SUMMER is about that one ) , the 1893 Chicago World's Fair ( subject of a few movies ) , and the 1901 Pan American Exposition at Buffalo , New York ( which is involved in the plot of the film THIS IS MY AFFAIR , because President William McKinley was assassinated there ) . The Louisiana Purchase Exposition was best remembered for the invention ( by accident ) of the hot dog and the ice cream cone , the latter when a vendor ran out of paper mittens for holding the frankfurters and sausages and bought some roles , the latter when a vendor ran out of paper plates for ice cream and used some soft waffles as cones . But in it's day it was an exciting place and it was a very successful world's fair . The Smith family is made up of the father ( Leon Ames ) , the mother ( Mary Astor ) , the grandfather ( Harry Davenport ) , the son ( Henry Daniel Jr . ) , and the four daughters ( Lucille Bremer , Judy Garland , Joan Caroll , and Margaret O'Brien ) , and their cook ( Marjorie Main ) . Bremer has a boyfriend studying at Princeton ( Robert Sully ) and Garland is fascinated by the next door neighbor ( Tom Drake ) . In the course of the year we watch the family enjoying their close friendships with other St . Louis residence ( even little Tootie - Margaret O'Brien - likes to ride and help the iceman Mr . Neeley ( Chill Wills ) ) . We see them having social parties with singing ( Minelli includes many songs in the film , but he does maintain period music - one hears Ethelbert Nevin's "" Narcissa White "" and the popular tune "" Under the Bamboo Tree "" that is sung and danced by Garland and O'Brien ) . Even some of the songs for the film are set in that period , most notably "" The Trolley Song "" . The trouble in the story is the decision by Ames to move to New York and begin a New York City office of his large St . Louis law firm . This shakes up the family , who are used to living in St . Louis , and think of New York ( in the warning words of Marjorie Main ) as a place where people live in tenements ! While this film has great , sweet comic moments ( O'Brien in Halloween disguise playing pranks on neighbors with flour and fake bodies ) , it also has one truly gut wrenching moment . If any film belongs to two players ( despite ensemble excellence ) it is MEET ME IN ST . LOUIS . Garland's songs ( THE TROLLEY SONG , THE BOY NEXT DOOR , HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE Christmas ) all are wonderful and became part of her legendary repertoire . But O'Brien stole the heart of the audience as "" Tootie "" , not just by her funny antics ( she looks so cute and little in this film ) but in her dramatic scene - when she breaks down at the thought of leaving St . Louis and destroys her snowmen family so nobody else can have them when they move . The sequence always brings tears to my eyes as it is perfectly done . This comment does not ignore the other players . Ames turns in a gilt edge performance as a father who learns a valuable lesson in what is important to his family above larger salaries . Astor is properly loyal to her mate , even if she disagrees with his initial decision . Davenport spices the film ( particularly at the Christmas dance scene , where he rescues Garland ) , and Main has her normal salty comments about the activities around her .

Though antsy at times , he seemed to be fairly well mesmerized by the events on screen , and not distracted by a nearly full theater packed with kids on a Sunday afternoon . Film animation continues to make wondrous strides , and it looks like Disney and Pixar have another hit on their hands . The film will appeal to the inner kid in all of us that yearns for a simpler time and good friends to share it with .

Text2: WHO CAN KILL A CHILD ? ( Narciso Ibanez Serrador , 1976 ) I only became aware of this film when it was first released on DVD ( not the R1 edition , which is how I eventually watched it ) ; I got even more interested after being impressed with director Serrador's only other feature film ? the stylish Gothic horror THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED ( 1969 ) . Actually , though I've had the disc for some time , I finally opted to watch it as a special birthday treat ! Anyway , the film emerged to be fully deserving of its considerable reputation ? though not without its flaws ( more on them later ) . While it's usually ranked as horror ( in view of the violence , I presume ) , I find it works just as well as science-fiction ? in that the phenomenon that makes the entire kid population of the island community homicidal remains unexplained ( not to mention the way the children are made to connect telepathically with each other or , for that matter , the heroine's demise at the ' hands ' of her unborn infant ! ) . In this respect , it's also similar to Hitchcock's THE BIRDS ( 1963 ) ? acknowledged as such by the cinematographer in one of two interesting accompanying interviews on the Dark Sky DVD ( the other is with the director himself ) . We've had several films featuring ' demonic ' children before and since , but few elicit as much power and sheer creepiness out of the casual savagery of their acts ( that said , we were usually treated to an isolated case ? even in THE EXORCIST [ 1973 ] ) ; incidentally , the film's ironic ending is virtually identical to the contemporaneous THE OMEN ( 1976 ) ? followed by a coda which suggests an INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS ( 1956 ) - type outbreak is in the offing ! The d . p . also comments on how he approached the genre in exactly the opposite manner that would have been expected of him ? rather than fill the film with darkness and menacing shadows , much of the action takes place in broad daylight ( indeed a torrid climate ) ? though he concedes that the isolated community was something of a clich√© ( and , in particular likened its besieged protagonists to those in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD [ 1968 ] ) . Having mentioned films that may have influenced this one , there's the obvious link to VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED ( 1960 ; in fact , one of the film's alternate monikers is ISLAND OF THE DAMNED ! ) while the scene in which a little girl comes crying for her father , only to lure him to his death , smacks of "" The Wurdalak "" episode from Mario Bava's compendium BLACK SABBATH ( 1963 ) . By the way , the fact that the two leads are English , it's preferable to watch the film in this language ? since the locals speak Spanish anyway ( which is accompanied for our benefit by English subtitles ) ; consequently , the fact that the heroes are strangers in a strange land ? surely one of the key narrative elements ? becomes that much more effective . Even so , I was somewhat underwhelmed by the performances of Lewis Fiander and Prunella Ransome ? of course , their complete ordinariness worked for the plot but it was a bit of a strain to invest nearly two hours in their plight ? especially since much of the surrounding events are tackled in a similarly low-key nature and , what's more , at a deliberate pace ! Some viewers may be shocked by the fact that a ) children appear to indulge in senseless violence throughout , an experience they're shown to treat as a game and b ) the retaliation by the adults , when it arrives , is no less harshly depicted ( particularly when one kid is shot in the head with a gun ) ; however , the director treats both these aspects with great sensitivity ( despite potentially offensive scenes such as the one where the children disrobe a teenage German tourist they've just killed and who had previously tried desperately to contact the protagonists ) and aplomb ( for instance , the subtle image of a body lying under the counter in a grocer shop and unseen by Fiander ) ? the film , ultimately , is more arty than exploitative .

Text2: Dead and buried in Hollywood "" To Live and Die in L . A . "" tells of a T-Man who will stop at nothing to settle a score with a counterfeiter ( Dafoe ) who murdered his partner . A moody and very Hollywoodish action / drama , this film does little to distinguish itself , save one very good car chase , and plays out like just another cop vs bad guy movie . Petersen is too generic and vanilla and acts like a hyperactive Secret Service agent on meth . Funny money freak Dafoe is too stereotypical and acts like he's trying to be the personification of evil on ludes . The story is flawed with plot holes aplenty and obvious histrionics and the principal protag Petersen is too bad to be good , leaving the audience with no one to root for . Nonetheless , this flick received excellent reviews from critics with Ebert giving it a top four stars . Personally I couldn't remember anything about the film after 20 years , though I have vivid recollections of Friedkin's earlier "" French Connection "" . "" Live & Die . . . "" is fodder for TV action junkies but too old to be state-of-the-art and not good enough to be a classic . Watchable but passable . (

912,"Text1: A Nutshell Review : Mirrors Looking at the filmography of Alexandre Aja , he's becoming dangerously close to being branded as a director who specializes in remakes of films that can allow him to amplify the original gore factor , and one who hopefully doesn't position himself , intentionally or otherwise , such that audiences would come to expect a twist in every single one of his movies . While I'd enjoy his Haute Tension and his version and update of The Hills Have Eyes , he seemed to have reined himself in with Mirrors , where allowance for violent excesses was minimized and allocated to creating mood and tension , which succeeded as the movie went along , and plodded forward during many moments in the beginning when Kiefer Sutherland's Ben Carson began probing the mystery of his workplace . You can just about sense Aja's glee when it came to scenes that called for gore , and at times succumbed to cheap scares which were rather successful . However , Aja can't decide if this was going to be an all out spiritual spook fest , or a monster movie , and that confusion resulted in an actual schizophrenia , where one ending is insufficient , and you'd need two endings in order to provide for some bang for the buck . It's as if it ran on multiple fronts which could be delinked from one another , and if not for the characters ' relationships , it could well be a series of shorts pasted together with the mirrors being running motifs where spirits reside in , and can determine life or death , with a concept quite refreshing , but again , unoriginal since it's a Hollywood adaptation . While Aja might seem to want to tread back to familiar territory at every opportunity at gore , Keifer Sutherland too can't seem to break too far away from his cop related roles for the big screen , save for lending his voice in Phone Booth , his recent The Sentinel and this one still had his character come from the force . Perhaps it's lazy casting on the filmmakers ' part in getting someone already familiar with the territory so that audiences can immediate latch onto his Jack Bauer persona , and have it plain sailing from there . And no matter how Sutherland tries to provide a new dimension to his mentally pained ex-cop , he just can't shake Bauer off , which became as niggling as the persistent spirits that call out for his attention . And that familiarity didn't just stop with the director and the lead actor , as it extended toward the supporting appearance by Amy Smart , though in a not so surprising role of being here just to shed her clothes . I thought she could be a decent actress without having to resort to such "" tricks "" , but I guess filmmakers from Crank to Mirrors still haven't got enough of her Road Trip stint . Again , very dangerous ground to tread on for the mentioned - one for gory remakes , one for cop roles , and one a naked flowervase . Granted there were some fine moments courtesy of special effects , with misbehaving mirror images and the way characters get dispatched - slow , painful and plenty of blood - but those looking for occasionally fine scary moments may find them in Mirrors . I've not seen the original 2003 Korean movie Into the Mirror which this movie is based upon , but given the cheeky finale , I just might be interested to check out the Korean version . For now , I'd start to think about those palm prints left behind in mirrors as they will never look the same again .


Text2: A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Il Mare ( 2000 ) One of the earlier Korean hits in Singapore was Il Mare , starring Jun Ji-hyun and Lee Jung-jae , and last year it became the excuse of a remake by Hollywood to reunite Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock on the big screen . If anything good comes out these remakes , it is the acknowledgement that Asian stories are finding some legs to travel . There was no hesitation to obtain my copy of this movie when I saw the DVD , given that almost all the versions of the movie here was the VCD oneJust so you know where I'm coming from , I haven't seen the original , and had seen the Hollywood remake first . But if you were to ask me to decide right now which version is superior , I would say without hesitation , the original Korean one triumphs over the remake , simply because , as a romance , it sure knew how to present it the way it's supposed to be . The way the movies were made , is akin to the lake house featured in both movies - the Hollywood one is very grand , with plenty of bells and whistles , but the Korean one is simpler though by no means less effective , in its minimalist look and feel , puts the focus of the story squarely on our lovebirds separated by time . The first thing that strikes you is how quiet this movie can be . There is less dialogue , and it allows the images do the talking . As the clich√© goes , a picture is worth a thousand words . Containing plenty of beautiful , idyllic soft focus shots which contribute to the overall romanticized feel , Il Mare is slowly and intricately paced , and less complicated with its relationships , and its supporting cast is few and not given anything substantial to steal thunder and limelight . This , compared to the very Hollywood style of development every minor subplot into a major one , and having to explain everything to the audience - this I thought was sledge-hammered through in the remake very early on into the film , which after watching how it was dealt in the original , you'll agree at which version is more superior . There were many instances of "" homage "" shots , like the red coat , the paw prints , and the shots of the mailbox , as well as adapting plot elements like the train incident , and liberties were taken to bring to life some of its supporting casts , which were only mentioned in passing in Il Mare . If not for the inflation of run time because of the lack of skill in making a beautiful picture , then I don't know what is . Il Mare allows the audience room to piece together clues and events , without stifling , and this enables a greater appreciation , as well as time to be absorbed totally into the lives of our protagonists , 2 lonely hearts finding each other through a temporal time warp via a mailbox at Il Mare , the name of the Lake House . One's an architect , and the other's a voice artistes , and both connect heart to heart during the winter season , leaving the question of , if we can click , why not meet up and get together ? Jun Ji-hyun and Lee Jung-jae play off each other really well , even though they share limited screen-time together . Coupled with the way each had their individual scenes shot , framed , and presented , I'd say again , you can't help but to feel for these 2 , and root for them to transcend hell and high waters to come together . Watch this movie to find out if they do ! ! Certainly one of the better romantic tales out there , done totally right . Forget about The Lake House , make it Il Mare instead !

913,"Text1: "" Am I not the spawn of his depraved blood ? "" Impressive 60's Edgar Allan Poe adaptation from Roger Corman . Pit and the Pendulum ( there is no ' The ' at the beginning of the on screen title ) starts in 1546 somewhere in Spain . Francis Barnard ( John Kerr ) has travelled from England to investigate his sister Elizabeth's ( Barbara Steele ) sudden death . Francis arrives at a large foreboding mist enshrouded castle that sits on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean & belongs to Elizabeth's husband , Nicholas Medina ( Vincent Price ) . Francis knocks the door and Maximillian ( Patrick Westwood ) the butler answers . Nicholas's sister Catherine Medina ( Luana Anders ) also turns up and invites Francis in . Nicholas tells Francis that Elizabeth died unexpectedly three months ago from a condition of the blood . Francis is unimpressed by Nicholas's explanations and feels he is not being told the truth . The only other person in the castle at this point is the maid , Maria ( Lynette Bernay ) . At dinner that night Dr . Charles Leon ( Antony Carbone ) turns up . His side of events differ from Nicolas's . Leon claims that Elizabeth died from sheer fright as she became obsessed with a torture chamber situated in the bowls of the castle that belonged to Sebastian Medina ( Vincent Price , again ) , Nicolas's Father who was one of the most cruel and feared members of the Spanish Inquisition . Catherine's body has been resting in the Medina's families tomb for months but the distraught Nicholas fears that Catherine may have been buried alive , like his Mother . Strange occurrences start to happen , whispering voices & unexplained incidents that suggest Nicholas may be right and somehow Catherine has returned for revenge ! As the night draws on the sinister goings-on are revealed as a thunder storm rages outside , but can anyone survive the ultimate terror of the Pit and the Pendulum ! ? Produced and directed by Roger Corman I was pretty impressed with this adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe novel of the same name . Pit and the Pendulum was the second of Corman's Poe adaptations coming after the House of Usher ( 1960 ) & before Premature Burial ( 1962 ) . The script by Richard Matheson effectively mixes haunted house horror & psychological terror with a satisfying twist ending . An ending that may not come quite as much of a surprise these days but is still very good all the same . I also loved the final ' poetic justice ' shot . There aren't many characters in the film but the ones there count . The acting is good all round but I did think Price went over the top a little at certain points , although one could argue that this was deliberate and was intended to be relevant to the twist ending . Having said that I wouldn't want any other actor but Price in the role . Forget about blood or gore as there isn't any , but don't let this put you off as a horror film doesn't have to be gory or violent to be good . One thing about Pit and the Pendulum that really stands out is the overall production design , sets , costumes and lighting . The film has a wonderful Gothic look throughout . The castle's cobweb strewn torture chamber , or it's gloomy flickering candle lit rooms and corridors with it's stonework walls . The solid antique looking furniture and props . The whole film is lavish and really looks the part , the evocative sets create half of the wonderful atmosphere on their own . Quite amazing considering that the budget was apparently only $200 , 000 which probably wasn't a lot even back in 1961 . Generally speaking the film is also well made throughout and at just under 80 minutes it never drags and is consistently both interesting & entertaining . On the negative side I'm not too sure I would watch it again now I know the twist ending and when all said and done not a great deal actually happens . But it's still a great character and plot driven Gothic horror / thriller from the early 60's that stands up very well even today & should be seen by all fans of the genre , so what are you waiting for ? Watch it !

914,"Text1: Errol Flynn's attempt at film noir I think it is generally acknowledged that Errol Flynn's best film work was in those films that combined his charm and his athletic abilities , be they swashbucklers , boxing films , or westerns . But as he got older Flynn was determined to prove his acting abilities . He could act when he was generally interested in the film he appeared in , but he was frequently willing to try to do a film that was unusual . This did not always work too well . He made such interesting failures as THE SISTERS with Bette Davis , where he was a newspaper reporter in turn of the century San Francisco , who had a wanderjahr that interfered with his marriage . The film wasn't bad , but his part was weak - the antithesis of the type he usually played so well . In the late 1940s to 1950 he tried three films to broaden his scope of acting : CRY WOLF , THAT FORSYTE WOMAN , and SILVER RIVER . Only the last one , a western where he played a man who was carried away by ambitious and greed so that he becomes relatively unsympathetic , was successful . THAT FORSYTE WOMAN ( with Greer Garson and Walter Pigeon ) was interesting ( Flynn as Soames Forsythe was interesting casting , but he was too stiff - Eric Porter's memorable Soames in the first BBC version of the Galsworthy stories in the 1960s was far more human ) . CRY WOLF , the present film , was Flynn's only real attempt at the noir style of movie . As such it begins well , but collapses due to a poor script . Barbara Stanwyck has married Richard Basehart , the nephew of Flynn , before the movie began . Flynn , Basehart , Jerome Cowan , and Geraldine Brooks are the scions of a "" Kennedy "" style family , with money and political power ( Cowan is a U . S . Senator ) . But Basehart has vanished , and Stanwyck , besides trying to prove her marriage , is determined to find her husband . And here she keeps running into Flynn's suspicious behavior . He seems very unsympathetic to her wishes , and quite cold most of the time . As for helping her locate Basehart , he keeps on throwing up roadblocks . The problem is that having set a good stage for a film which would have been confronting Stanwyck's heroine with Flynn's villain , the script fell apart . It turns out Flynn is interested in protecting the family's name and it's members from outside scrutiny . In particular Basehart and Brooks , who are somewhat strange . This change in the script was meant to enable Stanwick and Flynn to gradually fall in love and end up together , but it smashed the suspense that such a film should generate , and it ruined Flynn from having a potentially interesting negative part . Actually his performance in SILVER RIVER was far more consistent , and even his Soames retains the audience's lack of sympathy to the end . In CRY WOLF the audience gets confused - should we hiss Flynn or cheer him on ? It would have been better all around if the screenplay writers had let us hiss him to the end .

Having a great low-paced dark story written by James Russo and very well developed characters , this movie is completely underrated in IMDb . The whole cast has an excellent performance , highlighting James Russo , maybe in his best role , and the good actress Theresa Russell . The pessimist and non-commercial storyline is very real , having no plot point or surprises , becoming darker and darker and without redemption , being a gem to be discovered by adults .

916,"Text1: The Threat of Sidney Stratton ? THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT , like I'M ALL RIGHT JACK , takes a dim view of both labor and capital . Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one ( he has never gotten his university degree due to an . . . err . . . accident in a college laboratory ) . He manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry . When the film begins he is in Michael Gough's company , and Gough ( in a memorable moment ) is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law ( Cecil Parker ) by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs . While having lunch with Parker and Parker's daughter ( Joan Greenwood ) , Gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab's unexpectedly large budget problems . He reads the huge expenditures ( due to Guinness's experiments ) , and chokes on his coffee . Guinness goes on to work at Parker's firm , and repeats the same tricks he did with Gough - but Parker discovers it too . Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on , and convinces Parker to continue the experiments ( but now legally ) . The result : Guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it's molecular structure so that ( for all intents and purposes ) the fiber will remain in tact for good . Any textile made from it will never fade , get dirty , or wear out - it will last forever . Guinness has support from a female shop steward , but not her chief . He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich . But when he explains to them what he's done , they turn against him . If everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes ! Soon Parkers ' fellow textile tycoons ( led by Gough , Ernest Theisinger - in a wonderful performance , and Howard Marion-Crawford ) are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses . They seek to suppress the invention . With only Greenwood in his corner ( although Parker sort of sympathizes with him ) , Guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public . In the end , Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed . But he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations , and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all . It's a brilliant comedy . But is the argument for suppression valid ? At one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown ( you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united . There is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat ( or contract if the owner gets thin ) . Are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever ? What happened to fashion changes and new styles ? And the cloth is only made in the color white ( making Guinness look like a white knight ) . We are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process . Wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile ? Alas this is not a science paper , but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry . As such it is brilliant . But those questions I mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing Guinness ' invention


Text2: What a web sight ! At a time when every other animation studio seemed to be imitating Disney , the Fleischer brothers ( producer Max , animator Dave ) were consistently turning out clever animation that was technologically innovative and often brilliantly funny . The Fleischer toons typically began and ended with live-action footage , and often used considerable live-action during the story proper . . . as in the well-known ' Ko-Ko's Earth Control ' and in the more obscure ' Trapped ' . One of the ways the Fleischers showed the originality of their cartoon technique was in their method of introducing their character Ko-Ko the Clown . Although Ko-Ko appeared in dozens of silent-era cartoons for the Fleischer studio , it was a point of pride for Dave Fleischer always to introduce Ko-Ko by means of a different visual device in each cartoon . In ' Trapped ' , we see the cartoonist's hands as still photograph cut-outs , manipulated in front of the camera to look like live-action movie footage . The hands sketch a small black dot and ink it in . Then the dot proceeds to bounce across the cartoonist's easel , until the hands finally catch it and unfold it into Ko-Ko the Clown . Now the toon gets going , with Ko-Ko encountering a giant spider . . . who has a human face that's decidedly male , even though the spider spins a gigantic web . ( In the real world , only female spiders spin webs . ) What makes ' Trapped ' distinctive is that the action cross-cuts between Ko-Ko's battle with the spider and our live-action cartoonist ( Dave Fleischer himself ) in his travails with a live-action mouse in the Fleischer studio . Eventually , the cartoonist sets a mousetrap . Of course , Ko-Ko escapes from his cartoon and gets caught in the live-action mousetrap . Then Ko-Ko develops some web-spinning techniques of his own , and he proceeds to spin a gigantic ( cartoon ) spiderweb all round the head of the dozing live-action cartoonist . ' Trapped ' is not as funny as ' Ko-Ko's Earth Control ' ( few cartoons are ! ) , but it's visually innovative , and you and your kids will enjoy it . The black-and-white footage of a real mouse is not likely to disturb anybody . I'll rate this delightful toon .

LIONS FOR LAMBS as a movie has the courage to do just what the message of the film attempts to do : encourage the American public to stop being so apathetic about our position in the global community . The dramatization of three points of view about the Middle East conflicts ( it not only takes on the Iraq debacle , but adds the Afghanistan and Iran problems as well ) could , in lesser hands than Robert Redford's direction of Matthew Michael Carnahan's script , be a preachy bore . But while the ' action ' of the film may not grab the viewer , the afterburn of the message will haunt the thinking person . Three scenarios interweave ( at times a bit bumpy in the editing , and at times a bit distracting ) : adamantly pro-war Republican Senator Irving ( Tom Cruise ) is interviewed by long time thinking journalist Janine Roth ( Meryl Streep ) and each defends / attacks the current strategy of the war in Iraq ( Irving is taking calls about the latest ' expansion ' into Afghanistan ) ; Professor Malley ( Robert Redford ) tries to resurrect a sense of involvement in a student Todd Hayes ( Andrew Garfield ) once bright but now sinking into the apathy of living the good life ; ex-students of Professor Malley - Arian Finch ( Derek Luke ) and Ernesto Rodriguez ( Michael Pe√±a ) - have committed to the idea of acting for change and have ended up being dropped in Afghanistan in the very ' new ' war Senator Irving is addressing . By stirring these three approaches to the manner in which the public is a currently addressing the war in Iraq in a concurrent conversation , the film involves the viewer in the crossfire of apathy and misinformation that come from failed education , faulty governmental intervention and the media sellout to get ratings . It is not a pretty picture , but then our current state of affairs is not one of which we can be proud . There are no answers here , just harsh realities and questions as to why we can remain so passive as a nation involved in the lowest state of global respect ever known . The film has flaws , but if the viewer can digest the information illustrated by some very fine acting , perhaps there may be a chance for a wake-up call .

Text2: "" Are you a friendly carrot ? "" The first series of ' Rutland Weekend Television ' inherited the time-slot ( Monday , B . B . C . - 2 , 9 P . M . ) of the brilliant fifth season of ' The Goodies ' , and was just as funny in its own way . ' Monty Python ' had ended the year before , and its members were keen to try out different comedy styles . John Cleese made ' Fawlty Towers ' , Michael Palin and Terry Jones gave us ' Ripping Yarns ' , but Eric Idle chose to keep the spirit of ' Python ' alive by writing and starring in this sketch show . ' R . W . T . ' was the name of Britain's smallest television station , run by incompetent , talentless people , and the budgets were so low its output rarely rose above the fifth-rate . Programme ideas were cribbed from existing shows on other channels , such as ' Rutland Five-O ' , and if they did a musical of the ' On The Town ' variety , chances were it would be set not in New York New York , but Tunbridge Wells . In one sketch , Eric interviewed ' The Wittiest Man In The World ' who turned out to be anything but . ' The Old Gay Whistle Test ' had Eric as ' Whispering ' Bob Harris , introducing a rock band whose lead singer has died , yet still performed . My favourite items were the spoof documentaries - in one a farmer breeds beauty Queens , in another a British soldier continues to fight World War Two from The Isle Of Wight , a house is taken over by policemen , and squatters have to be sent along to evict them . Very Pythonesque . Ex-'Beatle ' and ' Python ' fan George Harrison made a memorable appearance in the Christmas Show ; after playing the opening chords to ' My Sweet Lord , he changes tack and belts out a spirited song about a pirate . Movies were spoofed too . ' Pommy ' told the story of a young man who goes deaf , dumb and blind after watching a Ken Russell film . Any similarity between it and Russell's own ' Tommy ' was , of course , intentional . Idle was given fine support by David Battley , Henry Woolf , Gwen Taylor , Terence Bayler , Bunny May , Carinthia West and of course , Neil Innes . The former ' Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band ' member had appeared in the final season of ' Monty Python ' , and for ' Rutland ' he provided some superbly witty song pastiches . He later landed a show of his own , the criminally underrated ' The Innes Book Of Records ' . One sketch in the second series was ' A Hard Days ' Rut ' , starring ' The Rutles ' . When shown in the U . S . A . during an appearance by Idle on ' Saturday Night Live ' , it caused such a sensation that a full-length television movie was later made - ' All You Need Is Cash ' ( ' The Rutles ' ) . Flicking through the Sky channel network recently , I came across a few stations that reminded me strongly of ' R . W . T . ' . Eric's show was ahead of its time alright . The only thing he got wrong was that his presenters were mainly middle-aged , whereas today's are young and annoyingly trendy . If by some chance , you're reading this Eric , any chance of a D . V .

Text2: A Cinema Pioneer Remembered Neglected for a century , the aged woman's cinema treasures , like THE LOST GARDEN in a fairy tale , await rediscovery by a new generation . This poignant & thoughtful documentary introduces the viewer to Alice Guy-Blach√© ( 1873-1968 ) , finally being acknowledged as the world's first - and for many years , only - female film director . Through the narration of her granddaughter , Adrienne Blach√©-Channing , the viewer is introduced to a charming old lady with a remarkable past . Present at the very birth of the cinema in Europe , Guy-Blach√© , through a series of fortunate circumstances , went on to direct hundreds of two-reelers in France & America from 1896 to 1920 . Long before talkies arrived in 1927 , she was pioneering the synchronization of motion pictures & sound . Today , tragically , she is virtually forgotten . Artistic flair is used in seemingly integrating interviewees directly into the ancient films .

920,"Text1: Victor Salva's supremely creepy and effective debut horror feature A trio of dangerous psychopaths escape from a nearby asylum and murder three circus clowns . The deranged fruitcakes dress up in the clowns ' garish costumes and make-up . They proceed to besiege a large mansion where three brothers - - jittery Casey ( the solid Nathan Forrest Winters ) , friendly Geoffrey ( winningly played by Brian McHugh ) and mean overbearing bully Randy ( a marvelously hateful turn by a then unknown Sam Rockwell ) - - live . Tautly directed by Victor Salva ( who later gave us the excellent road thriller pip "" The Nature of the Beast "" and the deliciously perverse "" Jeepers Creepers "" pictures ) , with surprisingly strong performances by the three capable youthful leads , plenty of creepy atmosphere , a pleasingly concise 81 minute running time , and a respectable corpse count of eight , "" Clownhouse "" makes the grade as a gripping and well-made edge-of-your-seat nail-biter . The clever subversion of the naturally unsettling aura about clowns ( what's actually behind the cheery smiling facade ? ) is an especially smart and inspired touch . Moreover , Salva wisely downplays graphic gore and excessive violence in favor of deftly creating and sustaining a supremely eerie and unnerving tone . It's the film's potently spooky and nightmarish mood which really clinches its sterling status as an extremely scary and harrowing horror sleeper .


Text2: The first submarine photoplay ever filmed ! When I read during the opening credits of the 1916 adaptation of Jules Verne's "" 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea , "" immediately I assumed the frame of mind that I always do when watching early films , so as not to criticize it's lack of special effects or advanced film techniques . Immediately I was immensely impressed at the transfer from book to film , as the film followed the story closely and faithfully . Unfortunately , this only lasted for about the first ten minutes of the film , which ultimately proved to take Verne's work and butcher it in every way imaginable . Probably the most jarring change to the story is that they decided to not only adapt 20 , 00 Leagues , but also another Verne novel , Mysterious Island , into this film . So the result is that you have two totally different stories taking place that don't at all seem to fit together , until finally they come together in the bizarre conclusion , which makes absolutely no sense in respect to the novel . My current theory is that because so much of the original novel of 20 , 000 Leagues was decades beyond the reach of the filmmakers to be able to put on screen , so they probably had to look to an entirely separate novel just to have enough material to fill a full length film . Sadly , it reminds me of those terrible songs that radio stations sometimes come up with when they combine two popular songs together that have a similar beat , resulting in something that is not quite equal to but definitely less than the originals . One such bizarre hybrid comes to mind involving Closer , by Nine Inch Nails , and Garbage's # 1 Crush . The basic , basic , basic plot structure remains , but literally 95 % of the story is gone . There is rumor of a massive sea monster and the crew of the Abraham Lincoln set off to capture it . Strangely enough , at one point it passes a mere few meters from their ship in broad daylight , and the crew can clearly see the steel plated sides and the rivets holding it together , even the bridge and periscope , and yet they still think it's a sea monster . I'll attribute that to the inability to emulate the Nautilus's movements as described in the novel , but in this way we also have to sacrifice the entirety of the ship's glorious design and function , which is not even described in dialogue . For the most part , we see a single room , which looks like an old Victorian bedroom with one wall that looks like it belongs in a boiler room . Probably the worst crime that the film commits is in the character of Captain Nemo . Granted , Nemo in the novel is not exactly the most charming and charismatic man , but it is as if they set out in this film to create a man as far from the original description as humanly possible . As a result , we get a bizarre spectacle that looks like a disgruntled Santa Clause in blackface . And not only that , throughout the film he gives several displays of compassion that the original Nemo would have scoffed at . Indeed , at one point , he torpedoes a ship , and then afterwards and then almost faints as he worries about the safety of the victims . What the hell ? ? And incidentally , Verne's Nautilus didn't have torpedoes , although he did use it as a ramming weapon . In the film's defense , the underwater photography is truly impressive given the time that it was filmed , and surely knocked 1916 audiences , most of whom had probably never seen the underwater world , out of their seats . This would certainly explain the seemingly endless lingering on these scenes . Their is also an interesting allusion to another Verne novel , as at one point in their underwater tour they come across a decayed shipwreck , which Nemo describes as "" the wreck of an old blockade runner . "" And the worst thing about the bizarre personification of Nemo in this film is the backstory that was invented for the film which , amazingly , is introduced with this intertitle - "" Captain Nemo reveals the tragic secret of his life , which Jules Verne never told .

Text2: Goofy's Freeway Troubles is another entertaining and educational Goofy cartoon Just watched this Walt Disney educational cartoon starring Goofy on YouTube . This is the sequel to Freewayphobia # 1 and is the last time original Goofy voice Pinto Colvig would play this iconic character before his death in 1967 . This time , the Goofy character plays Stupidus Altimus-someone who's careless about everything especially driving and the many other things involving either packing , checking , or repairing his car . Quite a few hilarious visual gags like when the tire detaches from the running car on the freeway or when stripped to his boxers while stopping on the road , another running car takes away the polka dots on them ! And narrator Paul Frees can be both humorous and serious in making his points of how important a checklist is when preparing to take the automobile for a ride . So on that note , for Disney enthusiasts especially those of Goofy , I highly recommend Goofy's Freeway Troubles .

922,"Text1: One of Us . This has to be the only totally straight movie that David Lynch ever put his fingers on . And at that , it's not entirely straight , but it seldom edges into Lynch's private vision , or through the looking glass , or down the rabbit hole , or into The Garden of Earthly Delights or the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir , or wherever it is that his other films , beginning with "" Eraserhead "" , have voyaged . It's a sentimental and ultimately tragic story naturally . John Merrick , the elephant man of the title , was a rude lump of foul deformity , a simulacrum of a human being . What else could they do , turn it into a comedy ? A werewolf movie ? John Hurt is Merrick , kept in thrall by Bytes ( Freddie Jones ) who exhibits him to the public in a freak show in Victorian London . Merrick is rescued by Dr . Frederick Treves ( Anthony Hopkins ) who sneaks him into a hospital run by Carr Gomm ( John Gielgud ) where he is tended by nurses who are frightened of him . All the nurses except their chief , Mothershead . Mothershead is enacted by Wendy Hiller who was never frightened of anything on this planet . Gradually the staff come to realize that despite his disfigurement , Merrick is really a sweet and gentle soul , forgiving and grateful for the smallest of kindnesses . Warmth replaces fear . And when Treves takes Merrick home to meet his wife ( Hannah Gordon ) , this caprice of nature begins to sob quietly , saying , "" I've never been treated so well by a lovely woman . "" It's sentimental all right , but the script has prepared us for the scene and it avoids being banal . Imagine how much worse it could have been . Instead of being barely able to speak , or rather hiss , his lines - - instead of producing mediocre sketches - - instead of merely building a model cathedral out of match sticks - - the script could have turned him into a genius ! Wouldn't that be fun ? Elephant Man rescued from freak show writes a smash hit Broadway play ? Paints the Mona Lisa of 1890 ? Mentally extends pi to 23 digits in ten seconds ? Invents Leggos ? No . The only thing Merrick has going for him is his utter joy at being treated humanely . Thank God he's just a nice guy , not a saint . There are a couple of weak elements in the film . One is the bloviating score . It tells us precisely what we are supposed to feel , and the precise moment we're supposed to feel it . There is a macabre dance while the helpless Merrick is waltzed around the room by a horde of drunks . And Freddy Jones as the villainous and sadistic Bytes is - - well , he's SUPPOSED to be evil but his pop-eyed performance not only chews up the furniture but swallows it . The rest of the principles are frankly splendid . Models of acting , really , with not a sour note being struck . Especially interesting is Hannah Gordon's portrayal of Treve's wife . She's not a dazzling beauty but has one of the most expressive faces on screen . She tells us everything we need to know by just lifting an eyebrow . ( What Freddy Jones could have learned from her ! ) Hannah Gordon doesn't have that much screen time here but catch her , if you can , in "" Miss Morrison's Ghosts , "" in which she plays opposite Wendy Hiller , to see a true professional at her best . The director , David Lynch , keeps his act together in this relatively straightforward story but it wouldn't have been made quite this oddly by anyone else . I mean , the film opens with a scene of Merrick's mother being run down and trampled by a herd of screaming , stampeding elephants . What the hell does that have to do with the movie ? It's never mentioned in the script . It's certainly not Merrick's fantasy . And there's no reason to believe that his mother really WAS frightened by elephants . Although Lynch doesn't use many tricky codes in the movie , he rarely passes up a chance to show us the grimy perineum of Victorian London - - the basement fires being stoked , the black smoke billowing from the chimney , the intricate reticula of a lace curtain stirring in the open window , the slick wet bricks

923,"Text1: First episode of a single experiment on Alfred Hitchcock Presents In the years that ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS was part of television the format was stories that were told in half an hour episodes . Later the episodes were expanded to full hour episodes . But only once did the show try to do this format : a three part retelling of the story , which was based on a play by Alec Coppel ( who did the novel for MR . DENNING DRIVES NORTH and worked on the screenplay for VERTIGO ) . Coppel's play had ( by 1957 ) been twice telecast in Great Britain , once in the late 1930s and once in 1947 . But given the 30 minute episodes ( actually more like 24 minutes due to commercial interruptions ) there were three half-hour episodes that were made for the series . It was never repeated , possibly because it required a degree of exposition of the previous episodes before the next one could be shown . Count Victor Mattoni ( Anthony Dawson ) is found shot in the head by a maid ( Patricia Hitchcock - Hitch's daughter ) in his London flat . The case is being handled by Inspector Davidson ( John Williams ) assisted by Detective Raines , a new man at the Yard ( Charles Davis ) . In the course of the investigation Davidson constantly finds Raines an ironic counterpoint due to what he has to what they both discover , and Raines honest ( perhaps too honest ) reaction to the evidence or statements . For soon they are deluged by statements . It seems that Mattoni was a bad gentleman , and he may have had more enemies than a man should . For instance , Viscount Storrington ( Alan Napier ) hated Mattoni for his treatment of his daughter , whom the Count has married . There is a child by the marriage . The Count wants custody of the child , and has threatened to take his bitter wife to court for a fight for the custody , unless she agrees to return to him . Then there is Bernard Froy , a wealthy American sportsman , who is in love with Countess Mattoni , and has written him a threatening note ( which Mattoni is using for some blackmail ) and now wants to get the letter back . Then there is Mullett ( Melville Cooper ) who works in the hotel , and whom Inspector Davidson claims that he seems to recall having seen before . Cooper cannot place Froy in the hotel , but he can place Storrington there . The secret of the play is that several of the characters confess to the murder of the ogre Count . Davidson and Raines have to sort it out , in the wake of a fourth confession . In the end of Part III they have an answer , but they realize it is not an easy answer for the law to reach justice here as in a normal case . The performances were all good , especially Williams again as a Scotland Yard Inspector . A young Rosemary Harris as another person who is in the ill-fated residential hotel rounds out the cast of this amusing play-let .


Text2: "" This is my song . . . I can sing it tall and I can sing it long "" I remember seeing this the first time when I was attending public school in Queens in the early 1960s . It was shown as a treat to the students at an extended G . O . assembly . I had not seen it when it came out in 1958 ( I was only four ) but I recall seeing Disney's PETER PAN about that time , so I cannot understand missing this film . It was a fun film . The trick animation ( which won an Oscar ) was particularly good in the sequence when the toys came to life . It was probably influential with similar scenes in BABES IN TOYLAND in 1960 . However , BABES IN TOYLAND had the benefit of the Disney studio , not to mention a wonderful Victor Herbert score . The score of tom thumb was not very memorable , except for the song that I quoted above , which had some of the silliest lyrics I can recall . The film was actually more interesting than I would have known as a child . Besides George Pal's style in the film and the trick animation , it was one of the last musical films that had a major role for Jessie Matthews as tom's mother . In the U . S . Ms Matthews is not too well recalled , but she was the leading female musical comedy star in England in the 1930s . Her husband here is Sir Bernard Miles , who is better remembered as the villain in Hitchcock's remake of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH . The star was Russ Tamblyn , finally in a starring role - a step beyond his performances in THE LAST HUNT and SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS , and heading for his best performance in WEST SIDE STORY . The second lead , Alan Young , had already made ANDROCLES AND THE LION and AARON SLICK FROM PUNKIN CREEK , and ( as he was here working with George Pal ) would have his dramatically best role ( or roles ) in Pal's future masterwork THE TIME MACHINE . Young would also soon gain television immortality as "" Wilbur Post "" the friend of the talking horse MR . ED . This film was one of the pairings of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers in a comedy . As Tony and Ivan they are the greedy thieves who use tom to rob the town treasury , only to turn on each other in a fight that enables tom to trip them up . Terry-Thomas has a sharpened nose in his makeup , which is accentuated by his sharp crowned hat . Sellers in particular had interesting make-up in this film , fattened up to look particularly threatening in a greasy sort of way , and wearing a small derby hat . He has the best line in the film . When tom ( still unaware of what crooks he is with ) is inside the town treasury Tony / Terry-Thomas tells him to pass over a bag of gold . Which one , asks tom . "" THE BIGGEST ONE !

The graphics were blocky but the locations were quite atmospheric and it was a great button basher . Later on I played it on the Mega Drive , which had a few extra levels added . But somehow it just wasn't as cool . The extra Mega Drive levels included action in the Batmobile and Batwing in which you would blast the Joker's clown cars off the streets of Gotham or destroy the balloons full of poison gas .

Text2: Not impressed ! Somewhere inside the overlong , 114-minute Bullitt there is a brisk 90-minute long film desperate to get out . But as it is , it's seriously overlong with nothing to sustain it . Many pointless scenes come and go with loads of long , indulgent tracking shots goose-up the running time . I almost nodded-off a few times , I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about regarding this film . The paper-thin story has Detective Bullitt trying to determine how a Mob informant in Police custody managed to be killed ( he's not actually killed until about an hour later though ) . A local politician ( Robery Vaughn , who didn't really want to do the film ) acts as the token bureaucrat , standing in the way of getting things done . But getting WHAT done exactly ? In 114 minutes almost NOTHING happens in this damn movie ! Instead of mystery , clues , police procedure , shoot-outs and problem-solving we're treated to scene after scene of . . . not much . Bullitt eats food at the hospital , he goes shopping for celery and TV dinners , he hangs around with his girlfriend ( a completely pointless character played by Jaqueline Bissett ) and sometimes takes a passing interest in the case . About 80-minutes into this bore he is FINALLY involved in a car chase ( THE car chase that everyone raves about ) that ' tears up ' the streets of San Francisco . I don't understand why this film has so much adoration or why all the fans proclaim it's ' the original and best ' , ' the one that started it all ' or any other generic soundbite you can think of . There were cop movies before this , there were car chases before this . What exactly is Bullitt credited with ' starting ' ? A sense of being cool , calm and collected doesn't turn water into wine . Bullitt is plain , repetitive , agonizingly slow and almost completely without a plot . Don't consider me a philistine or someone who has been brainwashed by the over-edited nature of modern films where we're guaranteed and explosion every five minutes . I appreciate films from all eras and from all backgrounds . But Bullitt is just way , way overrated certainly does not deserve the high regard it's been lauded with . A real disappointment .

I got there by by traveling on a ferry from Rothesay to Wemyss Bay and then catching a bus from Wemyss bay to Greenock . Unfortunately one day I returned from Greenock to Wemyss Bay there was a gusty wind which meant the ferry to Rothesay was cancelled and I had no money for a hotel . Fortunately myself and several other hapless travellers were allowed to stay in the Cal Mac ( the Ferry operators ) office for the night , there were cups , a kettle , T-bags and a television so we , the captive audience , sat back to watch DOWN WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM Since the drama was mostly set in Greenock ship yards I recognised the locations at once . Strange as it may seem I had no idea who the lead actor was . I'd never seen MEAN STREETS or TAXI DRIVER at this point in my life while RESERVIOR DOGS , PULP FICTION and THE PIANO were still to be made so the name Harvey Keitel meant nothing to me . My comrades for the night laughed out loud but I wasn't too impressed , it's a very low concept drama featuring Keitel's tough shore patrol policeman married to a Scottish girl with lots of domestic angst .

Text2: Excellent family entertainment - - and thank goodness it doesn't stray too far from the source material . Okay , many of you are about to become offended , but I've gotta say it . The movie version of "" How the Grinch Stole Christmas "" ( THE GRINCH ) was a horrible movie in practically every way . The worst problem with it is that the entire moral lesson of the original story is lost and in fact the movie states the exact opposite of what the author intended ! ! In the book and Chuck Jones special , the Whos were nice folks that didn't need all the presents as they were sincere in their reverence for the holidays . In the Jim Carey remake , the Whos were all selfish and materialistic ! ! What a horrible way to ruin Dr . Seuss ' vision ! It's like translating the Bible and making Satan the good guy ! In light of how far THE GRINCH strayed , I especially loved HORTON HEARS A WHO because it didn't wander far from the source material or convolute the moral of the story . Sure , the story was changed a bit and several subplots were added , but I could accept this - - after all , they had about 88 minutes to fill and there had to be SOME padding . However , the original story can still easily be distinguished and perhaps after this film , Seuss can finally stop spinning in his grave ! ! So , apart from the faithfulness to the original story , what did I like ? Well , I was once again thrilled to see Fox making CGI films . Their ICE AGE films were pretty good and HORTON is even prettier and more entertaining . Quality-wise , this is about on-par with a Pixar or Dreamworks production . I particularly loved Whoville - - as with powerful computers , they were able to animate hundreds , if not thousands , of wonderful Whos . And it was cute all the little tiny touches - - so much so that the film holds up well to repeated viewing in order to catch all the action and details . Plus the town looked very Seuss-ian - - like the pages of the books come to life . It was a real joy to watch . Was there anything I didn't like ? Well , the song at the end by REO Speedwagon was simply terrible way to wrap up the film . It was schmaltzy and pointless and looked as if the producers were stuck finding a decent way to tie everything together . However , considering this is my only gripe , then this is still a heck of a film - - one the kids AND parents can enjoy . Kids will love it and parents will actually not be bored - - a rare achievement in a film .

If this isn't enough , the judge , played admirably by Jaclyn Smith , finds the father , a widower , who couldn't cope following the tragic death of his wife when Sally was 3 . The judge makes believe that she wants him services for landscaping before she tells him the truth . Even with this obvious liberal bias , this film was extremely well done . The performances are first rate , notably Jaclyn Smith and Lyn Fonseca as the troubled child she takes in . I guess that the judge saw the Spencer Tracy-Mickey Rooney 1938 classic-Boys Town . Remember , there is no such thing as a bad boy . Everyone has redeeming qualities .


Text2: There Will Be Blood - The Blood Sure Clots in the Last 20 Minutes I have never seen a film to deteriorate in the last 20 minutes in the way that "" There Will Be Blood "" does . The film has a great plot - a man who becomes very wealthy from oil drilling , and the apparent abandoning of his son who is deafened by the blast of oil being discovered . I thought that this would be the basic story line , the relationship between father and son through the years . Instead , we see the horrible relationship between Lewis and the town pastor . This film is certainly an anti-religious one . At the end , we see the human frailties possessed by the pastor . The two had a fight by film's end in a manner that reminded me of Max Bialystock and Leo Blum fighting in 1967's "" The Producers . "" The ending is simply awful . Before the last 20 minutes , Lewis gives a restrained but powerful performance as the wealthy oil driller who is really insane . A the time of the horrible ending , Lewis announces to his valet that he is finished . He should have been so 20 minutes sooner .

The first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . She is beaten savagely , spun around in the chair endlessly , has her finger nails pulled , animal guts are thrown at her , hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle ( really sick and nasty scene ) . The makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape . Of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome . I have seen also "" Flowers of Flesh and Blood "" which is more gory and sadistic , but less disturbing . Anyway , this one is a must-see for horror fans !


Text2: A Nutshell Review : Boy I guess this subject had already been explored a number of times recently - how convicted criminals , upon release from their jail term , attempt to re-integrate themselves back into society . With Little Children and The Woodsman , we essentially have pedophiles who were released and had to deal with deep rooted prejudice and non-forgiveness in the community they reside in . But what if this criminal is a killer ? Based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell , "" Boy A "" refers to the unnamed boy who cannot be positively identified during the trial as he's a minor . After serving significant time behind bars , we see him being released from prison , and working with his counsellor Terry ( Peter Mullan ) , he adopts a new identity as Jack Burridge ( Andrew Garfield ) . This is not only for an opportunity to start life afresh with a totally new and made up background , but to serve as a mask of protection against retributive attacks by the case sympathizers , or by the family members who may be out for their own brand of justice served . But of course this is no action movie , so scrap those thoughts of having a man on the run , with contract killers on the loose . What we have here instead is a touching exploration of a teenager's despair at trying to recalibrate his life after the chilling crime committed at an age where he was influenced by best pal Philip Craig ( Taylor Doherty ) . And here's where Andrew Garfield's ability got tested to the max , where he constantly has to live a lie , and finds it extremely hard to work at , and obtain the trust of others , always having to deal with the niggling feeling that he's not being totally honest , and with romance in the picture with Michelle ( Katie Lyons ) , it just complicates things . Fate allows him to redeem himself , but one wonders if that is enough , and whether one good deed can free oneself from the sins of the past . Garfield's charismatic presence will engage you from the get go as he carries the movie through from start right up until the end , and kudos too to the editing and direction set to weave what's essentially two story arcs seamlessly together , with the current timeline , and one which looked at the mysterious past where events were presented a little bit at a time . We see how the two young boys evolve over time in their spiral downwards in morality , and even so the dastardly crime doesn't get shown verbatim , but only through a fishing reference , which will cause the audience to question how culpable Jack was with his involvement in the crime . Running parallel to Jack's story is that of Terry the counsellor was well , being estranged from his wife , and having to address the disappointment he has with his own son . It's not hard to see how close he is to Jack , and how under his care or lackof , would develop inside each boy as the story went along . And this character study also extended to various supporting characters as well , especially one whose promise to another seem to ring hollow the minute you hear it , which just makes it a little bit more heart-wrenching when you see Jack's nonchalant response , as if pre-emptive , and in the know . So , yellow ribbon project ? I suppose the reality of it is that it still boiled down to the crime itself , and just how tolerant society is toward it in a case by case basis . Don't let this gripping drama slip you by , it's powerful stuff that will continue to pose questions for discussion way after the end credits roll .

Text2: "" Weird "" is right This is a very strange film . On one hand it's perfectly entertaining , but it's so bizarre and - to be blunt - utterly far-fetched and beyond-ridiculous that it actually kind of distracts from the entertainment value at times . The plot is so dumb - and the way it's handled - that suspension of disbelief is pretty hard . However , if you look at it as a realization of every teenage boy's fantasy , I guess it's all right . It's essentially about two 15-year-old boys ( Ilan Michael-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall ) who "" create "" a woman using electricity , a computer and a Barbie doll . This was my problem with the movie . John Hughes is usually great at character development and dialogue - but there's so little here . The setup is weak and the boys ' decision to create a woman is handled waaaay too fast . And then the science behind their actions is ignored so much that it's almost insulting . The "" hacking "" of the computer mainframe that takes place during the Barbie doll's transformation into a human is classic ' 80s technology - they had no idea what a computer even was back then and as a result the "" hacking "" segment is basically an animated slideshow of cool images on the computer screen as Smith types noisily away on his keyboard . Their result ? The beautiful supermodel Kelly LeBrock , who promptly takes a shower with the boys ( their clothes are left on , of course , but hers are not ) and then teaches them how to be cool , get girlfriends and so on . I was surprised by the amount of sexual content for a 1980s movie involving under-age teens . I've seen people say here on IMDb before that ' 80s movies couldn't get away with anything but that's not true . It may have been the Reagan era but this movie features 15-year-olds making out with a woman in her late ' 20s , sexual innuendo involving the woman ( it's implied one of the two boys has some type of sexual contact with her during the first night ) , underage drinking , underage smoking , and then of course a classic scene that could never be filmed today - Anthony Michael Hall mimicking African-Americans in a seedy downtown bar . I don't mean to sound like a prude , I was just shocked at how much they got away with for a 1980s , PG-13 John Hughes comedy . The acting in the movie is decent . Anthony Michael Hall is a revelation , and his scenes as a drunk pimp in downtown Shermer are hilarious . He comes across as a true comical force , which I was surprised at considering he's not usually the leading man in films . On the other hand , Smith is poor - he smiles throughout the movie , even when he's supposed to be scared or angry . Maybe it was his first acting job and he was nervous or in disbelief , but it's kind of annoying . Bill Paxton is responsible for the movie's most memorable scenes . He is utterly hilarious and his scenes were usually the only ones I laughed out loud at . Overall this is one of Hughes ' weakest films and it's probably because it was one of his more early directorial works . In terms of character development , "" The Breakfast Club "" reigns supreme . The dialogue isn't that great and the movie is too short and spends too little time with its setup . It's entertaining if you're not looking for anything of substance , but I think if Hughes had tackled this a few years down the road of his career the result would have been a bit more intelligent and memorable .

When he makes it to the village , he finds that the locals are a very off-putting sort , and of no help whatsoever . As the rain continues to fall , he gets the history of the place from "" crazy drunk "" , and seemingly the only normal person in the village , Ezequiel ( Francisco Rabal , who is great ) and discovers not only the incredible secrets of the locals , but the truth about himself . Stuart Gordon once again delivers decent B level horror taking its title from a very brief H . P . Lovecraft short story , but being based more closely on another tale titled "" The Shadow Over Innsmouth "" . The result is a nicely done tale with heavy atmosphere . Production design / art direction and cinematography are excellent ; this is definitely a film with good visuals . The music is quite suitably ominous and the film just builds in intensity as it goes along . It has quite a good feeling of mystery and a heavy accent on mythology and the ultimate revelations are interesting , to say the least . I haven't seen anything quite like "" Dagon "" , which is definitely a good thing . Godden makes for an enjoyable lead in the sense that he's not quite a conventional variety of hero . He's nerdy , jittery , and not really all that likable , but it's easy to share his befuddlement at his situation . Rabal is quite delightful as provider of some of the exposition ( this was one of his final roles , and the film is dedicated to him ) , and Macarena Gomez is lovely and bewitching as the character of Uxia . The effects are a decent combination of traditional makeup and CGI , and the film has a solidly grim and nasty tone that gives it an extra bit of kick . It's good and engaging outrageousness ; with the help of his old cohorts , producer Brian Yuzna and screenwriter Dennis Paoli , Gordon adds another fine H . P . Lovecraft adaptation to his filmography . Godden and Gordon , of course , would go on to work on another Lovecraft adaptation , the ' Masters of Horror ' entry ' Dreams in the Witch-House ' .

Text2: Love that T-shirt , Mr . Haig ! The film-making debut for rocker Rob Zombie ; this film tells the story ( such as it is ) of some Stereotypical Horror Movie Morons who run afoul of some Stereotypical Horror Movie Depraved Redneck Freaks . Two guys and their girlfriends are traveling the country documenting strange roadside attractions and come across Captain Spaulding's ( Sid Haig ) macabre museum . The two guys , idiots that they are , want to investigate a local legend called "" Dr . Satan "" . Turns out to be the worst mistake that they could have made . Although I was honestly annoyed beyond belief after my first viewing , I'll admit that it's grown on me a little . As a horror movie , it's ultimately a failure , because there's no scares or suspense , even though the victims are clearly living through a nightmare . Made in the style of 1970's low-budget horror classics like "" The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "" and "" The Hills Have Eyes "" , "" House of 1 , 000 Corpses "" is actually set in the 1970's , in rural Southwest U . S . A . Of course , Zombie offers many rock video style touches , and throws in a couple of clips from classic movies and series . This movie stars some tolerable newcomers and features some flamboyant performances ( Bill Moseley , as "" Otis "" , is particularly hammy and in-your-face ) by a gaggle of committed B-movie veterans ; makeup effects , character design and set design aren't particularly distinguished , but do show some degree of imagination . The look of "" Dr . Satan "" himself is actually sort of interesting . Although Zombie has yet to really mature as a film-maker , there's no denying from me that he is an artist of a true and unique type . I have his greatest hits CD and regularly enjoy the music . The dialog isn't so hot , and the non-stop profanity is wearying . The film's sense of humor isn't great ; it's too often crude without being genuinely funny . It doesn't help that I couldn't side with any of the characters . The victims were useless ( how can you root for people who don't get out when the getting is good , or at least try to fight back ? ) and the psychos weren't as entertaining as I would have liked . What sort of encouraged me to see it again was the cast who agreed to do the follow-up , "" The Devil's Rejects "" , due for release later this year . Check out the line-up : Sid Haig , Bill Moseley , and Sheri Moon all return , and they're supported by Ken Foree , Michael Berryman , Danny Trejo , William Forsythe , Steve Railsback , Leslie Easterbrook ( That's right ! ' Callahan ' from the "" Police Academy "" movies replaces Karen Black as ' Mother Firefly ' ! ) , Priscilla Barnes , Tyler Mane , Diamond Dallas Page , Mary Woronov , Elizabeth Daily , Rosario Dawson , Natasha Lyonne , Daniel Roebuck , AND P . J . Soles ! Any film with a cast like that is worth checking out in my book . Like I said , it doesn't really cut it as a horror film , but as a twisted , stylized , and graphic little comedy , it has its moments . Weirdest moment : characters get killed while a song by Slim Whitman plays ! Obviously the kind of film that will engender personal reactions . Audience response has mostly been good but of course there are also those who couldn't stand it . I can't of course guarantee that you'll enjoy this film but I wouldn't go out of my way to steer you away from it , not any more .

He works at a detective agency and one day a girl with a bizarre request calls them to a bridge where the ultimate challenge awaits our hero . The story is rather good , and for the most part the game was okay as you could use demons to read people's minds and do various other things . The combat though was a bit of a pain . Not like the other games of the Shin Megemi Tensei name this one relies real time combat . A combat that at times is hard to pinpoint where exactly the enemy is in relationship to you so you end up swinging at air . You also run into very hard battles near the end and you almost always need a healing demon summoned to help you and you only get one demon on screen at a time . The ending to it was not anything special either . I prefer the fights in the other Shin Megemi games as they took more strategy , to many of the fights here turn into slashing away frantically . Still the setting is great in 1900's Japan , it is sort of like the Shadow Heart games in the way it is set in the real world . The music is okay for the most part , but it does get repetitive . Also , I would have like the characters to actually speak lines rather than just word boxes . Still , thanks to the story it is a all right game .

The simple story revolves around the situation of a girl whose pregnancy prompts her boyfriend to suggest an abortion because he's unwilling to commit himself to a relationship . It being the 1960s , the issues are played and discussed in the context of the time which may make the film seem dated now . But it's played with such charm by the two leads and given such a gritty , believable New York City background flavor that the result is a romantic comedy / drama that should appeal to any discriminating movie fan . Although there are some good supporting roles , notably EDIE ADAMS as a showgirl friend , director Robert Mulligan keeps the focus on Natalie and Steve and they're so strong that they make us feel it's a two-character film deserving of all their attention .

Text2: "" The Big Country "" is the grand-daddy of overblown westerns . . . GREGORY PECK's innate ability to play a man of integrity is never better utilized than it is by director William Wyler for THE BIG COUNTRY . In fact , Wyler is able to draw expert performances from all of the male leads , who really do exceptional work here . It's the men who dominate the film and Wyler gives them all a chance to show what they can do . The film itself is a bit overblown , even for an epic western . As the most villainous of BURL IVES ' sons , CHUCK CONNORS stands out in a very aggressive role as the gang of four who welcome Peck to "" the big country "" by taunting him with reckless energy as they lasso him , tear his hat off , shoot at it , keeping his fianc√© , CARROLL BAKER in check to witness their humiliating tactics . But Peck is a gentleman from the east , a Sea Captain returning to the west to marry the woman he thinks he loves and his way of dealing with bullies upsets his fianc√© who fails to understand his values and always underestimates him . As it turns out , JEAN SIMMONS becomes the real woman for him - - and after many a plot turn he ends up rescuing her from a fate worse than death after she's captured by Ives and his unruly , cowardly son Connors . It's a complex story of an age old feud over water rights that involves , principally , Ives and CHARLES BICKFORD as the headstrong men who are unable to settle a score peacefully even when Peck tries to intervene . It's an epic tale , sprawling and a bit rambling over the course of two hours and forty-five minutes , but Wyler holds it all together for maximum interest , aided and abetted by a wonderful western score by Jerome Moross that has become classic . Peck never had a role that suited him so admirably and CHARLTON HESTON is excellent as Bickford's right hand man with unwanted designs on Carroll Baker . His fist fight with Peck is a classic of its kind . And ALFONSO BEDOYA ( tbe grinning bandit from TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE ) as Ramon , the sometimes dull-witted hired help with his halting English , is excellent .

Text2: A major accomplishment ! It took an infinity of imagination to make The Dark Crystal , a film so overflowing with invention that you literally have to watch it about 100 times just to take it all in . Everyone involved , from the director to the best boy gave the film such loving affection and made it the best it could possibly be . Kid's movies ( if you want to call it that ) these days simply are not what they used to be and probably never will be again . This is yet another thing that makes The Dark Crystal so damn precious . The film is set in another world , in another time in an age of wonder . It has been 999 years and 1 year since the powerful , life-giving crystal cracked and stopping shining . Since then the land has become barren and the Urskeks ( a race of God-like beings ) have split into two separate races , the peaceful Uru ' Mystics ' and the evil Skeksis-a horrific cross between bird and reptile . The three suns that shine upon the land are about to line up in a great conjunction that only happens once every 1000 years . If the crystal is not repaired before then the cruel Skeksis will rule the land forever . Jen is a Gelfling ( a sort of fairy creature ) , believed to be the last of his race . A prophecy tells of a single Gelfling defeating the Skeksis and restoring peace to the land . Raised by the Uru , Jen begins a journey to repair the crystal when the Skeksis Emperor dies ( in a truly disturbing scene ) . On his way he meets Aughra , a sort of witch creature and Kira , another Gelfling and her race of Podling people ( sort of like Fraggles ) . Though there is no specific love scene between them , there is a very nice romance developing through-out the story . Filmed in gorgeous locations across England and Scotland ( with the use of a lot of matte paintings of course ) the film really , really does take you to another world . There's not a single human in sight ( a perfect world or what ) and , with exception to the awful Skeksis , almost every creature is cute and fluffy ( such as Kira's Fizzgig ) . The production design , in particular the genius contributions by Brian Froud , is so immense and impressive that you wish you could jump through the screen and actually be there in order to appreciate it more . Trevor Jones ' breathtaking , beautiful score is among his best work ( tying with Merlin in 1998 ) and is surely some of the best film music you are ever likely to hear . Ever ! There was a limited edition of the score put on CD a few years ago but only 5000 were ever printed . It's sure to be quite expensive now but it's so goddamn worth it ! Henson , Oz and Froud teamed up again a few years later to make Labyrinth which seems to be more fondly remembered as it's not as sinister as The Dark Crystal and has human actors in it to make it more accessible to those with narrower minds . I prefer this one though ( no fruity songs , no David Bowie ! ) as it has a certain edge to it that Labyrinth lacks . An epic . A masterpiece . An unforgettable classic . The Dark Crystal is magical , mystical timeless classic . I can't recommend it enough . If only we still had movies like this . I'll take risk-taking The Dark Crystal over PC drek like The Shaggy Dog any day .

939,"Text1: A Voyage Into Danger The Sherlock Holmes Series is actually fun for the fans of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce , but the individual films are a mixed bag as mysteries themselves . The best mysteries are THE SCARLET CLAW , THE HOUSE OF FEAR , THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES , THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES , SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH . The ones about the war are mediocre - more like curiosities dealing with patriotism and the war effort . After the war the series resumed plots dealing with regular crime . The best of these was THE PEARL OF DEATH , but it was not up to the top five films . One of the final films was this one , PURSUIT TO ALGIERS . Although all the other films were rewritten from the original Conan Doyle stories , PURSUIT TO ALGIERS was totally made up from a comment dropped in the original "" Canon "" . Doyle wrote four novels and fifty six short stories about Holmes . But in this material ( equal in size to say LES MISERABLES or DON QUIXOTE ) were many little comments and statements that actually have helped lead to the myriad of essays and books by Holmes ' fans . Among other things are the large number of cases of Holmes that he or Watson mention casually , but never write of . In this film , the untold story is "" the affair of the steamship "" Friesland "" that so nearly cost us both our lives "" . It is mentioned in one of the stories of the series called THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES , and is usually said to be set in 1895 . The actions of PURSUIT TO ALGIERS take place on the steamship "" Friesland "" , and do almost cost Holmes and Watson their lives , but this film is set after the end of World War II . Since there was no real short story that is nothing to be critical about . Holmes is not in part of the film ( and at one point it seems he has been killed ) , but he does appear about the middle , and he is in good form when he is . Witness the way he takes care of Martin Kosleck , and the way he makes a typically ironic comment to Kosleck as to why he was able to be prepared . Also the business about party favors is quite nicely done . So are the supporting parts - especially Bruce's comments regarding Rosalind Ivan and John Abbott and his partner . As an entertainment it is a fine film . As a mystery it really never gets very involving . We never understand who is in the background backing the anti-royal assassins . Presumably the Communists ( this is 1945 ) , but such a guess is based on the number of Eastern European monarchies that fell following the end of World War II . Still it would help to know who the super-villain is . But then Hitchcock always ignored the central rationales of his "" MacGuffins "" . Why not on this lesser level then ? So forget the pleasure of realism , sit back , and just enjoy the antics of the characters . And keep in mind , Basil and Nigel made only two other of these films afterward . It was nearly the end of the series for them and their fans .

Of course this is all clich√© by now , and some viewers will bemoan that fact and give up right there , but the TV film "" A Change of Heart "" addresses these issues with a lot of forceful emotion and realistic exchanges .

Today , yikes . . . . this film goes by at a snail's pace and features two annoying main characters that make this a dud , not the revered classic gem that is supposed to be . There is nothing wrong with the hero , played by Gary Cooper . His overall presence - the way he handles himself , the expressions on his face , etc . - make him a believable and likable character , as he was in most of his films . Grace Kelly certainly is easy on the eyes ( I'm a male ) but her character in here is unbelievably shallow and annoying . She plays Cooper's wife and , get this - five minutes after she marries him , she wants to leave him because he decides he has to stay and fight off the bad man who is coming to town to kill him . Talk about devotion ! Talk about commitment ! No wonder marriage was never taken seriously in Hollywood and its films . The other characters who gets decent screen time is a whining punk with a chip of his shoulder . Lloyd Bridges plays that role effectively but his character wears thin quickly . The rest of the star-studded cast have very small roles , unfortunately . The movie is played out in "" real time . "" Watching an hour-and-a-half of this might be worth your real time if you are hoping to take a nap and need some help


Text2: Don't Give This The Brush This is a movie that just begs for someone to observe how FRENCH it is , the implication being that other countries somehow can't get their celluloid souffles to rise quite like the Gauls . Be that as it may this IS , I suppose , typically French , whatever that means . Sabine Azema and Daniel Auteuil are a well-heeled couple of the ' early retirement ' school . Azema likes to dabble in landscapes and whilst she is thus occupied a blind man ( Sergi Lopez ) tells her and shows - if that is the right word - her a house that is for sale . In nothing flat she and Auteuil are installed and beginning a new life in which Lopez and his wife ( Amira Casar ) quickly become their new best friends and in the fullness of time - probably about two or three months - it's wife-swapping time . Azema and Auteuil take to this like ducks to water so much so that they're soon advertising for like-minded couples . If it sounds sordid on the page it doesn't come across like that on the screen , possibly because it's French . All the principals are on top of their game and Casar proves that there IS life after Catherine Breillat . Well worth a look .

941,"Text1: And when the night is cloudy . . . . Gabin won the Volpi Cup at the Venice film festival and he thoroughly deserved it . "" La Nuit est mon Royaume "" , in spite of occasional snatches of melodrama , is a strong film about blind people . The title tells the whole story : the night is my kingdom ( and not my hell ) . In the film , all the blind people lead a normal life , they work , they love , they suffer , but above all , they do not want any pity . That was Raymond's family's first mistake : after an accident which made him a blind man , the hero is treated like a child . "" He's going to break my glasses ! "" mama says "" You should eat more . Do you want me to cut your meat ? "" . But fortunately , a nun comes to his rescue . She works in a center where blind people learn to read with the Braille alphabet , but , as the sister tells Raymond , they learn any job they like : cabinet-makers , mechanics , cooks , etc . She will play for Raymond the role Annie Sullivan played for Helen Keller . And there's another light that shines on Raymond : in the center , there's a blind schoolteacher he falls in love with . But she's the head's fianc√©e . This rivalry is perhaps the weakness of the film , but it does produce a marvelous scene : Raymond and the girl are walking though the wood and he confides in her ; the jealous suitor is here but of course they cannot see him . Georges Lacombe was a talented director with a good sense of mystery ( which surfaces in this film ) . He made the best of a good cast : Gabin , Simone Val√®re , Suzanne Dehelly , G√©rard Oury - yes the director who hit the big time with his Bourvil / De Fun√®s comedies - . His movie displayed humanism , close to that of Christian-Jaque and Jean-Paul Le Chanois : a splendid sequence shows a choir of blind people singing "" Ce N'Est Qu'un Au Revoir "" ( = "" Should auld acquaintance be forgot ? ) . Charles Spaak ' s dialog , by and large , rings true . Like his colleague Henri Jeanson , he laughed at the Legion d'Honneur . After his pompous speech about Raymond's courage , the minister is in a hurry to leave , much to the hero's brother-in-law's disappointment , he who was counting on him to get a promotion in his bank .


Text2: A Mawkish Bit of Utter Cheese Poor Shirley MacLaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish , gag-inducing "" feel-good "" movie , but she's trampled by the run-away sentimentality of a film that's not the least bit grounded in reality . This was directed by Curtis Hanson ? Did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him ? Hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy , as evidenced by "" Wonder Boys . "" So I don't know what happened to him here . This is the kind of movie that doesn't want to accept that life is messy and fussy , and that neat , tidy endings ( however implausible they might be ) might make for a nice closing shot , but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through . My wife and I made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred - - e . g . "" the old man's going to teach her to read and then drop dead . "" Bingo ! This is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems , making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they're that aware of what's causing them . Toni Collette ( a fine actress , by the way , and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here ) , gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them , spelling out in flashing neon the film's awkward connecting motif . At that moment , I knew what I was in for , and the film was a downward spiral from there .

James Spader ( John / Rick Westford ) "" I Witness "" ' 03 , gave a great dual performance and is a great up and coming actor along with Cynthia Gibb ( Chris Moscari ) "" A Crime of Passion "" ' 03 TV , who loved John Westford and became very close with Rick .

DeMille directed a film with a cast of all time giants of the movie screen , Gary Cooper , Paulette Goddard , Boris Karloff , Ward Bond and even Katherine DeMille .

In 1763 in colonial America , Martin Garth ( howard Da Silva ) , a trader , secretly trades guns to the Indians in order to stop the westward movement of settlers , Garth tries to purchase young Abby Hale ( Paulette Goddard ) , a British servant for his own interests , but a Virginia Capt . Christopher Holden ( Gary Cooper ) , outbids the trader and then frees her . Garth encourages an Indian rebellion on Fort Pitt led by Chief Guyasuta ( Boris Karloff ) .

943,"Text1: It just couldn't grab me . Normally I enjoy watching old movies from the ' 20's , even the more slower paced one's but this movie just didn't do it for me , although it also is of course far from the worst I have ever seen . The movie has a good enough story but it isn't exactly the most intriguing or tense stories to follow . Lots of sequences don't seem to have a relevant enough importance . It might have to do with the fact that the original length of the movie was over 6 hours long , which might had shown some of the relevance of certain sequences and characters but there is really no way I'm ever going to watch this longer version . The movie was already overlong as it was . The movie didn't had very much interesting drama in it and although the main character seemed intriguing , it just didn't worked out powerful enough in the movie . The movie also isn't as technically advanced as some of the other movies from the same time period , clearly directed by more talented and more experimental directors such as F . W . Murnau , Fritz Lang , Victor Sj√∂str√∂m and D . W . Griffith , among others . But this all of course doesn't mean that the movie is a bad one to watch . The story of a fake Russian aristocratic lady-killer in Monte Carlo trying to get money from rich ladies as on its own quite a good story and in a way for movie standards also ahead of its time . Many more movies like this one , in many different forms were made and are still being made , many years later now . In this particular case this is a movie I wouldn't mind seeing remade , perhaps also with some more humor in it and a more clear message . The movie also uses some quite good camera positions , on a positive note . Also the acting is good enough , though Miss DuPont seems heavily miscast as a pretty 21 year young girl . She is too old looking for her role and she also most certainly wasn't pretty enough to find the story very convincing . Same perhaps goes for Dale Fuller . Erich von Stroheim plays the real main part of the movie and he does this with lots of flair . He also wrote and directed the movie . Laurel & Hardy regular Mae Busch shows up in a serious role for a change and it was refreshing to see her like that for a change . Certainly a watchable movie but really no essential viewing in my opinion .


Text2: Very simplistic but it works because of that . The movie is obviously inspired by "" Night of the Living Dead "" , in which lots of simple , gory and mysterious things are happening , at one location , without ever trying to explain anything . It's a very simply approach , that works out for this movie as well . You just sit back and enjoy watching it , without really having to think much about anything . The movie is definitely gory and good looking enough to please the genre fans . It's definitely a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and leaves room for lots of humor and over-the-top characters . It makes the movie fun and entertaining to watch . But yes the movie is pretty restrained because of its one location and in its originality . It also makes the movie drag on a bit after a while . Basically the movie doesn't offer too much new elements and most of it has already been done before and in a better and more original way . Nevertheless this doesn't mean that this movie has completely nothing to offer to thrill its audience . It definitely helps that the movie is a good looking one as well , despite its low budget . It also provides the movie with a good and suiting horror type of atmosphere , even though the movie doesn't really ever become scary . It's too deliberately gory and fun for that . The build up and character introductions take far too long . For the rest of the movie it keeps focusing on all characters evenly . This is a bit of a problem because there are really many characters in this movie and none of them really gets developed or interesting because they are never given the room to . It's now hard to keep all characters apart and really care for any of them . An enjoyable gore feast but perhaps for fans only .

945,"Text1: Rather good military horror movie This movie is kind of a combination of a couple of other movies . "" Dog Soldiers "" , "" R-Point "" , and "" Shock Waves "" . The story has these mercenaries escorting this one guy to this area of woods in the middle of a war torn country . Once they get there , the hardest part of the job should be over , but not quite . In the middle of this field there is an underground bunker and what this man who hired the soldiers wants is apparently there . The soldiers soon are fired upon by unknown assailants and they also discover a collection of bodies , that even includes someone alive . Well they soon discover this place was a Nazi bunker and the one guy is there to find out just what the German's were experimenting with . Let's just say it was not quite what I was thinking , but then it was . There are things lurking about and they begin to kill the mercenaries , just what they are is not quite clear even after the explanation . However , it is a bit more original than the typical zombie . The movie has a couple of faults though , one the set up is a bit long . It takes a good bit for the movie to get going , though once it gets going your in for a lot of action and blood . I also was not thrilled with the ending , though that is just a minor gripe , it was not all that bad , but I was hoping for a different outcome .

Text2: After a more recent viewing of this movie , I rather liked it . My first review of this movie was made when I had not seen this movie in at least ten years . I recently purchased it with the original Japanese voice track and I did enjoy it . Nothing to take seriously , but it is a Godzilla movie . Here we have a couple of guys that were in a dance contest helping this one guy by showing him a boat . The guy never tells them why , but it is to find his brother who was lost at sea . They find a boat and a person who seems to be the owner , although he seems a bit shady . He says they can sleep on the boat , but they must leave in the morning . The guy searching for his brother though sets them out to sea and our story really begins . They find an island , controlled by a terrorist organization known as the "" red bamboo "" . They have been using natives of nearby infant island as slaves to produce a special liquid . You see , this island is protected by the sea monster Ebirah , a giant lobster . It attacks everything that comes into its vicinity including the smallest of boats . In fact , it wrecks the four men who were in search of the one guys brother . While on the island , they join up with a native girl that escapes the "" red bamboo "" . They do some investigating and shockingly find an amazing discovery in the caves of the island . . . Godzilla asleep . Through a series of incidents involving almost getting captured our heroes must wake the giant beast up as a little distraction .

946,"Text1: One Man's Terrifying Vengeance A perfect film . Martin Scorsese displays complete mastery over his medium in this deeply disturbing 1976 masterpiece , and to my mind hasn't yet made another movie as good as this one ( no , not even "" Raging Bull "" ) . In "" Taxi Driver , "" Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle , a Vietnam veteran who drives a cab for a living . Isolated and lonely , Travis prowls the hellish streets of New York's worst neighborhoods , willing to drive customers anywhere they want to go , quietly nurturing vague fantasies of vengeance on what he perceives to be a sick culture . The whole movie is a nightmarish fever dream . I've never seen anyone capture visually what on the page would be stream of consciousness narration as well as Scorsese does here . And De Niro gives the performance of his , or anybody else's , career . His Travis is a fascinating creation , and one of the most frightening screen characters in the history of cinema . No one could keep me up nights quite like the seemingly ordinary Joe who's ready to snap at any moment and feels that his grisly duty is handed down to him from on high . Cybill Shepherd plays Travis's nominal love interest with just the right amount of vapidity , and Jodie Foster , in a small , sweet and wonderful performance , plays Iris , the thirteen-year-old prostitute who becomes the object Travis sets out to save from the rotten world that has turned him into what he is . And the late Peter Boyle has a couple of beautiful moments as Travis's fellow cab driver , who tries to give him some counsel but is so obviously out of his league . Shortly after "" Taxi Driver "" hit screens , Vietnam turned into a subject that film makers felt comfortable addressing directly ( "" Coming Home , "" "" Apocalypse Now , "" "" The Deer Hunter "" ) . But none of these , though so much more actually ABOUT Vietnam , addressed half as well as "" Taxi Driver "" the toll that that conflict took on the men it sent back home .


Text2: Inside Hollywood A truly memorable film with tough and rugged , but hardly handsome , Jack Palance as Charlie Castle playing of all people an actor who's always playing matin√©e Idols and great lovers . As Charlie's boss and studio owner Stanley Hoff , Rod Steiger , says of him throughout the film : "" He makes all the women of America heart's swoon "" . "" The Big Knife "" is worth the price of admission just to see how and if director Robert Aldrich can pull it off and make the film both entertaining and believable . You see Charlie is getting tired of playing all those roles over the years as a heart throb to the women of America and wants to get out of his contract with the Hoff Studios and go independent ; That was a big thing for actors back in the 1950's . Charlie wan't to do films that are worthy of his extraordinary talents as a serious and Shakespearian actor . It's that Charlie's off the wall and possessive boss Stanley Hoff , the Big Knife , doesn't want his meal ticket to leave and take his fans with him ! So Stanley rolls out the heavy artillery and plays his trump card . It seems that Charlie has a dark secret that the studio has been covering up for years and if Charlie leaves that secret won't be a secret any more ! Get It Charlie ! The film "" The Big Knife "" can really be described as one of the most multi storied soap operas ever put on film with the audience needing score cards just to keep up with the story and even then they'll get lost . Whoever coined the phrase "" Seeing is believing "" must have based it the the incredible performance of Rod Steiger's Stanley Hoff which goes from a Saturday Night Live impersonation shtick of a big Hollywood producer to an Oscar winning interpretation of Hamlet all at the same time ! It's really incredible to watch and believe what your seeing in Steiger's over the top performance . And Jack Palance , determined not to be shown up his co-star , really did pull it off in him Playing a role so out of character and yet evoking real sympathy from the audience ! As the tortured soul with a dark past who only wanted to do Art Films and get away from playing debonair and charming movie parts that make women go ape over him . In the end of the film when Palance went all out , or was it underwater , in the final few minutes of the movie he was so convincing that I just couldn't keep the tears from rolling down my cheeks . No matter how much people criticize Robert Aldrich's "" The Big Knife "" , and with good justification , this is one movie where you can really say that the acting actually overwhelmed the script !

Text2: "" We might aspire to be good but our real fascination lies with evil . "" I thought it was decent . The Final Conflict sees the Antichrist Damien Thorn ( Sam Neill ) now 32 years old & has him wanting to be the American ambassador to Britain , by a complete coincidence the current ambassador ( Robert Arden ) has an unfortunate incident which leaves him with his brains splattered on a wall & as a result the President ( Mason Adams ) does then indeed give Damien the job . Taking the position Damien moves to London & becomes romantically involved with a TV news-reporter named Kate Reynolds ( Lisa Harrow ) , however he has bigger issues on his mind as a triangular star configuration signals the birth of the second coming of Christ somewhere in Britain so he orders his worshippers to kill every baby boy born on the same night . If that wasn't enough a group of seven priest's from Italy now possess the seven daggers of Meggido which are the only things on Earth which can kill Damien & are on a mission to do just that , an Antichrist's life is just never easy is it ? This English American co-production was directed by Graham Baker & I actually thought it was a decent horror film that passed the time harmlessly enough . The Final Conflict was the third entry in The Omen ( 1976 ) series of films & while probably not quite as good as the previous two films I don't think it deserves some of the stick it gets , I mean what about Omen IV : The Awakening ( 1991 ) for heavens sake ? Anyway , the script by Andrew Birkin now has Damien the Antichrist as an adult who has to fend of killer priest's & the birth of the new Christ as well as continuing his quest to wipe out mankind . The one area where The Final Conflict disappoints is that it's not done on a grand enough scale , for a film that supposedly deals with the end of the World & ancient religious prophecy's it all feels very flat , empty & a bit too basic . For the majority of the film the script offers nothing more than a string of novelty supernatural set-piece deaths which are good to watch but they don't really drive the central story forward until the birth of the second Christ but even then this seems like just an excuse for more deaths & nothing significant becomes of it . Don't get me wrong because as a horror fan I love death , gore & mutilation but I must admit I expected something with a bit more resonance . The character's & dialogue are OK but apart from Damien they don't stand out , it moves along at a fair pace & has entertainment value although I did think it was a bit too long & the climax is a big let down . Director Baker does a decent job & the film has a nice basic but quite stylish look about it . There isn't much continuity between The Final Conflict & the other Omen films , for instance according to the original Omen the Antichrist Damien was born on the 6th June 1966 yet here The Final Conflict is set in 1982 & he is said to be 32 years old , not that it really matters though . There's a decent atmosphere although I can't say it's particularly scary or tension filled & that ending is very weak which really hurts the film as a whole because you are then stuck with negative feelings as the end credits roll despite what has gone before being alright . There's some good gore here including a burnt corpse & a great scene where someone gorily has their brains blown out ( I then love how his leg twitches ! ) which is one of those cool film moment bits that is definitely worth watching on DVD & slow-motioning it . Technically The Final Conflict is well made & it obvious had a decent budget . Largely shot in England in London & Cornwall the scenery is nice enough although as a side note Fox hunting as shown in The Final Conflict has since been made illegal so you animal lovers out there needn't worry about such things anymore . . . The acting is OK but no one stood out apart from Sam Neill in his first starring role & he would obviously go on to achieve lots of success as an actor unlike anyone else in this film .

Text2: A neat little Italian crime drama Honest , dedicated Commissioner Bonavia ( superbly played by Martin Balsam ) risks both his life and career in order to arrest wily , powerful and evasive mobster Ferdinando D'Ambrosio ( a marvelously slimy portrayal by Luciano Catenacci ) . Bonavia clashes with shrewd , smooth and by-the-book young district attorney Traini ( the always fine Franco Nero ) over the questionable methods he uses to nab D'Ambrosio . Director Damiano Damiani , who also co-wrote the sharp , complex and intriguing script with Salvatore Laurani , relates the absorbing story at a steady pace and does an expert job of maintaining a serious and gritty tone throughout . The uniformly sound acting from a tip-top cast rates as another substantial plus : Balsam and Nero both excel in their meaty roles , with fine support from Marilu Tolo as D'Ambrosio's frightened old flame Serena LiPuma , Giancarlo Prete as gutsy union organizer Rizzo , Claudio Gora as crooked attorney general Judge Malta , Arturo Dominici as shifty mafia shyster lawyer Canistraro , and Adolfo Lastretti as dangerous , unhinged hoodlum LiPuma . Both Riz Ortolani's moody , melodic score and Claudio Ragona's polished cinematography are up to speed . The potent central message about pervasive corruption and travesties of justice packs one hell of a strong punch . Moreover , the film's tough , no-nonsense sensibility stays grimly true to itself to the literal bitter end . Those expecting your usual nasty and sleazy shoot ' em up action picture will be disappointed , but fans of more demanding and complicated fare should appreciate this admirably ambitious and intelligent character study of two radically contrasting law enforcers .

At 70 Carlin bounces back from the level of despair ( and some of the stumbles in the act itself ) from Life is Worth Losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful - or as much as the "" old f "" can get - and is continuously , ceaselessly , funny . And funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching Back in Town or ' Diseased ' the first time . The material , even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done ( i . e . the whole bit on children in school and camp like the Children segment in Diseased ) , is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while ( here goes ) tickling the funny bone . Going from the topic of death ( how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book ? six weeks , unless if on the computer scheduler ) , the facets of communication , looking down from Heaven , spots of God ( naturally ) , kids , and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have "" Rights "" make up the bulk of the special , centered around the premise that what's bad for you , plain and simple , is BS . Total , complete BS , which as we also learn ( or if you've really learned it you're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not-quite randomly by the parent ) holds the country together . Carlin isn't necessarily angry though , even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns , even just to observe how horrifying children's teeth coming in look . It's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is NOT going to be "" fine "" . What it comes down to is this : Carlin is to dirty , witty , cautionary stand-up comedy what Yoda is to Jedis everywhere , which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any . At the least , we get classic GC - outrageous lines and bits from the man's 13th ( or is it 14th ) comedy special , including as far as an eyebrow-raising observation on people who play Mozart music during a birth !


Text2: still likely the Strangest film I Have Ever Seen David Lynch's Eraserhead makes Being John Malkovich , Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Lost Highway ( another Lynch flick ) combined look like they are chicken feed . And years later , having immersed myself in all of Lynch's work ( minus Twin Peaks ) , going through numerous other "" cult "" and nightmarish films , and even recognizing the slower bits in the film , it still holds up for me as one of the filmmaker's masterpieces . Believe me , you will rarely see a stranger and more terrifying film in your lifetime until you see this . The plot ( which if you can find you win a prize in your mind I think ) has a weird zombie-like man ( with a Al Sharpton like hair-do ) who accidentally gets his spastic girlfriend pregnant and what comes out is a creature that is probably the unwanted child of an alien and a gasoline can . For most of the film though are images and scenes of macabre and fright that are authentic in their own way ; abstractions that sometimes are humorous ( the best being the highly uncomfortable and classic scene at dinner with the chickens ) and sometimes purely out-of-this world . Lynch , while artistically might be by this work as mentally balanced as The Monster in Frankenstein , can make a film so weird , evil-feeling , yet compelling as all hell , that it boggles the mind . Very low budget , this is definitely one of the top 10 best debut films ever .

950,"Text1: A pretty good romantic comedy I have never really liked romantic comedies , I think there's too much crying and sentimental sap . I mostly think of romantic comedies as the kind of movie single women sit down and watch , and cry their eyes out , which is a concept I've never understood . But this movie is definitely one of the better of the genre . I saw it again after having seen it a lot of years ago , and I remembered it as having one single good scene . This is , of course , the famous restaurant scene . But seeing it again , I laughed almost at the very beginning , and kept laughing throughout the next twenty minutes . After that , the hilarity of the characters faded , and it settled by being interesting and capturing . I wanted to know what was going to happen to these characters . Unfortunately , it didn't last , and I lost interest for a few minutes , and then I saw a funny scene again , and regained interest . The same thing happened a few more times , I lost and regained interest with brief pauses . The movie is worth seeing if you like this sort of movie , or if you like debates about male / female friendship . I found the ongoing debate in the movie very interesting and thought-provoking , and most of the movie is pretty funny as well . Some of it is laugh-out-loud funny , and some of it is more like recognize-the-situation funny . If it had kept my interest a little better , I would have given it an 8 , but as it is , I give it .

This does not adopt the candid tone of aforementioned , but rather goes about its objective in the more traditional way , and hey , which way you prefer is entirely up to the individual viewer . This consists of behind-the-scenes footage , stills , interviews and film clips , some inter-cut with each other . The new faces in the cast aren't too bad to listen to , though Cumming doesn't come off as having a lot to say , here . . . Hu is perhaps the best of them ( and Stanford is pretty good ) . The writers and such are quite good , as is Singer . The overall focus / tone is perhaps somewhat loose , which is not to say that the editing isn't tight ( it is ) . Some material of the rehearsal and / or planning of stunts and effects is included . The entire thing is fairly nicely put together , and does have info . I wouldn't call this memorable , but it's got a reasonable pace ( 59 minute running time and I was never bored ) , and it's worth watching for any fan and anyone who wants to know more about the film . I recommend this to anyone who fits into either or both groups .

951,"Text1: Mmm . Two Scoops . What a good movie . It's hard to believe that the audience was considered so sensitive in 1947 that the original title , "" Ace in the Hole , "" had to be dropped and replaced with this less ironic one . Viewers were thought unprepared for a film in which a reporter misbehaved , with lethal results . "" The Big Carnival "" is one of the reasons the director , Billy Wilder , earned a reputation as a cynic . It was probably deserved . He had a keen sense of humor as well ( Wilder : "" I laugh at everything . I laugh at Hamlet . "" ) but it's not much on display here . Instead we have a naive veteran pinned underground and an ambitious reporter ( Kirk Douglas ) who deliberately delays the rescue in order to squeeze the most out of the story . Poor Louie Minosa . He catches pneumonia and dies after being given extreme unction . Douglas dies too , as the code of the time required . Wilder's direction is fine . Douglas acquires a young acolyte and when they last speak together , the light is behind Douglas so that Douglas's sharp shadow blacks out almost all of the kid's face . In the last shot , from floor level , Douglas collapses and his dead face flops almost into the camera lens although the face is too dark to make out , his features , like his soul , in deep shadow . In another scene , Douglas is busily reading his mail and concocting additional material for the Big Story . Douglas again is in deep shadow . Beside him is the bright figure of Louie Minosa's wife , the trashy , blond Jan Sterling . She's a tough and narcissistic cookie out of Baltimore and , impressed by Douglas's power and his ability to bring in the bucks , she comes on to him with a wide and seductive smile . Douglas looks at her over his shoulder and says , "" You're the grief-stricken wife , so stop smiling . "" "" Make me , "" she replies , and he slaps her twice , hard , across the face . It's a shocking moment and , despite Douglas's earlier chatter about his ambitions , the viewer suddenly realizes that this guy will stop at nothing . That is , he not only claims to be ruthless , he really MEANS it . "" That's the expression I want to see , "" Douglas tells her smoothly . "" Don't wipe those tears away . "" Everyone gives performances that are at least decent . Porter Hall , whom you will recognize , does a comic / dramatic turn as the stuffy and conservative editor of an Albaquerque newspaper . One of the few chuckles the viewer is given is when Douglas first asks Porter for a job and analyzes Porter as a small-time fellow because he wears both belt AND suspenders , compared to Douglas's flashy suit . A year goes by and we see Douglas too wearing both belt and suspenders . ( He shucks the suspenders when he gets a job offer from New York . ) This is a finely made movie about two parallel scoops : an attempt to dig Louie Minosa out of his underground prison and Douglas's attempt to turn the story into a heady drama .


Text2: Grappling With Hormones . Alison Folland is a young woman in a shabby section of New York who , after a tempestuous friendship with blond , impatient Tara Subkoff , and the murder of her gay buddy Luke , comes to terms with her own lesbianism and finds a happy and accommodating partner in Lucy , a band leader in a place that looks like the Swing Rendezvous in the Village used to look . Maybe that makes it sound more complicated than it is . It's really a rather simple movie , a little pedantic , a delicate character study rather than a mystery or action movie . Roughly speaking , all the gays are good and all the straight people are messed up . That's not too hard to follow , is it ? Well , there are a couple of exceptions , but not many . Don , the Italian owner of the pizza restaurant where Alison and a gay guy both work , is straight but sympathetic . He's briefly in about four scenes . But it's hard to care about Don's character one way or the other because he serves up these GREAT pizzas ( we only get a glimpse but can practically smell it ) that make Domino's and Pizza Hut look like impostors . Try to get a pizza like that at four in the morning in northern Scotland ! The rest of the straight guys are represented by the boyfriend of Alison's mother , who , in the absence of the mother , begins dangling his insinuations in front of the girl herself , who looks about 16 . The straight adolescent goons who ball Subkoff when they feel like it and throw her out when they're bored with her are little more than perambulating pustules . Folland plays a dumpy adolescent who is shy but sensitive . In fact , however , she has a splendid face with modelesque features , fey and pixie-like . Her bone structure is pretty big though and , alas , the configuration of her weight suggests a strong genetic component . There won't be much she'll be able to do about it . It shouldn't matter , but it always does . Subkoff , her inconstant adolescent friend , has a more conventional and rather skinny figure but her voice , features , and demeanor are coarser than Folland's . She looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer if Buffy were the vampire instead of the slayer . She has probably the most demanding role in the film and brings it off marvelously , a complex character very nicely rendered . The photography and location shooting are just fine . And the movie does middle-class urban dwellers a big favor . You know those young chicks you see on the streets ? The ones with violently pink hair done up in a fashion resembling a tangled mop ? The ones with maybe a jail-house tat around their biceps ? With their clothes half drooping off and that silver ring dangling from their pipiks ? Well , only some of them are dangerous stoners . Many of them are just playing with their appearance , as adolescents are want to do in all cultures , and they may be a little thoughtless but fundamentally decent people . I'd watch out for the guys though , especially if they're straight . They have a slight tendency to murder people they find offensive . At least that's what the film suggests .

952,"Text1: An excellent surrealist fantasy I can't say that I'm a big fan of director Luis Bu√±uel . While I admire his visual flair - his movies often lack backbone , and this brings them down . The Exterminating Angel is the first Bu√±uel movie that I've really enjoyed . I enjoyed it because I never got the impression that the point of this film was simply to be weird . Bu√±uel has found a premise - basically , a satire on the behaviour of the upper class - and lampooned it brilliantly . The key to this movie is setting up the central plot , and the director does such a good job of it that after a while ; we don't care that the film is based on an idea that makes no sense at all , and are just able to run with it . The film follows a bunch of guests at a dinner party . At the end of the party , none of them make any effort to go home and after a while it becomes apparent to the party that they physically cannot leave the room . We then watch as the upper class , people who are used to sipping champagne and smoking expensive cigars are reduced to surviving in the most basic ways . They have to hack through the wall to find a water pipe and even begin eating paper to quench their hunger ? The satire works because the acting is just so different to the way that the upper class usually conduct themselves - either on screen or otherwise . The structure of the social classes is clearly defined by Bu√±uel's film also . This is the sort of thing that would really scare the rich , while other social classes have other things to worry about . Before the nightmare begins , various people are commenting on the conduct of one of their own who has had slightly too much to drink . This wouldn't worry anyone who isn't ' high society ' , but the fact that these people do care about it shows the difference in values between the classes . Bu√±uel directs the film with almost a complete lack of emotion towards the central ensemble - and this stood out to me as it really allows the film to be funny . It's almost like the director is laughing at the situation that he's put his cast of characters into , which suggests that the Spanish director isn't the biggest fan of the upper classes . There's a million and one ways that this film could be interpreted , and that is what makes it great . If you don't like films that don't make sense ; this probably won't do much for you . However , I think that this is one of those films that need to be experienced ; and I definitely recommend it .


Text2: Dull , uninspired , unoriginal , dreary , messy , tedious little mystery flick What we have here is another religion-themed mystery horror movie that is neither as successful as the films it's copying nor as inspired as it thinks it is . This film was released around four years ago , but I suspect that it has ran into some distribution problems as the film still doesn't have a wide release . This is no loss to anyone . The film ponders along a plot line of mystery mixed with horror elements , or rather tries to ; it actually comes out like a standard drama where someone is seeing ' visions ' . The plot is messy throughout , and even though it's not heavy going - getting confused is easy as several plot points just sort of spring up without much explanation . The plot follows a girl who gets hit by a car . After suffering only minor wounds , and amnesia , the woman who hit her takes the girl back to her place ; where she is given the job of nanny for the two children , despite the fact that not even the girl herself really knows who she is . This is lumped in with a religion themed plot about a ' gathering ' of people who watched Christ die on the cross . The main selling point of The Gathering is , of course , the fact that it stars Christina Ricci . Ricci tries to look enthusiastic about her role , but her performance only ever comes across as being forced ; and you don't get the idea that she was particularly fascinated by this film . I can't blame her . Personally , I think she should get a better agent , as she's not been getting the good roles in recent years . A saving grace for the film , for me anyway , is the fact that it's set in Britain and benefits from a distinctly Brit style . Many British films don't make proper use of the location , but at least this one mostly does . The horror is incredibly ineffective , with most of it stemming from the dull central character seeing things idea . I'd even go as far as to say that this isn't really a horror film , as the major focus is always on the plight of the lead character . But then again , it doesn't work as a drama either - the plot is too uninteresting , and it's clear that director Brian Gilbert didn't really know what he wanted his film to be . On the whole , The Gathering is a messy , aimless and dull ' mystery ' film that isn't worth seeing . Avoid , is my advice .

953,"Text1: Who needs a plot when you already have an appealing title ? "" Sorority House Massacre "" is a teen-slasher as eighties as they come ! Academy girls with humongous hairdos and bad dress codes , accompanied by dorky-looking boys trying to get into their panties ! All brought together in a sorority house during a lonely Fourth of July weekend while an escaped lunatic is trying to break in to settle an old score . It nearly is the same storyline than a thousand other horror films but this particular movie is even shameless enough to borrow elements from the two most eminent slashers in cinema . The killer is hunting down his youngest sister who was the sole survivor of his initial rampage . Mute and seemly emotionless he goes straight to her ? Did I hear someone saying Michael Myers ? ? If that isn't enough , our heroine also suffers from terrifying nightmares which makes her somewhat look like a lost cast-member of "" Nightmare on Elm Street "" . Okay , I can't be too harsh on fun thingies like this and it's generally known that 80's horror rarely is top notch cinema . Still , I'm disappointed that the makers of this didn't pay a little more attention to the actual murders . This kind of films can only distinguish themselves from the rest by showing creative bloodshed and flamboyant butchering , but Sorority House Massacre only features tame and uninspired killings . We need more blood ! Despite the promising sounding title , you shouldn't count too much on gratuitous nudity , neither , as the rancidness is limited to one unnecessary dress up party ( by the way , why are all the popular and sexy coeds named Cindy ? ) Come to think of it ? there actually isn't one good reason why you should see this film . Except maybe that I have to admit it has a good tempo and reasonably good acting by the lead girl . Even though every situation was d√©j√† vu and every plot twist was repetitive , Sorority House Massacre certainly isn't the worst film in its kind .


Text2: Going down with all hands and hairy legs on board . . . The first "" Spiders "" is one of my guiltiest guilty pleasures in the horror genre , simply because that movie is just too stupid NOT to enjoy ! It had grotesque special effects , featured every single clich√© of the freshly revived creature-feature sub genre and it never took itself too seriously , which resulted in a fairly entertaining & campy flick . Part two regretfully is the complete opposite of all that . It tries to be scary and original , which is a pretty bad approach if you're dealing with mutated spiders that look as gigantic as a house ! Despite the remotely promising opening sequences ( featuring an authentic pirate attack ! ) and a lot of gory killings near the end , "" Spiders 2 "" is also a very boring film and that's really unforgivable for a post-2000 horror production . The sail boat of a young couple sinks during a storm but they're rescued by a huge cargo ship . The exclusively male crew members are insufferably friendly even though it's more than obvious that they're naughty villains , especially the annoying captain of the ship and the stereotypical mad doctor with the white beard . It takes another tedious half hour before it's confirmed that the cargo ship actually is a floating research lab where the sinister scientist feeds human bodies to over-sized tarantulas . The ramshackle old cargo ship forms an interesting location , but crap-director Sam Firstenberg nearly isn't talented enough to make full use of it . The CGI-effects are atrocious , as are the acting performances and it's really pathetic to see how everyone involved in this Nu-Image production takes this thing so damn seriously .

He tries to end the affair , but the woman will have none of that . She sets the house on fire killing his wife and child . Burned beyond recognition , the man vows revenge against his former lover . Overall , Pyro is a nice little horror / thriller . The plot , although predictable , is generally well paced and only gets bogged down by the love story on one or two brief occasions . It's the predictability that keeps me from rating Pyro much higher . There are a few chills to be had like the scene where the woman runs in fear down a deserted street at night , afraid that her disfigured lover is about the catch-up with her . The acting is a notch or two above what I have seen in other early Spanish horror films . Both Barry Sullivan and Martha Hyer give excellent performances in the lead roles . Hyer , in particular , is wonderful as the scheming , murderous ex-lover . Finally , the burn make-up is effectively creepy . It's the stuff of nightmares . A couple bits of trivia ? first , apparently Pyro was the first horror / thriller movie to be filmed in Spain . Whether it's true or not , I don't know . I just thought it was interesting . Second , cult fans may be interested in catching Pyro to see a young , pre-Franco Soledad Miranda in a small role . She doesn't do much , but she has a presence about her that's unmistakable .

Yes , if this movie were just your average flick I would have ranked it low as the story , what little of it there was , just was not interesting . However , this movie is a lesbian adult film so with lots of sex so it gets a rather high score . This one also features quite a few cute girls in it , if only they got better sex scenes than a couple of the less attractive ones . The story , girl gets kicked out of her house or something , finds money and wants to do something or other with it . Heck , all I know is the plot might as well not been there at all it was so bland . The girls sex scenes more than makes up for this though , the lead being especially cute . You start with a scene with these two gals in a bathroom , their scene is rather long and they are rather cute just not up to some of the later ones who only got short sex scenes or ones with to many girls on screen at the same time . After that scene you get one with the cute lead , but she is with the least attractive woman in the flick so that scene goes on forever and while not bad I just would have preferred one of the other girls playing the realtor in that scene . Then you have scenes with to many women that it bombards the senses . They are good , I just rather see two girls at a time especially when they are as cute as the ones in these scenes . All in all though a very erotic adult film featuring all girls .

' As far as I'm concerned he never was ' replies Lockwood , a brilliant summation of Granger's talent , the lack of which , of course , failed to prevent him achieving film stardom . This Regency meller stands up remarkably well and if Mason and Lockwood are slightly over the top , Calvert a tad TOO twee , as if auditioning for any parts Olivia de Havilland might reject , and Granger too inept probably at the time - and wartime at that - they were all quite acceptable .

The problem with this movie is not the worms per se , which apparently go on the attack because a power line is down ( that happens all the time , and I have yet to see killer worms ) it is the thoroughly unlikeable characters . This is set in the south so everyone revs up the southern accent to intolerable levels ( I live here and I have yet to hear anyone sound that southern ) then there is Mic who is from New York . Why the heck is he in Georgia you ask ? He is antiquing . And they want you to believe he would be interested in the girl . Oh and don't get me started on the sheriff .

The king is dead , long live the king . With Billie Piper gone , ' The Runaway Bride ' needed to be good - fortunately , it was . Very good indeed . Beginning with secretary Donna Noble being spirited away from her wedding and dumped aboard the Tardis ( thereby removing the need for a lengthy reprise of Rose's tearful departure from ' Doomsday ' ) , the show was a tour de force of witty one-liners , great S .

I laughed out loud when the children in the car mouthed ' Jump ! ' . Before last Christmas , we wondered how David Tennant would shape up as the Doctor . Well , now we know - he is excellent . He handled with aplomb the humorous aspects of ' Bride ' , particularly his exchanges with Donna and later , the Empress of The Rachnoss . But his heartbreak at losing Rose had not dissipated - he saw her at the wedding reception . I hope his departure from the role is a long way off . I have to admit to not being a fan of Catherine Tate's T .

When Lance stuck the knife in , you were on her side . As for Sarah Parish as the Empress , what a performance ! That make-up job must have been hell ! Nice that we didn't see her actual death . A return appearance would be welcome . The plot may have been thin , but ' Bride ' pushed all the right buttons ; it had action , comedy , tragedy and , above all , spectacle .

Text2: There Must Be A Pillow Talking Rock For Doris , THERE MUST Pillow Talk was the first of three films Rock Hudson and Doris Day teamed on . Personally , I don't think it was their best , but it's entertaining enough . Though for the life of me I can't understand what Doris did in this particular comedy to warrant an Oscar nomination . Pillow Talk doesn't stand out in that way . Doris was passed over for such things as Love Me Or Leave Me , The Man Who Knew Too Much and Midnight Lace where she really did do some good acting . The premise is dated , party lines are certainly a thing of the past now with text messaging cell phones . I do recall back around the same time my grandparents still having a party line . In that sense Pillow Talk is dated . Still the film is funny enough . Virginal interior decorator Doris Day happens to get the same party line as wolfish songwriter Rock Hudson . Rock with his non-stop love life is constantly cutting in on Doris's business calls . When he accidentally learns who she is when at a bar she's fending off the advances of young Nick Adams , Rock embarks on an all out campaign to nail her as another trophy . Of course the imponderable of love always gets in the way in these films . Doris Day in all of her comedy films , be they with Rock Hudson or others always got a good group of supporting players . It seemed obligatory that Tony Randall before finding fame as Felix Unger , was always cast as the hero's best if goofy friend . It's either him or Gig Young in these roles . He creates his perennial character in Pillow Talk . On the female side Thelma Ritter as Doris's perpetually hung over maid is her deadpan best . My favorite scene in Pillow Talk is her drinking Rock Hudson under the table . Though audiences today might not get the whole party line premise , Pillow Talk is still funny enough for even the younger viewers .

962,"Text1: What the problem is ? I usually don't like Martin Lawrence and I find his anti-white humor to be quite offensive as well as his string of bad movies . But compared to his other movie of 2003 ( that would be the shockingly awful Bad Boys II ) , National Security is a rather easy-going and light-hearted cop comedy flick with quite a few good laughs . A lot of them , surprisingly , coming from Lawrence himself . Hank Rafferty ( Steve Zahn ) is a cop who is unfairly thrown in jail for apparently beating a black suspect ( Lawrence ) who just got kicked out of Police Academy . With his career in tatters he emerges from the slammer with only one job opportunity available ; a lowly guard for a lowly security company . Determined to follow up on the big case he was involved with before serving time , he crosses the path of fellow security guard Earl Montgomery ( Lawrence again ) and the two reignite their old conflict . The old love / hate buddy thing may be old and the plot may be silly but it's a great excuse for loads of action set-pieces and humor . The potentially dangerous comedy of black vs white never becomes offensive and is handled with such lightness that it never becomes an issue . Both men have their failings and bonuses and are as equal as each other . You really do feel a great partnership between them despite their arguing and fights . Give National Security a try . It's slick and fast-moving and is a helluva lot better than Bad Boys II . You'll probably be surprised at how funny Martin Lawrence is . I was . The DVD is in great looking 1 . 85 : 1 widescreen with pretty good Dolby 5 . 1 sound . The scenes where Lawrence uses his automatic pistol really pack a heavy punch in the . 1 LFE channel . The usual deleted scenes and commentary are included on the DVD but I was surprised the extended ending wasn't included in the film . It would have been better with it .


Text2: Why do people hate this film ? I honestly don't understand what all the fuss is about . Why do people hate Waterworld ? Why was it instantly disregarded before it was even released ? When you really think about it , how much different IS Waterworld from the more recent Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest ? They are quite similar if you think about it . Waterworld also cost $75 million less than DMC . But because it has Johnny Depp in mascara the whole world loves it ! Hypocrisy ! With a lot of behind the scenes trouble ( Reynolds walked off the film and Costner had to finish the final third of filming himself ) and negative pre-release buzz , everyone expected Waterworld to fail . Boasting a budget of ¬£175 million ( the most expensive ever until Titanic 2 years later ) it was sure to be a flop , especially with the snooty public and critics blasting it before its release . Then , the unthinkable happened . Upon release , Waterworld actually managed to prove critic expectation wrong and be a good movie , receiving good ( albeit ignored ) reviews and finally earning a grand total of $255 million at the Box Office . This is before video , laserdisc , TV , DVD and HD-DVD sales . Does sound like a flop to you ? The plot is far-fetched . Yes , but so is a plot involving fish-men , giant squids and Orlando Bloom as anything remotely masculine . But you accepted that quite easily . So just , for a minute , believe that if the polar ice caps DID melt that the world WOULD be covered in water . Set hundreds of years after this particular cataclysm , Waterworld follows the journey of The Mariner ( Kevin Costner , who is only referred to a few times but never actually named ) , a man who is one step beyond human as he has the ability to breathe underwater and has webbed feet . Early on in the movie , The Mariner comes across an Atoll , a floating small town complete with its own hill . . . er Waterbillies . When the Atoll is seized by crazed madman baddie boss Dennis Hopper as The Duke of the Deez ( as in Exxon Valdeez ) , The Mariner escapes with Enola , a little girl who may hold the secret of Dryland and her guardian Helen ( the totally gorgeous Jeanne Tripplehorn ) . Not happy with anyone leaving the party The Duke sends his army of filthy smokers to catch The Mariner and discover Dryland for himself . Waterworld has a lot going for it . It's everything an action / sci-fi movie should be . There is so much escapism in the stunning seascapes and tropical feel . James Newton Howard's exotic score ( replacing a rejected score by Mark Isham ) is breathtaking and I seriously recommend you hunt down the soundtrack CD . The action is almost entirely special effects and stunt-work and it's brilliantly done . The editing is also quite impressive as is the amazing sound design . Waterworld is far superior to many , more expensive action films but still carries this burden of negative , unfair public opinion . I have only ever seen the 136-minute cut of Waterworld that was released into cinemas and subsequent VHS etc . But a Director's Cut of 176 minutes has been shown on TV in America several times . This version apparently restores several scenes that tie up loose ends and answers a lot of questions about how the this particular watery future works as well as revealing that Dryland is actually Mount Everest . Other than TV airings , this version has never made available to the public . Which is quite annoying as there is a huge fanbase for it . Don't have prejudices against this movie . Think different and see for yourself how cool it is .

963,"Text1: SPIDER-MAN 3 ( Sam Raimi , 2007 ) I loved the first film ( which I watched twice in theaters ) but recall that the second installment was rather less enjoyable ; this seems to me to be slightly superior to its predecessor . Unfortunately , however , the action set-pieces are too dizzyingly-edited to be properly evaluated ; still , the high-rise stunt early on and the climactic battle of the mutants are undeniably spectacular . Besides , the complicated plot results in gross overlength - featuring yet another round of the Tobey Macguire / Kirsten Dunst / James Franco love triangle , too many adversaries for Spider-man ( with allegiances shifting frequently and unconvincingly ) , and a baffling insistence on the deaths of the Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson characters from the first film ! A platinum blonde Bryce Dallas Howard brings some much-needed freshness to the proceedings - though her role , ultimately , proves of little consequence . The Sandman's back-story is especially ludicrous and sentimental with an utterly wasted Theresa Russell as his resentful wife ; Venom , however , is interesting ( especially in the way he represents Spider-man's alter ego ) - but comes to the fore far too late into the game : his demise is nicely handled , too , but it's then ruined by the apparent necessity to eliminate the Topher Grace character . The scenes involving the ' Evil Peter Parker ' swagger , then , are eye-rollingly embarrassing , as is the musical number sung by Dunst during her disastrous Broadway stint ! The film allows Bruce Campbell yet another delightful cameo , and there's even a wonderful bit involving Spider-man co-creator Stan Lee . In the end , SPIDER-MAN 3 succeeds mainly as a slick and solidly entertaining ride ( as long as one doesn't analyze it too deeply ) .


Text2: SINS OF THE BORGIAS ( Christian-Jaque , 1953 ) This reasonably well-mounted and quite stylish historical saga features impeccable period detail but , unfortunately , fizzles out in the second half ‚Äì emerging to be rather uneven overall . Besides , it doesn‚Äôt rise to the full potential offered by its famous ( and much-filmed ) events ‚Äì especially given the fact that the character of Lucretia has been considerably whitewashed ! Still , the court intrigue is more interesting than the romance ‚Äì but the pageantry is rather splendid , and there‚Äôs plenty of exciting action throughout ( including a manhunt a ' la THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME [ 1932 ] ) . The casting , too , is exemplary : Martine Carol is an ideal Lucretia ( she went on to portray another famous ‚Äòcourtesan‚Äô in Max Ophuls‚Äô sublime LOLA MONTES [ 1955 ] ) ; a dashing Massimo Serato ; a rather subdued Pedro Armendariz as Cesare Borgia ; an impressively slinky Arnoldo Foa ' as Cesare‚Äôs resourceful lieutenant ; rugged Christian Marquand and an impossibly young Maurice Ronet as two of Lucretia‚Äôs ill-fated conquests ; a blink-and-you‚Äôll-miss-him Howard Vernon as a vicar ; Valentine Tessier as a wealthy eccentric ( she had been Madame Bovary in Jean Renoir‚Äôs 1933 version ) ; and Pieral , the psychoanalyst dwarf from Luis Bunuel‚Äôs THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE ( 1977 ) , who provides amusing but somewhat misplaced comic relief . For the record , the following are the other films I‚Äôve watched centering around this infamous noble family : Mitchell Leisen‚Äôs BRIDE OF VENGEANCE ( 1948 ) , Henry King‚Äôs PRINCE OF FOXES ( 1949 ; recently released on DVD ) ; and Sergio Corbucci‚Äôs much-inferior remake of THE MAN WHO LAUGHS ( 1966 ) .

The man is openly gay , and clearly attracted to Les . . . The final episode of ' Dawsons Weekly ' is a little belter ; the prospect of sex gives Les full opportunity to indulge in his penchant for gurning , which he employed when in his ' Cosmo Smallpiece ' persona . Interestingly , he never thinks to ask the name of the girl he intends to sleep with . Clearly no gentleman ! Edward Sinclair , who plays ' The Steward ' is , of course , immortalized in comedy history as ' The Verger ' from ' Dad's Army ' , while Kenny Lynch , a . k . a .

Though a ratings success , the show was savaged by the critics to such an extent Yorkshire Television decided not to recommission it ( critics had a lot more influence in those days ) .

Text2: Very slow and boring This film was slower than an elderly turtle . Never before have I seen a film that threatened to keel over and die so soon . It takes a healthy 45 minutes before George and Mark get to sea . And when they eventually do it's really not so spectacular . In fact it's slushier and sickeningly sentimental than it is exciting . Plus it's full of very , very bad dialogue . The dialogue is so poor me and my friends were in total hysterics . It was SO bad . The actual storm itself was quite tame to me . The only nauseating thing about it was the idiotically high volume . If a film is not exciting enough in it's basic story the soundtrack has to bombard us deafening noises . The characters made stupid illogical decisions and some don't even do much . The only thing about this film that surprised me was how much William Fichtner has built up his body since Go or Armageddon . Don't see this film for any reason .

966,"Text1: a minor work from Hitchcock ; however good it is sad that it was his last Family Plot is about a con-psychic , her cabbie boyfriend , another con-man / thief , and a diamond thief as his squeeze , who all come together unwittingly in a yarn surrounding a search for a son , a 10 grand reward , and some diamonds , plus lots of other small-time shenanigans . In any other hands this would be a very respectable , even near excellent feature ( or , as a TV movie , a big one for the mid 70s ) . And it is , on its own terms , a good , light thriller with a few laughs , some strong if two-dimensional characters , and solid dialog ( some of it , unlikely usually for the director improvised ) . But this director , of course , is Hitchcock , and after the flawed but monumental craftsmanship of Frenzy he falls onto material that is , frankly , not quite up to his level of sophistication and mastery of the medium Then again , maybe that's the way he wanted it , which is just as well . By this age of his mid-late 70s , he probably wanted to work on something that was only so much demanding , and could have some relaxing time while still having his total control over the production ( and at that age and after so long , he did earn the right to a few minor works , albeit after a slight slump in the late 60s ) . There's some good laughs to be had by way of Hitchcock's casting - Bruce Dern is always great , and Karen Black and William Devane and Barbara Harris put in their bits of effort too - and there's even a couple of near-brilliant scenes and flashes of the Master's style ; the cut-away from couple 1 ( Harris / Dern ) in the car following the start of the movie to the "" blonde "" Black walking across the road is a great little narrative leap . The climax , however ' old-hat ' it might be for some , is also sort of thrilling and with a final wink that says "" hey , it's all in high spirits .

Text2: Thoroughly enjoyable , memorable characters and scenes , an early classic in humanist / prison escape films I can't deny that Jean Renoir has a genuine eye for human connectedness and moves his camera with a practical naturalness . The performances by the principal actors as well ( Jean Gabin as the working-class Marechal , Pierre Fresnay as the eloquent Boieldieu , Marcel Dalio as the subtle and happy Rosenthal , and Erich von Stroheim as the un-mistakenly stiffest and suavest of movie prison wardens Captain von Rauffenstein ) are on the money every step of the way . Perhaps my one problem ( and it's not a big one ) with The Grand Illusion is that despite it being made at a time when cinema , in particular sound cinema , was just starting out , there could've been better targets hit by Renoir . He hits on a mark with these prisoners as well as with the guards - these are regular people , caught up and made to feel like they're in the schoolyard with ruthless heads and rebellious minions . As a satire , for some reason , it works a lot better for me than a drama - at least at first . For example , when Marechal is in solitary in the first prison , this is a masterpiece of a scene in and of itself , and for some reason I wanted more moments like this . While this could be attributable to the fact that Renoir didn't film everything he had intended with his script ( lack of budget one can assume ) , there are some expectations that weren't up to what could've been met . This may be variable from viewer to viewer , which is why this shouldn't deter those interested in seeing this - this is one of those POW films that's inspired others ( i . e . Great Escape ) , but has a sort of spirit that's all it's own . On the other hand in what comes out when one takes more of a look - which Renoir allows through how watchable ( in terms of just being able to not turn off the film once it starts ) the drama does become integrated with the critical view of the characters and changing situation . It's almost TOO complex , if that's possible . One of the fantastic joys of Grand Illusion is how much there is life and energy in his scenes depicting the prisons of world war one . Like in a Fellini drama ( which it may very well have inspired for the later Italian ) , there's a lot pf love for how cinema is made itself to get too depressed with the story & characters . And like in a neo-realist film , the dialog between the people is quite realistic and interesting . Some of the supporting characters / actions may seem odd to some new viewers , although one has to take into context the period . With an awesome cameraman ( Christian Matras ) , finite music score by Joseph Kosma , and an escape scene that's almost as thrilling as what Darabont cooked up in Shawshank , Grand Illusion is deservedly so the first film released by the Criterion collection ( DVDs ) , and is a suave , nice note in film history . AND , it definitely becomes better upon repeat viewings , as these characters become more familiar , as if we're in there in the prisons with these amicable , existential beings .

On the Statue of Libertry island security control center police commander Bob Haulk ( Lee Van Cleef ) takes off for Manhattan by helicopter to see if the president has survived .

Snake has to deal with vicious gangs , rough terrain and the ' Duke ' ( Isaac Hayes ) of New York who has plans for the president himself . Can Snake find and rescue the president in time ? Watch it and find out . Co-written and directed by John Carpenter this is a cracking piece of Sci-Fi entertainment . The script by Carpenter and Nick Castle moves along at a great pace and is never boring , the dialogue is good and as a whole the somewhat silly premise works very well . The special effects are also quite good and they certainly hold up pretty well even today . The cast is great , I really like Russell in this and he looks more or less perfect for the role of Snake Plissken with his long hair , thick stubble and eye-patch ! Experienced actors Cleef , Borgnine , Stanton , Hayes and Barbeau also all turn in fun performances . The appropriately cool sounding music by Carpenter and Alan Howarth reminds me of the score for Carpenter's Halloween ( 1978 ) a bit but that's no bad thing . It's generally well made overall and the widescreen cinematography by Dean Cundey and Jim Lucas does the job perfectly well .

Text2: Art Imitating Life ? ( There are Spoilers ) The movie "" Washington Story "" is about a straight as an arrow US Congressman Joseph T . Gresham , Van Johnson , who's career as a United States lawmaker is seriously jeopardized when he's accused of having been paid off by a big time ship builder and D . C lobbyist Philip Emery , Sidney Blackman , to vote for this bill that he's been pushing . At first Congressman Gresham is against the bill despite his voting base depending on it since it would have a major effect on the economy of his congressional district , ship building . This "" Ship Dispersel Bill "" would have all the ship building in Congressman Gresham district directed inland and thus take away thousands of jobs that are dependent on that industry . Gresham at the time is being followed around by news reporter Alice Kingley , Patricia Neal , who's doing a story on him for her newspaper . The truth is that Alice is really working for top D . C columnist and political muckraker Gilbert Nunnally , Philip Ober , who want's her to do a hit piece on the congressman and destroy his career for what he's got going against him ; a lawsuit for defamation of character on the part of Nunnally . We , as well as Alice , later learn that Congressman Gresham's change of heart in his vote for the bill had nothing to do with him getting paid off by Emery , like Nunnally wanted the public to believe . It's his concern for the national security of the United States even if that vote cost him his seat in the US Congress . There's also an important side story that really shows what a great person , as well as American , Congressman Gresham is with his selfless action to get Peter Kralik , Reinhold Schunzel , a man who lived in the USA for 28 years and is in danger of being deported his American citizenship . In the end Alice sees what a heel her boss Nunnally really is and quits working for him as a leg-women in getting the so-called dirt on Gresham and falls in love with the congressman where they then live happily ever after in D . C and his home back in Newchtester Ma . I was fascinated by the comparison between the person that Van Johnson played in the film Congressman Joeseph T . Gresham and the late and tragic President of the United States John F . Kennedy . Even though at the time that the movie "" Washington Story "" was made , in 1952 , JFK was a relatively unknown congressman from the state of Massachusetts . Both Congressman Greshman in the movie and Congressman Kennedy in real life were both democrats representing a congressional district in Massachustts and were elected right after WWII , 1946 , and served in the US Navy and decorated for bravery in that conflict . Even more fantastic is that Congressman Greshman met fell in love with and , obviously after the movie was over , married a woman who worked for a newspaper news reporter Alice Kingsley . At the time that the film "" Washington Story "" was being filmed John F . Kennedy met and later married Miss . Jacqueline Bouvier , the future Mrs .

968,"Text1: A Nutshell Review : Nancy Drew I last read a Nancy Drew book about 20 years ago , so much of my memory of the fictional character is probably faulty . From what I gathered , the books were introduced to me at an era when teenage sleuths were popular to children growing up at the time ( for my case , the 80s and early 90s ) , with Hardy Boys , Famous Five , and of course , "" Carolyn Keene "" ' s Nancy Drew amongst the more famous ones . I still remember those hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations , usually quite heavy ( for a kid ) to lug around , and the thickness of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large fonts . Well , the character has been given some updates along the way , as I recall my sister's subsequent Nancy Drew books becoming less thick , of softcover , with updated and a more chic Nancy illustrated on the cover . I can't remember if those stories were the same as the old hardcover ones , but I guess these books , being ghostwritten , have their fair share of updating itself for the times . In this Warner Brothers release of Nancy Drew , the character no doubt gets its update to suit the times , but somehow the writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen maintained her 50s - ish small town sensibilities , thereby retaining some charm and flavour that erm , folks like me , would appreciate . Her fashion sense , her prim and properness , even some quirky little behaviour traits that makes her , well , Nancy Drew . Her family background remains more or less the same , living with her single parent father Carson Drew ( Tate Donovan ) , who is moving his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity , and to wean his daughter off sleuthing in the town of River Heights . Mom is but a distant memory , and the housemaid makes a cameo . But what made Nancy Drew work , is the casting of Emma Roberts in the lead role . Niece of her famous aunt Julia , she too possess that sprightly demeanour , that unmistakable red hair and that megawatt smile . Her Nancy Drew , while in the beginning does seem to rub you the wrong way , actually will grow on you . And in almost what I thought could be a discarded scene from Pretty Woman , it had the characters walk into a classy shop with almost opposite reactions . While Dad Carson Drew tries hard to bring Nancy out of her sleuthing environment and to assimilate into normal teenage life , trust Nancy to find themselves living in a house whose owner , a Hollywood type has been , was found murdered under suspicious circumstances . Mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself an outcast of the local fraternity , and not before long we're whisked off along with her on her big screen adventure . There's nothing too Black Dahlia about the crime and mystery , and instead it's a pretty straightforward piece for Nancy to solve , in between befriending Corky ( Josh Flitter ) a chubby friend from school , and pacifying jealous boyfriend Ned ( Max Thieriot ) , while hiding the truth of her extra curriculum activities from her dad . The story's laced with cheesy fun and an oldie sentimentality which charms , and together , it becomes somewhat scooby-doo like . With minimal violence and no big bag gunfights or explosions , this is seriously a genre which is labelled clearly with "" chick flick "" alert . I guess the movie will generate a new generation of fans , rekindle the memories of old ones , and probably , just probably , might spark a new fashion trend of sporting penny loafers .


Text2: Polar Bears Cop turned director is a new one on me but there's always a first time I guess . One thing's sure Marchal has a lot of balls in titling his film as he has and so inviting direct comparison with the only other film to employ as its title the address of the Police headquarters in Paris , Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1947 classic called simply Quai des orfevres without the number which is superfluous . Clouzot's movie is well over 50 years old and featured a more sedate form of detection - Louis Jouvet was not exactly Monsieur Hard Man and , like the man said , the times they are a changing . Marchal , who began taking acting lessons when he was still a cop ( so that's how they perfect the good cop / bad cop routine ) and went on to play in several TV crime series , has based his story on a real situation , the internicine rivalry in the eighties between the BRI and the BRB , both working out of the Quai . Co-scriptwriter Dominique Loiseau was a player and this is partly his story . The film is dominated by two lions in winter , Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil recalling Duke Wayne and Bob Mitchum in El Dorado , two ageing pros if not yet over the hill certainly at the summit , so these two craggy bears , polar bears if you will , polar being the French name for gangster / caper / crime films , light up the screen no question about it as the respective heads of the BRB ( Brigade de Repression du Banditisme , that's Major Heists to you and me ) and BRI ( Brigade de Recherche et d'Intervention ( we're Gangbusters , Man ) . There's a history between these two , we're never QUITE told the full story which is a masterstroke , but it involves Vrink's ( Auteuil ) wife , who may have once been Klein's ( Depardieu ) girl . To sweeten the pot Mancini ( Andre Dussollier ) head honcho announces his retirement leaving his job up for grabs ; both are equally qualified but it's an open secret that the first guy to nail a particularly violent gang will become the new chief . Auteuil is our Dirty Harry kind of cop , often worse than the villains he's after but he DOES usually get them in the end , Depardieu is a tad choosier but not TOO good to live . To say more wouldn't really add much , I found myself a little intrigued by the long , black leather coats worn by both Brigades , resembling nothing so much as the outfit of choice of the Stasi in East Germany and I HOPE this is an oblique comment on the fact that ( England at least ) is slowly becoming a Police state . All in all an enjoyable romp and well worth 8 stars .

969,"Text1: all kinds of crossroads OK , you've probably heard that Bob Clark's ( RIP ) "" Black Christmas "" is basically the original slasher movie , the inspiration for John Carpenter's "" Halloween "" . Well , let me just say that - in response to the tag-line - my skin did actually crawl a little bit during some of the phone calls ! Of course , that doesn't even begin to identify what makes this such a scary movie . Aside from not knowing the killer's identity , some of the scenes towards the end really catch you . But that's only one cool aspect . The cast includes Olivia Hussey ( Juliet in "" Romeo and Juliet "" ) , Keir Dullea ( Dave in "" 2001 : A Space Odyssey "" ) , Margot Kidder ( Lois in "" Superman "" ) and John Saxon ( Roper in "" Enter the Dragon "" ) ; no doubt when Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea appeared in their most famous roles in 1968 , they never imagined that they would co-star in this sort of movie . Director Bob Clark is most famous for "" A Christmas Story "" and the "" Porky's "" movies ; seriously , what kind of person can lay claim to directing movies as different as these , plus "" Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things "" ? But the main point is that this is the mother of all slasher movies . Like "" The Jazz Singer "" to sound , like "" I Haven't Got a Hat "" to the Looney Tunes , like "" I Love Lucy "" to sitcoms , everything started here . No matter how you look at it , "" Black Christmas "" , for lack of a better word , is DA BOMB ! Not only do the cast members truly have something about which to proud , but it goes to show what we lost when Bob Clark got killed in a car wreck earlier this year . PS : the special edition DVD includes an interview with Olivia Hussey ( and she still looks quite good after all these years ) . She didn't see the completed film until many years later , as horror flicks scare her . Well , I think that it's practically a guarantee that at least one scene in this movie will scare you . Because as Olivia Hussey notes , the idea of there being something creepy out there is scarier than knowing what's there .


Text2: Wallace & Gromit : A Matter of Loaf and Death It had been 13 years since we had last seen the two lovable Plastercine characters in A Close Shave , and at Christmas we were entertained by this half hour adventure . Wallace ( Peter Sallis ) and Gromit are now earning a living turning 62 West Wallaby Street into a bakery , with a windmill , many mixing machines and ovens , and "" dough to door "" service . Recently 12 local bakers have been murdered , Gromit seems to be concerned , but Wallace isn't worried , he's too "" dough-eyed "" for local beauty and bread enthusiast , Piella Bakewell ( Coronation Street's Sally Lindsay ) . It is when Gromit discovers her dark plan , yes , she is the baker killer , that she is determined to do anything to stop him ruining her plan to kill Wallace . In the end it is the two dogs , Gromit and Piella's own poodle Fluffles ( Melissa Collier ) who save the day . A welcome return , and I'm sure this film will nominated for or win another Short Animated Film Oscar for creator Nick Park . Wallace and Gromit were number 11 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters , and they were number 15 on The 100 Greatest Kid's TV Shows , and as part of Aardman Animations , they was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons .

Text2: Tight thriller with a twist I do not know why people tend to rate this film low . Of course , I am slightly prejudiced as i always thought that Ray Liotta may be a cousin until I found out he was adopted . That doesn't take away the quality of his acting , especially in this film . He really has to lay it on thick as he takes the mind of others through an experimental drug developed by Dr . Martha Briggs ( Linda Fiorentino ) in an effort to find out who killed his wife ( Stellina Rusich ) . Fiorentino ( Dogma , Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back ) does a really good job as the research scientist who helps him through his ordeal . The film had other favorites : Kim Cattrall and Peter Coyote , who added to the mystery and suspense . I really like Liotta for his range and you could do a lot worse than spend two hours with him as he catches a killer .

Text2: An Audience With The Woodentops Would've Been More Fun When I heard about this , I thought it sounded interesting . How , I wondered , would they fit a street inside a small television studio to face an audience of D-listers ? Then I watched and realised my mistake . It was the cast of ' Coronation Street ' , not the street itself . Silly me ! With L . W . T . now part of Granada , I suppose a programme like this was inevitable . In terms of sheer inanity , it almost beat ' Russell Harty Meets Upstairs , Downstairs ' from way back in the ' 70's . Isn't it bad enough that we have to endure the ' Coronation Street ' gang doing whatever it is they get paid huge sums for ( it sure ain't called acting ) most week-nights , without this bilge being inflicted on us ? If I want bad singing , dancing , jokes etc . , I'll go to my local workingmen's club , not stay at home and watch the telly . At least there you get the privilege of heckling .

Its like watching a bizarre religious cult at work , preparing to hand over their cash and lay down their lives in a futile cause . ' Star Trek ' fans are often the butts of media sneers , yet soap opera addicts are regarded as nice , normal people indulging in a healthy obsession .

Considering it was rated R and didn't have anyone really big in it . . . the only person I recognize in the cast is Richard Moll . In the end though they didn't , which is too bad . This one is a good , bloody , fantasy film . The story isn't the best , but it has good action and sword fights , though the director really likes to show scenes where swords break like glass . As a kid I had trouble following the plot though as it was a bit hard to distinguish the good and bad guys , but later when I saw it , it was easier though I still say it could use a better plot .


Text2: I enjoyed it better than the original version , but really nothing new . Yes , this movie was a bit of a knock off of the ring , grudge and any other Japanese remake made in the past four or five years , still though I enjoyed it a bit . I thought it moved rather fast , and it was not boring for me so there you go . If I was a film critic I would lament the movie and curse its ever being made , but as just a dude who likes horror movies I liked it okay enough . This movie is a remake of a Japanese movie called "" Kairo "" , and I found this movie to be better than that one . It had better images and scary stuff . That movie was a bit overlong and did not really explain anything at all . However , this movie did explain to much . . . let me just say if you combine the two movies you would probably have a really good scary movie . This one is typical , everything is told to us and to be frank I hated the whole stealing the will to live thing . This was not in the original , but then this one only has some scenes that resemble each other and some of the plot is similar as well , but for the most part they are different . The movie has an eerie force coming through computers and other devices of a communication nature and coming after people . That is the extent of the film , nothing groundbreaking and certainly nothing original as the back of the box claims . I think it was wireless magazine that said it was the most original horror movie of the year , I am guessing this is the only one he has seen . This movie is more about ghosts coming to get you , while the Japanese version was more of a tale of loneliness and isolation that only gets touched on once here . So should you watch it . . . I don't know , if you are like me and give horror movies a break and enjoy them for what they are , an hour and a half cheesy diversion , then see it . If you tend not to like movies of this nature , basically "" The Ring "" and stuff skip it , you will not like it .

In 1999 , Morris becomes the "" Oldest Rookie "" when he lands a job with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as a 98 mph throwing lefty from the bullpen . Morris ' dream is short , but sweet . And his story seems to have spawned from a Hollywood script . Although this is based on fact the movie could have been much better if filmed with a more "" mature "" approach .

Text2: "" N'y sont pas . . . sont des Inuat . "" Before he became an action and thriller expert starting with "" Predator "" , director John McTiernan started out in film by giving us this intriguing , small-scale psychological thriller . After attaining stardom on TV thanks to ' Remington Steele ' , Pierce Brosnan here makes his starring film debut as Jean-Charles Pommier , a French anthropologist newly arrived in L . A . As the film opens , we see him crazed and bloody , attacking doctor Eileen Flax ( Lesley-Anne Down ) and somehow transferring to her his memories of the past week , as he was becoming obsessed with figuring out a strange group of drifters . As the film progresses , we see one offbeat , surreal encounter after another , and it is never made crystal clear ( although , in retrospect , I now think that this works in the films ' favor ) just how much in the film is "" real "" . How much of it is hallucination ? McTiernan is clever in the way that he's set all of this up . Brosnan immerses himself deeply in his role ; I can actually see the panic and frustration that the character feels . Down is also good in her role , succeeding in conveying her characters ' confusion and anguish . Supporting them are folks like film legend Nina Foch , Frances Bay , Alan Autry , the appealing Jeannie Elias ( 1981's "" The Pit "" ) , the gorgeous and luminous Anna-Maria Monticelli , pop star Adam Ant , and such cult actors as Mary Woronov ( who looks great and performs a sexy dance routine on top of a car ) and Frank Doubleday ( "" Assault on Precinct 13 "" , "" Escape from New York "" ) . The music by Bill Conti is one of his least typical . A pounding rock score with guitar performances by Ted Nugent , it's enjoyable , but doesn't really work all that well for this kind of film . I think that ultimately I would have preferred a more traditional , orchestral score , which tends to work better for scary and suspenseful stories . McTiernan maintains an appropriately sinister mood throughout , and delivers a fairly good thriller in the end result , not exactly like the majority of scary movies released in the 1980's . Recommended for those looking for something a little different .

Also , her relationship with a more successful partner , Phyllis , comes into play . Everything changed with the September 11th attacks , which , in a way , propelled Phoebe into insanity . Robin Wright Penn is a joy to watch in the movie . She never makes a false move ; Ms . Wright Penn is an intelligent actress who gets under the skin of any of her screen characters .

Text2: A & C return to that other popular entertainment medium of the 1940s We think of Abbott and Costello as burlesque comics , but the medium that gave them the national exposure allowing them to go into film was radio . It was on radio that the sharpness of such routines as "" Who's On First "" was demonstrated to millions , laying the groundwork for the film audience that Universal benefited by . And it was WHO DONE IT ? that was their film about radio . They are soda jerks in a restaurant in the building that a radio station is headquartered in . They both want to break into radio . But when they are finally on the premises of the station , they are among the witnesses ( and suspects ) at the murder of the station's owner ( Thomas Gomez ) . Due to Costello's continuous ability to make errors , they are suspected of the murder by the two detectives ( William Gargan and William Bendix ) who are assigned to the case . They are determined to try to solve the case and clear themselves . Gargan and Bendix were ideal foils for A & C , especially Bendix who meets Costello's dumb with dumber . The nadir for both cops is when they are guarding the front of the office building from Abbott and Costello entering it while the investigation is continuing . Bud and Lou , determined to enter the building , walk in backwards , so the cops think they are seeing them walk out ( at least momentarily ) . Rumor has it that Costello determined never to make another film with Bendix - he was jealous of the latter's getting more laughs than him . It may be true , but then Lou was doing pretty well on his own here . As it is a war picture , the mystery also deals with a spy ring . The actual perpetrator is a surprise of sorts at the end . A good comedy , I give it .

976,"Text1: if only the script were halfway as captivating as the animation / music I remember seeing American Pop years ago , but not remembering much from it aside from its ' different ' kind of animation ( which I now know is rotoscoping where characters move life-like to the point where it's basically plopped onto the real people's action ) and music . The music , actually , more than the animation in a way . I remembered a few of the songs too , like "" Somebody to Love "" and "" Night Moves "" . Watching it now the animation pulls together with more of the historical concepts , but there's a problem with the film that I couldn't quite shake . Despite the really interesting and could-be-really-something kind of idea of charting one line of generation after generation in 20th century America through their disjointed lives and their connections to music , the script is weak . I'm not expecting it to be 100 % realistic - the animation of course in Baski's style makes things that much more abstracted - but in most scenes a ' point ' has to be made , and only very , very broad strokes are made with the characters . Only early in the film when the boy is passing out the fliers in the club , and with some of the scenes with Frankie , are there some convincing moments with character and dialog . But , then again , most who watch the film aren't looking for an amazing story , as the progression of one generation to the next is really just a bridge to the musical side of the film . This , on the other hand , is quite good , if understandably abbreviated for everything in American popular music ( i . e . blues isn't nearly given as much time as Jazz is ) . The early music in the film is typical , but quite amazing in how it then relays off of the images , later becoming all immersed in the counterculture times of the 50s , 60s and 70s . And the rotoscoping used here , while not of the highest quality , is at least trying to do something different with the medium , and on the visual side Bakshi does pull it off . Some sequences look rather complex ( world war 2 scenes come to mind , also the more psychedelic scenes ) , even as it all does border on becoming tedious . The combination of music and film does create some memorable , if dated , material to view on and see years from now . But it does miss the mark of its ambitions by not giving more thought into the script , as it does have a concept ( using music to chart the discord in a family born from immigrants ) that is great and could be used better in other films .


Text2: If not a great movie , it is a good one , stirring up questions of Good vs . Evil Of the filmmaker Werner Herzog , I've heard and read strange things about him and his films . That two of his works , Aguirre : The Wrath of God , and Fitzceraldo , are two of the most bizarre modern European films . That he once ate a shoe from a bet with Errol Morris , and made a documentary about it . That he once said ( and I'm paraphrasing ) "" some people make movies with their minds and hearts , I make them with my ( expletive ) . "" So , when I saw this film at the rental store , Invincible , and the image of Tim Roth in a truly Gothic pose on the cover , I expected it to be a dark , brooding film about pre-war , pre-dictator Hitler Germany . In a way it is , and in a way its not . Although the film is rated PG-13 , I would imagine that for the die-hard Herzog fans this is like his family film , or at the least kids might not be too freaked out to watch it . Surprisingly , Herzog brings a fable out of a true story , about how each side of the coin is a certain way , black or white , and whichever role you choose defines you , though there can be an exception . There was one sequence , however , where I saw that Herzog brilliantly had a kind of surreal , one-of-a-kind filmed scene that I expected amongst the more typical dramatic scenes . It involves a dream of Zishe's ( played by near unknown Jouko Ahola in a mostly one-note performance ) where he walks around on a rocky beach . He is surrounded by bright red crabs , and steps around on the rock trying not to knock them down or get snipped by their claws . But he does so casually , with the searing Hans Zimmer / Klaus Blaudet music in the background . This dream occurs again towards the end of the film , as his younger brother leads him by the hand through the crabs on the rocks , somehow giving him strength . These are powerful scenes in a movie that could've been even more powerful . Take Tim Roth's performance - it towers above all the others because most ( aside from Udo Kier whom I recognized ) are non-professionals . It's to Herzog's credit that he makes these people in Poland shtetels and in Berlin to be believable , but he's not a great director of them like the neo-realists in Italy were . And because Roth , as this brooding , tragic anti-hero witnesses what happens with his strongman from Poland , is so good and subtle at his role , he out-acts pretty much anyone else in the film . Watching him is fascinating , especially when he's quiet and subtle , or in the scenes when he's on stage performing his acts . It shows how versatile he can be in this film . I just wish it was the same for the others . ( strong )

Thalmus Rasulala is an actor who has always impressed me and he does nothing to change my opinion in Bucktown . Carl Weathers and Tony King also give nice performances .

I don't care if they were good-for-nothing racists , someone ( State officials , family members , concerned citizens , , etc . ) would surely take notice and come to town to do something about it .

980,"Text1: Solid , if unremarkable , murder mystery Not a movie that will go down in history , but if you're looking for something to keep you interested for 90 minutes , you could do a lot worse than watching "" Murder at the Presidio "" . It's a murder mystery set at a military base , and even though the script ( based on a true story ) gets too soap-opera-ish at times , the handling is solid in a somewhat old-fashioned way . Lou Diamond Phillips portrays the determination of his character to get to the truth convincingly ( when someone asks him "" You'll find the murderers , right ? "" and he responds "" Yes . I will "" , you believe him ) , and Victoria Pratt is fit , sweet , sexy and beautiful - very close to my perception of the ideal woman ( she may be somewhat miscast though - she looks too strong for what happens to her character at one point ) . The rest of the actors are mostly unknown , but they do the job . As does , in general , the film . Other reviewers have mentioned inaccuracies in the depiction of military life , but the majority of viewers will neither notice them , nor care . ( )


Text2: Mr . Crosby Steals Film From Miss Davies When she discovers that the crooner she adores is GOING HOLLYWOOD , a liberated school teacher dogs his steps all the way to the Studio sound stages . Marion Davies tries her hardest to entertain in this tinsel town spoof , but neither the script ( based on a story by the celebrated Frances Marion ) nor the direction give her much leeway . Raoul Walsh seems a curious choice to direct this kind of film , but he must have had William Randolph Hearst's approval or he never would have been given the assignment . The trouble is that Marion has little chance to be anything other than sweet & pleasant - when finally given the opportunity to do a wicked spoof of co-star Fifi D'Orsay , she's terrific . Unfortunately , moments like that come all too rarely . Leading man Bing Crosby comes off rather better , showing the casual charm that would make him a huge star . And he gets to sing some fine tunes by Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed , including the classic ? Temptation ' and the fun ? We'll Make Hay While The Sun Shines . ' Although his character is a bit of a cad , Bing never fails to deliver the goods to the audience . A troika of character performers add sparkle to the proceedings : earnest Stuart Erwin as a film producer ; caustic Ned Sparks as a dictatorial director ; and tomboy Patsy Kelly as a plain-talking gal trying to break into the movies . Movie mavens will spot Clara Blandick & Nora Cecil as two of the ossified instructors at the girls ' school , and Sterling Holloway as a recording mike technician - all uncredited . Oddly , this film about the Hollywood movie business takes time out to poke fun at contemporary radio stars . Mimic singers & impressionists , The Radio Rogues will provide a smile to viewers with very long memories . Time has not dealt kindly with Marion Davies . Almost forgotten today , when remembered at all it is usually as a sort of footnote to history or object of scandal . Her life certainly was colorful , and as chatelaine of America's most amazing private estate she did circulate amidst powerful circles . But to remember her as only the bimbo blonde mistress of the country's mightiest media baron is patently unfair . While much of the blame can go to Orson Welles ' spoof of Davies in CITIZEN KANE ( which he was to admit he regretted towards the end of his life ) it must be stated emphatically that Marion was not a no-talent actress with few friends & even fewer brains , whose career was destroyed by her stammer , leaving her to spend lonely years in great , hulking empty castles . In reality , Davies was a bright , vivacious lady who charmed & captivated such diverse guests as George Bernard Shaw & Winston Churchill throughout her 33-year liaison with Hearst . Adored by her friends and a fierce cadre of fans , Davies was renowned for her tireless generosity and charitable good works . Her speech impediment never affected her screen acting and her undeniable talent was evident to any who were willing to assess her performances honesty and look past the scandal . Davies had to have been embarrassed by the Hearst empire's relentless pushing of her career . She knew this left her open to ridicule & mockery , doubtless contributing to her scarcely concealed alcoholism . But she eventually relinquished her film pursuits in order to care for the aging Hearst , and after his death in 1951 she showed herself to be an astute businesswoman during the remaining ten years of her life . It is only now , with the passage of much time & the restoration of her old movies , that it is becoming easier to acknowledge the contributions & cinematic expertise of Miss Marion Davies .

As Loftus , Upton and Collier attempt to put him back together , they endeavour to conceal from Loftus that Pippa is in the operating theatre , dressed as a nurse . . . Easily the least successful aspect of the first season of ' Doctor In The House ' was Martin Shaw's performance as ' Huw Evans ' . He just did not seem to work as well as the others . I do not know whether it is down to John Cleese's script , or whether Shaw had grown in stature as an actor since 1969 , but I was surprised to find myself warming to Huw here .

Noel thought that because ' Tiswas ' featured people getting soaked to the skin , and sprayed with green slime , it was a bad show . Then , twenty years later , he gave us ' Noel's House Party ' . Go figure . According to a ' Radio Times ' article , Noel ' likes a cup of coffee and a cartoon at eleven o'clock ' . He may still do for all we know . Being a live show , anything could happen . One of the classic moments was when Noel interviewed Debbie Harry of ' Blondie ' fame . He asked Ms . Harry to pick the winner of the previous week's competition , and she'd agreed . Eric's bubble descended onto the set . That week , it was made up to resemble Jimmy Savile O . B . E . Fearing Debbie might mistake the face for an unkind caricature of herself , Noel quickly pointed out it was in fact Jimmy Saville , of whom she'd never heard - his discomfiture was delicious . The Roving Swapman , Cheggers , provided another Solid Gold moment when a trophy he presented to a figure skater fell to pieces in his hands ! I often wondered what the parents of all those children wanting to swap their toys on air thought of this show . I bet that some were still being paid for on hire purchase . Hobbyists were also a regular item ; one horrible boy bragged about his fabulous collection of Marvel Comics . I felt like phoning in to do a ' Five Star ' on him ! The best thing about ' Swap ' was that it kept Noel off peak-time telly for years . Then , one day , it tragically ended , leaving Noel free to whirl his wheels and hand out gotchas !

982,"Text1: Parts of a Man SPOILERS What the movie "" Resurrection "" shows is that religious nuts , from all dominations and cultures , are about as dedicated to their religious beliefs as those who try to suppress and eradicate them . This deranged psycho is out on the streets of Chicago trying to replicated Jesus ' Easter suffering by using unsuspecting persons , whom he kidnaps and brutally murders , body parts in his recreating Jesus ' ordeal on the Cross . This wacko goes so far as seeking out his victim in that they have the same biblical names that connects them , in the Bible , with Jesus ' Apostles ! He also makes sure that his victims are also the same age that Jesus was when he was crucified : 33 years old ! It's transplanted , from New Orleans , Cajun Chicago police detective John Prudhomme , Christopher Lambert , who gets the jump on the killer by deciphering his notes , that he carved into his victims bodies , he left at his crime scenes . Det . Prudhomme's attempt to catch the elusive killer leads to his partner Det . Hollinsworth , Leland Orsen , ending up not only getting shot by the police , in mistaking him for the killer , but having his left leg cut off , by the killer , when he's left alone and under intensive care in his hospital room ! As things turn out it takes FBI profiler Agent Wingate , Robert Joy , to get Det . Prudhomme as well as the Chicago PD to finally get it straight in not just why this psycho is committing these ghastly crimes but who he really is ! This revelation , on Agent Wingate's part , is by far the most shocking and surprising sequence in the movie . What really makes the movie "" Ressurection "" go completely downhill is that after the killer's identity is revealed he walks right into a trap , that with his great intelligence and intuition he should have seen coming , that Det . Prudhomme and the Chicago PD set for him . With the killer being so smart as well as omnipresent during the first 75 minutes of the movie he then , after he's discovered , does everything in not at all bothering to prove his innocence that he easily can , by his manipulating the law and the courts , but goes out of his way in his death wish-like effort to prove his guilt instead ! This has him going on a mindless and murderous rampage knocking off some dozen people by the time the movies over ! Most , if not all , of those that he murders have nothing at all to do with his sick scheme in replicating the Miracle of Easter ! You have to have a really strong stomach to be able to sit through this movie that tries to outdo the film "" Se7en "" which has an almost identical storyline . "" Ressurection "" goes to show how unchecked religion , or religious fanaticism , can effect a disturbed and unstable mind who uses it for his own sick and maniacal purpose's . In the case of the movie "" Ressurection "" the sick person who's mind is effected uses religion , like the psycho in Se7en , to mask his dark and deep psychotic and murderous fantasies by having it justify not , what in reality it would do , condemn them !

983,"Text1: A Nutshell Review : Night at the Museum Night of the Museum is this year's Chicken Little . With the trailer played almost every time before a movie is screened , it's arguable that this is probably the most watched movie trailer for the year , with that T-Rex skeleton taking a sip from the water cooler , made the iconic scene for the film , taking over Chicken Little doing its rendition of "" the running man "" . Given its marketing muscle , it'll work two ways - live up to its hype , or gets buried in it when it fails to deliver , given its continuous build up of expectations . Night at the Museum treaded dangerously close to the latter . Fans of Ben Stiller , myself included , will definitely not miss this movie . There's this tinge of zaniness in his movies and characters , and most of his comedic films never fail to crack me up . I reckon at least one scene in every movie will have me ended up in stitches with tears rolling . Sadly , this was not to be for Night at the Museum . It's a pretty ordinary role about a very ordinary quitter , who can't seem to hold down a regular job , and is faced with losing respect from his son , now living with his estranged wife . So as the story goes , he gets a job as the sole night watchman of the Museum of Natural History , and as you would already know , it's a kids fantasy as inanimate objects and statues all come to life when the sun goes down . At its heart , this is a children's movie , through and through , having caricatures for villains , and situations which are deemed very family friendly , which suits its target audience to a T . It's filled with top notch special effects and costumes to bring history to life , but again it's nothing groundbreaking about it . The storyline is rather plain and almost buried itself under ultra predictable plot lines , which is a pity because it had some great supporting cast , like Robin Williams , who was surprisingly very muted and restrained , Dick Van Dyke , Mickey Rooney , Ricky Gervais , Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan , the latter two playing combative , bickering figures from different eras who are in constant battle for more territory . To thoroughly enjoy this , bring along a kid , or allow the kid inside you some leeway to take over your emotions for a while . Otherwise , this movie will be a tad tough to sit through without constantly checking your watch . Hope the next Ben Stiller project will be much better .


Text2: A Nutshell Review : The Paper I've been to a newsroom only twice in my life . First , it's to collect some lucky draw winnings , and I had a sneak peek into the hustle and bustle of a newsroom from behind a glass panel . The next one was more up close and personal , because a journalist friend brought me right up to his desk ( and an incredibly piled up one at that ) , and I had first hand view of how news got made . Or at least it seemed that the next day's articles were done up because there were few people left in the office , and there was a group huddled at one corner . Ron Howard's The Paper was one of those films that I didn't catch at the cinemas ( at that time , the teenage me only recognized Michael Keaton of his 1989 Batman and 1992 Batman Returns fame ) , and missed a number of scheduled telecast and re-runs on television . So it's no surprise that I snapped up the DVD the minute I saw it in the discount bins at the store . And I wonder just why the heck it took me so long to get down to watching this , with no regrets ( save for the technical aspect of the presentation ) . Keaton plays a Henry Hackett , a sub-editor for a small time tabloid in New York . Being a go-getting workaholic , he often puts his family life aside , which of course puts his very pregnant wife Martha ( Marisa Tomei ) under a lot of stress especially with her pregnancies woes , and not being able to get out there and do stuff . For their financial stability , one of the many subplots here involves her getting Henry a job interview at a larger paper , The Sentinel , and threatens him not to sabotage his own opportunities for advancement , which we learnt that he does so quite frequently in order to stay where he is . And it's not rocket science why too , as the bunch of folks he's working with is really madcap , and I think I too can thrive in such as a stressful , chaotic , but totally livewire environment . Each character presents a separate subplot which intertwines with Henry's life , and in one scene which I was totally mesmerized with , was when everyone dropped by Henry's office , and it went just off the hook . Wonderful stuff there , especially when you have Glenn Close as a rival sub-editor who happens to be the office bicycle ( erm , that means everyone had had a ride ) , Robert Duvall as an ailing editor stricken with cancer and trying to reconcile with his estranged daughter , and Randy Quaid in a totally hilarious role as the bummer in the office . All these while the team had to debate with the front page story for the next day , centered on reporting what's accurate and doing what's right ? the social responsibility in being a paper , with pressure on them because they had missed the previous day's scoop . Everyone's preoccupied with their own personal agenda , set against an office where the air-conditioner isn't working and driving temperatures and tempers up . It's work and family over a period of 24 hours , and I felt that this film had a story that ranks itself up there with other films that deal with their narratives over the same time period . You'd have come to expect a certain assured standard from director Ron Howard , and this film demonstrates nothing less . Everything naturally comes together perfectly toward the end like the birth of a new dawn , with relationships bruised but not battered , and what I also enjoyed here was John Seale's superb cinematography which had this extremely fluid motion when bringing us in and around a newsroom for that office tour each time we run around like crazy with Henry . The paper would be one of my personal favourites , and my only regret ( besides the technical aspects of the DVD ) was why it had taken me this long to uncover this gem of an enjoyable film .

984,"Text1: Critics were right : it stinks , big time ! The critical reaction to this film was just vile , but then a lot of normal people who saw it afterward said , "" Nah , it's pretty good . "" I'm here to tell you that the initial critical reception was right on the money for this one . It's God-awful . A symbologist and a cryptologist ( two fields of study which probably do exist , I suppose , but sound awfully made-up ) get framed for murder and get caught up in an ages-old clash between factions of the Catholic church . The movie mostly consists of the two scholars ( Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou ) racing from one locale to another solving riddles and puzzles , and just barely escaping the cops and the villains each time . The puzzles are reminiscent of the ones the Riddler produced on the 1960s Batman show : they're completely inane ; no one could ever solve them , certainly not the audience . But somehow the heroes figure it all out in a matter of seconds . It's about as much fun as watching someone do a Sudoku when you don't know the rules . And the characters are as paper-thin as they could possibly be . I had absolutely zero involvement with them or their adventure . Dan Brown's novel is famously terrible , and , while I've often heard cinema improves his painful prose , after watching this film I shiver to think what actually reading him feels like . If the plot weren't enough to convince me , the dialogue is terrible . The actors are all only here for the fat paycheck . Hanks in particular seems completely dissatisfied with the part . Possibly the worst movie of the year .


Text2: Good Quincy murder mystery . Quincy M . E . : Valleyview starts as Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is asked to perform a private autopsy on seventy six year old Howard Phillips by his Grandson David ( Ed Begley Jr . ) , the official cause of death is a heart attack but David is sure that was not the case & that the Doctor's at Valleyview Sanitarium are hiding something . After the autopsy Quincy is puzzled , he has no idea how Howard died & it certainly wasn't from a heart attack although Quincy discovers Howard was suffering from prostate cancer . Then another body , that of mentally retarded teenager Anne , is brought in on a tip-off & again Quincy can find no cause of death . Quincy then thinks that there may be a mercy killer at Valleyview murdering terminally ill patients but no-one will believe him & without any evidence he has nowhere to go . . . Episode 12 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Ronald Satlof & is a very entertaining murder mystery with which to pass fifty odd minutes . Here the sensitive & emotive issue of euthanasia & mercy killing is brought up but while in later seasons of Quincy this issue would have been explored much deeper , dominated proceedings & been the moral issue of the week here in Valleyview it is merely used as a backdrop & motive for multiple murder that Quincy has to use his medical knowledge & skills to solve & as such doesn't go to much into the moral & social issues , implications & arguments surrounding the delicate topic which is fine with me since I much prefer the murder mystery themed Quincy episodes than the overly heavy handed moralistic ones . Valleyview is solid throughout , there's a steady stream of murder victims , there's a strong mystery element , the final outcome isn't too obvious & will probably keep you guessing until the end , there's the scenes where Quincy comes up against & fights bureaucracy , there's the scenes where no-one will believe Quincy & his ideas & there's that trademark Quincy humour . Pretty much all any Quincy fan would want from an episode really . There's nothing that is particularly memorable in this episode , it's well made but somewhat flat & a bit bland . Have you ever noticed the production team use the same still shot of Quincy's car parked outside Danny's ? I'm sure it's just a single stock photograph that they use as a quick establishing shot to show that Quincy is at Danny's in the same way all the exterior shot's of Quincy's building look exactly the same ! The acting is alright here so there's no problems on that front , TV & Hollywood veteran Ed Begley Jr . makes his first of three Quincy guest appearances & would next feature in the excellent No Way to Treat a Body ( 1978 ) during season four while Carolyn Jones made this the same year she starred in Tobe Hooper's one time ' video nasty ' here in the UK the sleazy killer man eating Crocodile flick Eaten Alive ( 1977 ) . Valleyview is a good solid early Quincy murder mystery that has a hint of a moral message but thankfully doesn't let it overshadow or dominate the mystery crime elements .

Text2: How Kolchak Inspired Carter When originally screened in America in 1972 , ' The Night Stalker ' became the highest rated made-for-T . V . movie in history . Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel , it told how a fearless investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak ( the late Darren McGavin ) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern-day Las Vegas . When it arrived on British television four years later , it did not quite have the same impact , but my friends were talking about it at school on Monday morning , as indeed was I . We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen . I did not know of the existence of ' The Night Strangler ' until it turned up nearly a decade later . I . T . V . , who screened the ' Kolchak ' movies , had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series ; they felt ' Barnaby Jones ' starring Buddy Ebsen to be more of a draw , and anyway , viewers might confuse ' Kolchak ' with ' Kojak ' ! For years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in Fangoria magazine . I could not even purchase the Jeff Rice novels . Then something wonderful happened . In 1990 , B . B . C . - 2 put out the show as part of a late-night Friday series devoted to the supernatural called ' Mystery Train ' , hosted by Richard O'Brian . ' Kolchak ' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of ' The Brain Eaters ' and ' Earth Vs . The Spider ' . The opening titles were trimmed , removing Kolchak's whistling , and the closing credits . . . well , there were none . The first episode screened was ' Werewolf ' . I cannot say I was overly impressed , but stuck with it , and am I glad that I did ! I really wish I'd seen it in 1974 . My twelve year old self would have adored it . Creepy , humorous , exciting , no wonder it fired Chris Carter's imagination . The show's biggest asset was , of course , McGavin . Unlike the recent Kolchak , the original was an everyman figure , eccentrically dressed , rather conservative . He was to the supernatural what ' Columbo ' was to crime . The late Simon Oakland was great too as Kolchak's bad-tempered boss Tony Vincenzo . The scripts overflowed with wonderful , dry wit . I found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror . When the twenty episodes ended , I felt bereft . ' The X-Files ' came along a few years later and filled the void - but only to an extent . I wanted Kolchak and Vincenzo back . I am glad that the show was never revived though . Without Oakland it would not have been the same . I have the Rice books now and have read them several times . I was very surprised when Stephen King slated the first ( in his book ' Danse Macabre ' ) as it is as good as anything he has written . Alright , so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art , but so what ? The new ' Kolchak ' totally missed the point of the original . What you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do . . . Best Episode - ' Horror In The Heights ' Worst Episode - ' The Sentry '

Whoever strays into the house when Freudstein is on the hunt is brutally butchered . Why ? Because doctor Freudstein needs human blood to survive . Great atmosphere , lots of graphic gore and marvelous soundtrack by Walter Rizzati . The ending is very intense and creepy as hell . Almost everyone complains about Giovanni Frezza , but he plays a terrified child very well . The special effects by bloody maestro Gianetto De Rossi and his brother Gino are simply top-notch . The scenes of gory mayhem include a knife through a girl's skull , a babysitter who gets her neck slashed many times then decapitated , the maggots inside of Freudstein's rotting corpse , very nasty flesh ripping etc . There is also a truly nerve-wracking moment when Freudstein pushes a young boy's head up against a door while Paolo Malco ( "" The New York Ripper "" ) attempts to chop it down with an axe . Some people don't appreciate this film and call it trash , but they're not a real horror fans . They love probably a new mainstream crap like "" Scream "" or "" The Mummy "" . So if you are a part of mainstream society don't rent this one , better watch again "" The Mummy "" or similar MTV-influenced garbage .

Text2: Very pulpy . . . perhaps too pulpy for my tastes I'm not sure what would have made this film more appealing to me . . . maybe Tarantino should have directed it . . . maybe someone other than Christian Slater should have played the lead role . . . maybe there should have been fewer deaths . . . maybe the film should have been shorter . As is , the film just didn't interest me all that much , and I only really paid attention to the first few and the last few scenes . The plot never really got my interest , though I thought the love story between the two leads was surprisingly good . The pacing seems much too slow and jolted for a Tarantino film ( honestly , either Tarantino should have been allowed to direct it or Scott should have written his own script ) . The acting ranges , but most of it is good . Slater is acceptable , but a good actor he is not . His performance is passable at best , and him being the leading man definitely took a lot out of the experience for me . The film never really seemed to take off or go anywhere . . . and not long into the movie , it was just waiting for the next guy to get killed . The dialog is typical Tarantino , meaning somewhat roundabout , but usually funny and / or insightful . The humor is pretty good , and also fairly typical Tarantino ( though it too would have benefited from Tarantino directing the film ) . To make it perfectly clear ; the film is clearly and obviously and in many , many ways a Tarantino film . His unique and easily recognizable style is here , just like in Reservoir Dogs , both volumes of Kill Bill , Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown . However , this is , by definition , not a Tarantino film . He didn't direct it , and believe me , it shows . Scott just doesn't "" get "" Tarantino's style , and messes up so many of his trademarks ( most notably , he removes the important non-linear time-line ) and references , stuff that Tarantino never would have blown , not in a million years ( here I feel it is necessary to point out that I am not a fan of Tarantino's ) . Yes , that's what really brings this film down ; another director trying to shoot a story that Tarantino has put together , and who completely misses the boat . Just for the record , an example of a director's perfect use of a Tarantino script is the Robert Rodriguez / Quentin Tarantino collaboration From Dusk Till Dawn . Go see that one before even thinking about this one . I recommend this film to Tarantino / pulp fans . Give it a chance . Just don't expect a Tarantino film .

If the murky photography shown in this short subject with clips from AROUND THE WORLD UNDER THE SEA ( ' 66 ) is any indication , the bad comments from others on the feature length version of the film are more than vindicated . In fact , the color photography is murky whether photographed above or below water and the narration is weak . We get a glimpse of an underwater world from a picture-making expedition that had men scouting locations from the Bahamas to Australia . I'm sure they had a more interesting time than these film clips reveal . A few brief shots of LLOYD BRIDGES , SHIRLEY EATON , KEENAN WYNN and BRIAN KELLY are all we get of the actors involved , while most of the time is spent telling us how dangerous the expedition was for combat divers and their underwater equipment , with camera crews swimming among dolphins , barracuda and even sharks .

Text2: Keaton is in top form I just wrote a review for STEAMBOAT BILL , JR . and that makes this review VERY difficult , because I really can't decide which of these two films is better . To me , they are both nearly perfect and represent the best full-length material Keaton performed - - at least when it comes to stunts and laughs . It's sad really , as just after these two triumphs came the sound era - - and a seriously negative down-turn in Keaton's career , as MGM repeatedly gave him terrible material - - pairing him with the brash and inappropriate humor of Jimmy Durante . This film is probably the best of his films when it comes to concept and consistency of the humor and plot . It really never lags and is both exciting and funny throughout . And , for once , I have nothing critical to say about the film . No matter how many times I see it , it just seems perfect . This might just be my favorite silent comedy - - period . It's that good . By the way , while all is practically perfect in every way about this film , this is NOT my favorite Keaton full-length film . While not as funny or filled with amazing stunts , OUR HOSPITALITY is an amazing film for its artistry . In addition to being the prettiest of his films , it also features among the best characterization for Keaton - - with a full and rich plot . My advice is to see THE GENERAL and OUR HOSPITALITY and see two very different and probably equally great films from a master .

989,"Text1: Revenge is a dish best served cold , messy , fast , loud , and at great length . Having been hugely impressed with House of 1000 Corpses , I was eager to see Rob Zombie's next directorial effort , but found that it fell short in a lot of areas . Midway through the film , for example , it roughly turns into an almost senseless mishmash of Texas Chainsaw elements , losing sight of the return to true horror that Zombie presented in his last film . I think that as I get older I have lost a lot of my taste for some of the things you see in horror movies , although it remains one of my favorite genres . I remember when I was in high school I thought the Faces of Death movies were the coolest things imaginable , and that anyone who could get their hands on the elusive Faces of Death part 1 achieved an almost God-like status , as did the first person who discovered the Traces of Death films , which were supposed to be even better . Today , you would have to put a gun to my head to get me to watch even a single scene out of any one of those movies . The horror genre as a whole , however , remains a lot of fun to me , because the movies are generally more fun than disturbing . But I think that when a movie or series of movies becomes sort of a contest to see who can come up with the sickest , most torturous and disturbing things that they can possibly put on screen , then the whole point is missed . I don't know , maybe I've just moved to a different wavelength . At any rate , The Devil's Rejects are your standard Texas Chainsaw family that lives on a farm covered with dozens and dozens of the mutilated bodies of missing persons from the area , and William Forsythe plays the detective with a special link to the case , who ultimately decides to take matters into his own hands when he finds the restrictions of police procedure to be too much to bear . I am reminded at times of the horrendously sick and disappointing Wolf Creek , but I will leave it at that . I have far too much respect for Rob Zombie as both a musician and a filmmaker to tie even any part of his film to such pure , authentic waste as the recently released Hostel from Eli Roth , easily one of the five worst films I have ever seen in my entire life . And not in a funny way , either , like Robot Monster . After I saw Hostel , I honestly wished for the end of Eli Roth's career , whatever effect that should have on the rest of his life . This is a man that simply should not be allowed to make movies . There is a point at the end of The Devil's Rejects where the movie could have gone in a different direction and done something completely different and probably bigger than it did , but its representation of futility and fate , while not exactly fresh , are at least somewhat satisfying . Although I have to say that I am much more excited about Zombie's soon to be upcoming contribution to the Halloween series than I am about this movie . I reckon this will become a footnote in his growing career . The movie gets hard to watch as the victims are punished and tortured , but William Forsythe offsets that for a while by giving them exactly what they deserve . There is a decidedly unexpected twist when the wildcard is once again introduced into the movie near the end , and I have to say that I'm glad that Zombie didn't just cop out and leave the ending open for a sequel . It's hard to watch at some points , but if you are a fan of any of Rob Zombie's work , I imagine there is something here that should entertain you ?

The script is stupid , the direction amateurish , the cops dopey ( not only do they fail to capture a slow , dumb serial killer , but they also fail to provide even the slightest protection to the victims ) , the psychiatrists ignorant and the actors portraying them ( and everybody else ) slumming ( John Saxon , what happened to you man ? ) .

990,"Text1: Vintage Altman Gosford Park is indeed one of Robert Altman's best films . Third best of all that I've seen , following Nashville and 3 Women . Still , I am a tiny bit disappointed with it . I was hoping it would be next to Nashville and 3 Women . I'm not sure if it will even remain in the third spot in my mind for too long . It's not as memorable as many of his other films that may not be quite as good . In fact , at this point I feel more of an affinity for his last film , the unfairly despised Dr . T and the Women . Still , one can't at all watch Gosford Park without being amazed at it . It ranks along with the many great European films in this tradition . It is undoubtedly most influenced by Rules of the Game , directed by Jean Renoir in 1939 . That film generally ranks at # 2 out of every film ever made on the Sight and Sound polls , taken every decade ( they're to be taken this year , 2002 , for the seventh time since the poll's founding ) . I don't agree with its high status ( refer to my own reviews , three of them , one individual and then two parts of a 1000 + word one , on imdb ) . I find it wonderful for the most part , but then it utterly falls apart by the end . Other films in the tradition include Ingmar Bergman's Smiles on a Summer Night , Luis Bunuel's Diary of a Chambermaid ( incidentally a remake from an American film directed by Jean Renoir , which I have not seen ) , and , most recently , Thomas Vinterberg's Celebration , aka Dogme 1 . These films all play with the relations between the master and servant class in varying degrees . Godford Park is perhaps the most complex in that respect : it gives equal time to both sides , allowing for a lot of character identification . It also contains an enormous cast , as you might expect from Altman , and all of the characters are perfectly developed , also as you might expect . The acting is brilliant . Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith were singled out by Oscar voters , both receiving a Best Supporting Actress nomination , but I don't know how they chose between the two dozen actors and actresses in order to arrive at those two . Everyone is equal to them , and I imagine a lot of the actors who didn't make it were suggested by the Academy members . The direction , of course , is beautiful . It's on par with the rest of Altman - I don't think he's ever directed poorly , even in his "" bad "" films . The score is beautiful . Stephen Altman's production design is miraculous - it was nominated for an Oscar , but defeated by Moulin Rouge ! . Moulin Rouge ! is merely showy . The production design here is subtle as hell . I do find some fault in the script . Most of it is brilliant . It won the Oscar for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen . I would have chosen Memento myself , but Gosford Park is nearly as deserving . The dialogue is always spot on , and the plot is fantastic - that is , until the murder . I'm not going to spoil anything , unless you didn't know that there was a murder ( sorry if you didn't , but it was in all the ads ! ) . It's just that the murder feels forced - a lot like the murder in Rules of the Game . It just never seems necessary , and what results from it is not as interesting as I would have hoped for . There's also a ton of setup for the murder in the plot , with tons of bottles of poison being shown and the victim nearly getting shot and so forth . And not enough results from it . The mystery is also not interesting . It was much more interesting - and in line with the theme - when the two groups were simply interacting . The explanation doesn't say anything that wasn't already implied , and some of the unforeseen relationships between the characters don't add as much weight to the drama as they are meant to . That's all a rather minor criticism , to tell the truth . It still works , it's just not as strong as I think it could have ( or should have ) been

Text2: If It Ain't Broke . . . I have nothing but the highest regard for Gerard Jugnot , Josie Balasko and Christian Clavier , all of whom are multi-talented and more than capable of directing a film like this so why they were content to put themselves in the hands of a guy whose directorial career peaked with Taxis 2 , 3 and 4 is anyone's guess . Unwisely the production company has left the names of Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost , who wrote the great 1951 version where Fernandel , Julien Carrette and Francoise Rosay made , together with director Claude Autant-Lara , a minor masterpiece , and were I either Aurenche or Bost I would be very angry indeed to see my name linked to this tepid remake which not even the usually reliable Clavier can make much of ; Clavier is , of course , a fine writer , witness Les Visiteurs but let's face it , Christian , you're no Aurenche . There are several changes : a monkey has become a bear , a snowman has become a scarecrow ; a classic has become a bad joke .

991,"Text1: Taut , tense and believable "" Witness "" has always been one of my favorite films and one that has struck close to home . My family comes from Pennsylvania's "" Amish country "" and I spent a great deal of time growing up around the Amish , even visiting their homes once in a while . When "" Witness "" came out , people finally started to take more of an interest - - or at least become aware of - - the Amish . Without this film , I very much doubt Randy Quaid would have played an Amish man in "" Kingpin . "" And so on and so forth . "" Witness "" is a very faithful adaptation of the Amish way of life , remaining respectful of the culture without resorting to the typical "" Hollywoodinization "" of the material . Yes , Kelly McGillis ' character does transform a bit , but that's essential to the story . All the other characters remain the same , and do not change , which I felt was a very important aspect ; how believable would this have been if , at the end , they all drove away in a car or something and ditched their roots . It'd be pretty embarrassing , I think . "" Witness "" is one of the best films of its genre and an excellent character study . It is intelligently made , almost never ( if ever ) insulting , and features one of Harrison Ford's best performances . The conclusion does draw out a bit and perhaps a few minutes here and there could be cut without really harming the flow , but in my opinion the movie is only better due to its length - - it doesn't cater to the teen audiences who can't appreciate longer and quieter , subtler thrillers . In a decade when chills and spills were almost always involving teens having premarital sex and being sliced and diced by nameless , masked killers , "" Witness "" had a new angle to draw upon - - and it's about a hundred times more thrilling , and believable , than any of the other films released during the era .


Text2: Sustained my interest throughout Roy ( Nicolas Cage ) has some problems . He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder , panic attacks , and gets totally hysterical when people leave doors open , don't take off their shoes , get mud on his carpet , etc . He takes pills for the many problems , but he accidentally knocked them down the garbage disposal and is a big frantic mess now , complete with nervous ticks of the face and exclamations of "" mmm . . . "" at the end of his sentences . That's a problem that severely interferes with his job as a con artist . He's not a con man , he's not a rip-off man , he's a con artist , with added emphasis on the "" artist "" part . He views his job as a beauty , a sort of majestic way of expressing himself , but not really , that's a lie , it's just something that makes him sleep better at night . He hates his job because it makes him feel dirty . It's not fun ripping off old people or fat people , but he is a high school drop out , how else can he get a decent paying job ? His partner , Frank Mercer ( Sam Rockwell ) , is a bit more at ease than Roy . He doesn't seem to mind his job all that much . Roy , on the other hand , is turning into a complete nut , and after going to a recommended psychiatrist , he musters up the courage to confront his 14-year-old daughter , Angela ( Alison Lohman ) , who is eager to escape her controlling mother and check out her long-lost big pop . The film has a lot of different stories going on - - the worry-wart who learns to put aside his nervous ticks , the long-lost father who reunites with his daughter , and the con artist who tries to give it up for a normal life . They all succeed as a story , but the film's only flaw is its wandering , which goes on far too long . Who cares ( and I mean that as a statement , not a question ) . The film is one of the great entertainments of the year . It has twists , turns , and a big streak of enjoyability running through it . Nicolas Cage is on a winning streak . First 2002's Oscar-winning "" Adaptation , "" now this ( rumored to be entered into the Oscar race for 2004 ) . Who would'a thunk it ? Sam Rockwell ( "" Confessions of a Dangerous Mind "" ) continues to impress , while Alison Lohman ( a 20-something actress playing a teenager ) shines and convincingly portrays exactly what the character needs . Ridley Scott ( "" Alien "" ) , the infamous British director , uses some great camera techniques here - - filmed in a blue shade with lots of different camera flashes , he subtly forces the audience into Roy's head , especially during sequences when Roy is having little breakdowns and the people and objects around him start moving at warp-speed . I'll admit that I'm a big fan of con man movies because I find them amusing . But "" Matchstick Men "" is not really a con man movie - - it's a movie about a con man who has to cope with his job and private life . And a movie about a con man who finds he has a daughter . And a con man who gets conned . It's all enjoyable , and though the film is long , I never felt very bored by it at all - - it sustained my interest throughout its running time . That's rarer and rarer nowadays .

992,"Text1: post-apocalyptic quasi-guilty pleasure that's better for Heston fans than those looking for I Am Legend I got what I wanted out of the Omega Man , though if it were a better made movie then I might feel the need to add it to my collection as opposed to sending it back as a rental . It starts off with a very funny and terrifically surreal set-up as Charleton Heston drives around in a red convertible , no one else in the city , with an 8-Track playing muzak . Suddenly , he stops in front of a building , sees something moving around behind the window , and takes out his machine gun firing off some rounds at the figure . Bizarre enough ? How about when he stops off at a movie theater , which has "" held over "" the documentary Woodstock , as Heston reels up the film in the projection room and watches it for what must be the 10th time ( he talks along with one of the interviewees at one point ) . So far in the film it's deliciously ambiguous as to what the hell is going on , aside from Heston being the only guy in a deserted city ( LA ) with a machine gun and love for the Woodstock film . Deep down , I knew that the story would soon have to unfold , but I wonder how classic the film could be if it continued on this experimental track of mind . The story then unfolds , and it's sort of hit or miss as far as 70s ( pre-Star Wars , post Planet of the Apes ) science fiction goes . A group known as the "" family "" survivors of a nuclear holocaust who go around in black robes looking like monks with pale faces and completely white pupils , are after Heston's ex-scientist , who somehow got a vaccine together for himself before the plague went totally widespread . He has a good hold-up in a penthouse , with an amusing bust of an old general he talks to and a big TV / mirror he uses for narcissistic purposes . Did I mention the guns ? Lots of them ; one wonders if scenes from this film are ever shown at NRA conventions ( ironically though , the scene where he shoots a monk who's somehow crawled his way up to the penthouse , was in Bowling for Columbine for a moment , which adds to it being unintentionally hilarious when it comes around ) . Soon though once the more strange parts of the film give way to the more typical ones ; the other survivors , not the ' family ' but some group who somehow didn't get infected ( though could ) , bring Heston into the fold , though with some mixed results . Chiefly that our hero gets to bed down with a foxy black lady with a huge afro , and one of the kids infected , who gets cured , stupidly ( more-so stupidly plot-wise ) tries to convince the ' family ' that they can be cured too , which is the last thing on their minds . As an action film , it's surprisingly not as intense as I imagined from hearing the bits of hype and seeing clips from the film . True , it's a lot of fun seeing Heston chew on the dialog and give just a look , or a laugh , and make it worthwhile as some typical Heston machismo , and if there is a situation involving lots of half-dead fellows with wicked intentions it's a sure-fire bet to have a guy like him around . But the story around it seems too undercooked - this is from someone who has yet to read Matheson's book - or rather not appropriately enough in ambiguity while at the same time not really raising any questions like the much more successful Planet of the Apes did . When it comes down to it , The Omega Man is a neat time capsule , especially for those who want to see Heston kick ass and sort of take names ( and maybe just to watch it for all the ironic reasons of a nut like Heston being president of the NRfantasy for him , who knows ) . Just don't go looking for a landmark .


Text2: strong performances + significant problems in NYPD drama Interesting to see the reactions to Pride and Glory on IMDb : some people like it a lot , so much so that they rank it as one of their favorite films of the year , while others rank it low , very low , saying it's low-end predictable trash that rips off from every other cop movie around including last year's We Own the Night ( that title comes up often , which I can't comment on as I've yet to see it ) . I might be one of those small handful that are in the middle : Pride and Glory is an alright cop drama , not amazing or really terrible . It borrows from many movies and TV shows , this much is definite , and its directorial style goes between fine competence with actual dialog scenes ( with the occasional noir-ish flourish ) and overbearing with the hand-held in action scenes . It seems as if no cop drama in recent memory can quite come up to the height that Narc reached with that - coincidentally in this case Narc director Carnahan had a part in writing P & G's script - and for most of the running time the film suffers from a lack of real stylistic vigor . But , thankfully a big but , the performances are all stellar all-around . From the big players like Edward Norton ( who , unless under duress or restraint by the studio , turns in fantastic work that's subtle for the camera but as intense as a theater performance ) and Colin Farrell ( gaining cred fast this year with this , In Bruges and underrated Cassandra's Dream ) , Jon Voight ( who , somehow , has bounced back from the STP-nightmare appearance in Bratz ) , and character actor Noah Emmerich ( often with one facial expression - tension and an inner sadness - but still good if not as good as Little Children ) , to Jennifer Ehle who plays Emmerich's dying wife who is , for every moment she's on screen , absolutely terrific and even makes great scenes out of otherwise OK elements . This is , in fact , a real actor's movie , unlike Righteous Kill which rested entirely on he heels of its two stars , and for all the black - and - white - and - sometimes - gray areas of the script - about a family of cops who become embroiled in one member , Jimmy ( Farrell ) and his incredulously corrupt dealings and murders - the bulk of the cast make it more than watchable : one is almost fooled from time to time , with all its rampant cursing and crazy bits ( i . e . threatening hot-iron on a baby ) , that it is great . But it isn't . So much of its plot is middling and only sparks of fascinating scenes keep it together , like when a sleazy Hispanic character pays a personal call to Jimmy's house while his family is home , and its final 15 minutes are a mix of wild hysterics ( a supporting character , part of Jimmy's corrupt crew , snaps in a convenience store during a ' pick-up ' and a big race-inspired protest happens on cue ) and a true-blue Irish bar fight that perhaps would've benefited from John Ford rising from the grave to guest direct . So catch it on TV , now that it's almost gone from theaters , if you haven't seen it yet , and judge for yourself if it's high , low , or in the middle of expectations . I'm in the middle , though it does seem like the kind of OK movie that may play better on repeat viewings when nothing much else is on .

Early Witchcraft and devil movie that predated "" Rosemary's Baby "" and "" The Exorcist "" but despite it's small budget is as good as either of those movies and the dozens of imitations that followed them . Eerie and spooky film about Witchcraft in New England that covers some 300 years from the Salem Witch Trials in 1692 to the beginning of the Disco Swinging era of the 1960's . The town of Whitewood is both in the dark and fog at all times in the movie with not a single ray of sunlight ever descending on it . This gives the town a really creepy look as well as unnerving everyone in the theater audience watching the film . It makes one feel that the movie was made in Northern Alaska during the time when it has six months of darkness instead of the state of Massachussetts . Gripping as well as interesting movie with a great ending sequence where good overcomes evil despite the overwhelming odds against it .

Text2: Fluffy romantic comedy from Colubmia for Evelyn Keyes and Glenn Ford . . . After giving Evelyn Keyes the star treatment in JOLSON STORY , her studio failed to promote her in anything but some innocuous follow-up films with the exception of one or two films . This is one of the better ones . THE MATING OF MILLIE is a frolic that was probably turned down by Rita Hayworth and given to GLENN FORD and EVELYN KEYES . Whatever , it ignites real sparks as a comedy , telling a story about a woman who must find a husband if she wants to adopt a little boy . The screenwriters find a number of amusing situations for Glenn and Evelyn and they make the most of their rather offbeat roles . It's their flair for comedy that makes the simple plot so enjoyable . WILLARD PARKER is excellent as a bachelor friend who never notices Keyes until she gets some "" warm-up "" advice from Ford about how to catch a man . Before you know it , he's on her doorstep asking to borrow a cup of sugar . RON RANDELL is the head of an orphanage who also has designs on Keyes but is a realist about the situation . The predictable happy ending is in sight long before it actually happens , but it's given a charming treatment . Movie buffs will recognize MABEL PAIGE as Keyes ' friendly elderly neighbor . As predictable as it is , it's still a charmer .

"" Here's a solid little Randolph Scott number with a fine supporting cast taking place only a few weeks after the Civil War has ended . That's unknown to Major Matt Stewart ( Scott ) , and his band of Rebels at the time they hijack a quarter million dollar gold shipment from a band of Union soldiers . Attempting to outrun the authorities that are soon to follow , they find themselves holed up at a way station with two stagecoach travelers who were on board when the Rebs sought cover for their getaway . Lee Marvin gets a fair amount of screen time as the Major's trigger happy , hot headed second , and the story offers a number of scenes where the two collide verbally and physically . It was somewhat of a breakout role for Marvin , who prior had mainly uncredited film parts and a few TV series appearances . The expected final confrontation between the pair however is interrupted by the young soldier Jamie ( Claude Jarman Jr . ) watching his commanding officer's back . It was somewhat of a twist to the story for this viewer , as all the while , the film kept making it a point that the young man had never killed anyone before , not even during the war . It brought full circle to a remark the Major made to him early in their story that before they got back home , Jamie would have to find a way to become a man . I guess I'm not used to seeing someone like Donna Reed in a Western , so her appearance took some getting used to . I can't say I was fully convinced with her character falling in love with the Major , considering the circumstances of their involvement with the Rebels , and even more so , the palpable difference in their ages . It didn't hurt that her traveling companion and self professed fianc√©e ( Richard Denning ) was such a lout , thereby setting up the comparison between himself and Scott's character . The near finale with the Major against the leader of the outlaw posse ( Ray Teal ) was somewhat original in it's execution and outcome . Oddly staged , it was surprisingly believable that the villain could be hauled away , stuck in his horse's stirrup . Thinking about it , I wondered how far the horse might have run and what the fate of Teal's character Quincey might have been . Would he have been dragged to death , fallen loose , or left to some other fate ? Curious to ponder if nothing else . Ultimately , the Major vindicates himself in his sweetheart's eyes when he and his partner Jamie drop their saddlebags of gold bars . You kind of wondered what would happen with all that gold , and in some measure , I still do . Left with the station agent and his daughter in law , there wasn't much in the neighborhood they could do with it all .

996,"Text1: Decent high concept movie Jerry Bruckheimer and his ' high concept ' movies never push any cinematic boundaries and don't exactly give your brain a workout , but they can be respected in their own right as they often provide two hours of entertainment , and that's what you get for your money with this film ; National Treasure . The film stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who goes on the trail of some rumoured treasure that has been hidden in the United States of America for centuries . To find the treasure , he must decipher a series of clues , each one leading to another clue , which in turn leads to another . This theory of the buried treasure has been in Cage's family for decades and our hero hopes to be the one to finally find it ! As you might expect , the movie isn't entirely serious but , to my surprise at least , it does attempt some form of intelligence . The film plays out like something of a history lesson , and the central theme of both the British and the Americans hunting for the treasure echoes the war of independence . That , coupled with a tour of the USA's landmarks , makes this one very pro-American movie ! The way that the plot plays out is very silly , and the backbone of this silliness comes from the idea of the characters stealing the declaration of independence . The idea of this is stupid , but the way that it transpires is even more so . However , it would appear that the film knows that it's ridiculous , and so it just has fun with itself . Unlike many films of this type , the jokes entwined in the plot are actually funny , and certain moments in the movie will no doubt make you laugh out loud . The action is generally well staged , with a car chase taking the central stage where that is concerned . Nicholas Cage has proved his ability to lead a film on numerous occasions , and he shows us why he's a good choice again in this film . While his performance in the movie isn't great , you've got to remember that he hasn't been given great material to work with ; and he does make the best of what he's got . The rest of the cast is rather forgettable , with the exception of a nice little turn from Harvey Kietel . On the whole , National Treasure won't be making cinema history ; but as no brains , big budget action movies go - this isn't a bad one .


Text2: Captain Marvel On The Cheap One of the most popular of superhero comic strip characters came to us in the middle seventies in the form of a very low budget television series that only lasted for two seasons . It had actually two Captain Marvels when Jackson Bostwick left and was succeeded by John Davey for season two . Since the grownup Marvel was merely a manifestation of the teenage Billy Batson and since Michael Gray as Billy was the main reason most of us watched the show , that the Elders decided Marvel needed another personality would be accepted without question . Billy and this older man Mentor played by Les Tremayne traveled around in this motor home and Billy was what we would call home schooled . But what home schooling he got . The Elders are a group of mythic heroes of the past and we only saw them as animated manifestations . Zeus , Atlas , Mercury , Achilles , Hercules from Greek religion and King Solomon from the Bible . Can't do better than that for teachers . The Elders would summon Billy through some kind of celestial pager and he would travel in his mind to see them . They'd offer him a piece of wisdom that would be necessary for a situation he'd be involved in shortly . When things became necessary , Billy would utter the single word ' Shazam ' and he'd morph into Captain Marvel . It certainly had a powerful cultural influence , but it never worked for me and Gomer Pyle never did become a superhero and he was always more than uttering ' Shazam ' . Les Tremayne came to films and television late , he cut his acting teeth in radio and that strong voice was one of the most familiar out there . Michael Gray and he never seemed to have any kind of life outside of each other which certainly could lead to all kinds of speculation about their relationship . Except for Solomon those Elders were Greek heroes and they sure had no problem with being gay . One thing is for sure , the cheapness of the production was manifested not just by the same stock footage used over and over again , but that I don't recall Mentor or Billy ever changing their clothes through 30 episodes . Still ' Shazam ' was entertaining kid's stuff and it seem to run in syndication for years afterwards . I've seen worse out there .

997,"Text1: Daughters of Darkness Euro-horror tale about what occurs when Countess Bathory and her "" female companion "" become "" involved "" with a troubled couple at a very elegant hotel . The husband is supposedly unkind towards his wife , who becomes seduced / bewitched by Bathory . I thought it was fantastic , but do believe many might be turned off by the rather icy presentation ( I wasn't ) . When anyone ever mentions EBath around me , from time to time , I will always think of Delphine Seyrig . She epitomizes theatricality in a good way . I love one scene , after the burial of a specific person , when the Countess opens her cape , as the camera pulls , back draping over her new acquisition . I think one can see the exact , pain-staking detail by the director and film-making collaborators to orchestratingly compose each and every scene . . I respect the approach given to the film and think their efforts work splendidly . I found each female lead exuding their own type of beauty . . and feel it's pretty difficult to take your eyes away from them . AS far as our male lead , I particularly found one scene fascinating as a layer is slightly unpeeled when he contacts "" his mother "" on the phone . One might just see why he's in such mental turmoil just from this slight gaze into his life before his courtship and marriage to Daniele Ouimet . I didn't think Ouimet needed to bring any acting into this film , I felt the director was using her beauty , hypnotic ( . . a term I throw around a bit too much , but that's the reaction I felt so I use it here ) as it was , to frame artistic shots within the frame with John Karlen . I also liked how the director won't reveal Countess as a vampire , per se , instead showing her blood drinking in one particular scene ( . . probably my favorite of the film , when Seyrig isn't given the camera to do her thing ) from afar . One thing that many might criticize ( . . that doesn't bother me ) is the deliberate slow pacing . This is an atypical horror film . . it's more stylized art film ( . . for instance , what the director does with a red scarf as it drapes over a colorful lamp with the room dimmed a specific hue ) where presentation from scene to scene is just as important as the characters , and what their goals are , within the scene . A user friend on the IMDb horror message board I felt was exactly right when he mentioned how Seyrig modeled her character after Dietrich . The way she moves her hands is exquisite , how she smoothly delivers her dialogue , how seductively she takes over the conversation and mood of each gathering , and the way she is dressed . She's an amazing sight , and I won't soon forget her "" departure "" from the film .


Text2: Boys A young prep school teen ( Lukas Haas , quite good ) gets involved with a mysterious young woman ( Winona Ryder , who doesn't register or emote . . not one of her better performances ) who has a secret she is hiding . During the film snippets of a past acquaintance ( Skeet Ulrich ) may answer that very secret . Chris Cooper has a thankless , clich√©d role as profane , short-fused father of Haas . Jessica Harper has the thankless role as Haas ' mother , the typical hush-hush-wife afraid of her hot-tempered husband . John C Reilly also has a minor role as a kindly officer trying to locate Ryder over the whereabouts of baseball star Ulrich . The oh-so-big mystery isn't anything to write home about and Ryder is merely a confused dame . The supposed fireworks between Haas and Ryder is non-existent & the film is really unfocused . We get a lot of story on Haas ' life in a school for rich annoying kids and with little chemistry between the leads ( not to mention a plot which doesn't provide us much in why either would prefer to have such a relationship ) , there is very little to get excited about . I'd say see the film for Haas ' performance , because the rest of this mediocre effort isn't worth your time .

998,"Text1: Outstanding Film Always enjoyed the great talents of Ray Charles during the 60's and especially his other great hits during his career . However , I never realized all the horrible hardships he faced being blind and how strong an influence his mother played in giving him the strength to get through his life and stand up tall and proud . This is truly a great picture which has many flashbacks and shows in detail every aspect of Ray Charles life , including his love of women and heroin addiction which he utilized most of his life . However , despite his faults he gave America great music and outstanding songs we will long remember . Jamie Foxx , ( Ray Charles ) gave one of the best performance I have seen in a very long time . A film you will want to view over and over again .


Text2: Story to tell the Young / Never ever Forget This was a very heartbreaking story of human beings , Children of God , being tortured on a daily basis by people without any souls and heartless beasts , called Nazi's . It is easy for the Nazi soldiers to say , "" Hitler told me to do it , "" but deep down in their own hearts they all knew it was wrong to treat any race or religion in this fashion . Kirsten Dunst , ( Hannah Stern ) , "" Elizabethtown "" , ' 05 played the role of a Jewish gal who had a mind of her own and wound up in a concentration camp in Poland and was placed in a camp for women only . Unfortunately , there is a baby born in this horrible place and the women did everything in the world to save the child's life . There is a scene which really shows how the Nazi's killed innocent beaten down human souls . A film you must tell the younger generation about and NEVER FORGET and never let anyone tell you it NEVER HAPPENED ! It sure DID !

999,"Text1: Cult classic ! This movie might very well be THE ultimate cult classic ever made . It certainly is my favorite . Never have I seen a movie with so much and such great cult value in it . It's not really an epic movie in terms of having large epic sequences and battles in it but it nevertheless is a movie that takes on some epic proportions , which of course is also not in the least due to Arnold Schwarzenegger epic appearance in this movie . He was in great shape for this movie and it actually was also on of his earlier movie roles . It definitely was the movie that launched him to stardom . Not that his acting is epic in this movie though . It actually quite honestly is laughable bad at times but this only really adds to the movie its cult value . But what really makes this movie epic to me is its musical score by Basil Poledouris . Throughout his career Poledouris has scored for quite an amount of potentially B-movies ( basicly all the scores he did for the John Milius and Paul Verhoeven movies ) but his scores always managed to uplifts the movie to a much higher level , making these movies always much more than just a standard B-movie . I really can't imaging how this movie would had been without his musical score . As a matter of fact I don't even think I would had ever watched this movie , had it not been for its music . With its $20 , 000 , 000 budget this was a fairly expenses genre production for its time , also especially when you compare the budget to John Milius ' previous projects . It's budget can be seen back in its nicely shot action sequences , it's production values with its settings ( it was mostly shot in Spain ) , costumes and sets . It makes this visual a nice movie to watch . It wasn't a big box office success though and the movie did not became popular until years later , when the movie reached it cult-status . The story isn't really much special though and it also sort of drags in its middle part , when the movie does not always succeeds at it to bring entertainment . The movie is at its best when it is not trying to be more than it in fact is . The story just does not allow it to make this movie a great perfect classic . When the movie tries to be more serious this becomes painfully too obvious . It's mostly an enjoyable movie when its action kicks in . Luckily the movie is filled with some good old fashioned swords and fist fights , mostly in the beginning and toward the end of the movie . It can be a pretty violent movie at times and it also features its fair share of blood and gore . Besides Arnold Schwarzenegger the movie also features James Earl Jones in a rare villainous role . I don't think that there at that many movies around in which James Earl Jones plays a villain , except of course from the Star Wars movies , in which he voiced the ultimate villain Darth Vader . It also has Max von Sydow in a real small role and Japanese born actor Mako in a role which made him known and popular , despite the fact that he already had received an Oscar nomination once , 2 decades prior to this movie . It aren't really the actors that make this movie a good watch though but more the characters which they portray . My number one cult favorite !


Text2: One of the weirdest , one of the most inaccessible , one of the greatest ! This is a very interesting and intriguing early movie from acclaimed director David Cronenberg . The movie is definitely not a formulaic standard piece of work . It features lots of odd hallucinating moments , mixed with sadomasochist sex . The movie does reach the point at times , when you're not sure any more if the main character is hallucinating , or if things are real . It give the movie a nightmarish like atmosphere , which is the reason why this movie can be regarded as an horror movie . But it's not a typical horror movie with scare moments , or monsters , or anything like that . It above all is a very imaginative movie that is not alway accessible or easy to understand but always interesting and intriguing to watch . In the beginning its not clear were the movie is heading to . The movie begins as a ' normal ' one , then the movie starts to show sadomasochist and erotic tendencies , before it turns into an hallucinating-trip , filled with gore and violence . The movie can be seen as a one that warns about the ' dangers of television ' when truth and fiction can not be told apart anymore and fiction actually starts becoming reality . It also uses some virtual reality themes to make this point , which was quite unique for 1983 , for no one had really heard about this concept at that time period . It makes the movie futuristic but at the same time also outdated in some of its themes , though the main concept of the movie is still relevant today , perhaps even more than in 1983 was the case . It's definitely not the most accessible movie to watch . It's highly imaginative and also quite odd at times . Yet the movie remains strangely perfectly watchable , even though you never really fully get to understand the things that are going on the movie . The movie chooses to leave many things unexplained and also ends with a suiting open-ending . Andy Warhol was right to call this movie the "" A Clockwork Orange "" of the ' 80's . The movie does a brilliant job at mixing various different movie styles and combine it into a unique of its own , type of style and atmosphere . Fantasy , horror , mystery , sci-fi , thriller , sex this movie has all those elements in it . The movie is very lively directed by David Cronenberg . His directing is probably the main reason why the movie in the end works out so extremely well . Before this he made mostly B-type of horror movies but with this movie he shows his true skills of greatness . After this 2 other great movies by him were made ; "" The Dead Zone "" and "" The Fly "" . Quite unique for a director now days to make three great movies in a row . Cronenberg seems to understand the genres he ventures into but always choose to alter it and provide the movie with an unique style of its own that can not be easily labeled . "" Videodrome "" is perhaps the very best and most obvious example of this . The only movie that got close to the style and atmosphere of this movie was Cronenberg's own movie "" eXistenZ "" , that definitely shows some similarities with this movie , also with its themes . "" Videodrome "" is still Cronenberg's most unique and imaginative work . Of course the movie is also definitely helped by it's visual and hallucinative atmosphere that is filled with lots of gore and violence . It's well made and good looking . It doesn't try to impress , though some of the techniques used in this movie were definitely unique and not done before . I was especially surprised by the gore in the movie . At first it didn't seem that this was going to be a gory one . It seemed more like it was going to be a psychological thriller , with supernatural elements about a ' killer ' TV station . Sort of like "" The Ring "" . Yet the movie in the end showed more and more gore in a realistic sort of way only Cronenberg can make it . The cast also does a good job at always keeping things realistic , no matter how unusual it all seems and gets . The movie is well written with some good dialog that is greatly delivered by its cast . James Woods does a good job","{""output"": ""YES""}"
