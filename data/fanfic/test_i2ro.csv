0,"Text1: Azura and Lavender walked down the main hall of Loonatics tower, leaving Lexi to take care of some things she needed to do. Heading toward the training room for their suit configuration tests, the two coyote twins were bubbling with excitement, especially Lavender. Lavender was overwhelmed with the fact that she and her sister were going to be part of the Loonatics, but she was also freaking out on whether or not she was going to embarrass herself in front of Tech. ""Jeez Lav, calm down! It""s going to be fine, I mean your not going to like make the tower into a tree or something like that, just show them what your good at and the rest will come with time. Relax and have fun ok?"" Azura said to her sister, because she was getting tired of all the constant worried chatter. ""Ok, but I just don""t want Tech to get mad at me, cause then maybe he won""t like me, and I can""t deal with rejection again. Remember what happened last time?"" Lavender reminded her sister. Last time Lavender was rejected by a boy she liked, she stayed at their mother""s house, till; their mother dumped her off at Azura""s unannounced. She stayed there for three months balling her eyes out every time she remembered something about the boy she liked, which was like every three minutes. ""Besides, aren""t you worried just a little bit, I mean you could make too strong of a bomb, and then you might blow the tower up!"" Lavender was always overly pretentious when it came to her sister""s explosives, since last time she got mad at her; Azura had decided to set off a miniature nuke in her suitcase as payback. (No coyotes were harmed, this is a cartoon, and the nuke

""Don""t worry, Hayato, there""s no reason to be ashamed of your happiness for me,"" my sister spoke up sweetly. ""What the serious fuck are all of you on?!"" I screamed out incredulously. How the hell had we even gotten on this subject?! Fucking hell, Yamamoto, was your purpose to try and embarrass me?! Like hell I""d ever trust you again! ...And did I hear Lawn Head and Sasagawa sobbing in the background?! Were they having an emotional moment together or something? What the fuck was going on?! ""Now, now, Senpai, don""t start jumping to conclusions,"" Yamamoto laughed out in amusement then. ""Gokudera just really needs the sunglasses so that his eyes won""t be irritated."" Lawn Head""s only response was to cry out his sister""s name and beg her to not leave him for a man with ill intentions, much to Sasagawa""s embarrassment. All I could do was grumble to myself and rub at my temples. A headache was definitely forming by this point. I felt bad for the Tenth, since Lawn Head would be his future brother-in-law if he ever got the courage to confess. The damn jock would undoubtedly be a literal cock-blocker throughout the Tenth""s and Sasagawa""s relationship, including after their marriage. The retard would probably never see little nieces and nephews because he was too overprotective of his sister. ""Here you go, Gokudera."" Yamamoto""s voice interrupted my headache-inducing thoughts then. A few seconds later, I felt someone grab my hand and place a familiar pair of sunglasses within them. ""Don""t touch me, Idiot!"" I growled out in a flustered state as I quickly placed the sunglasses over my eyes. ""I don""t want to catch your idiocy!"" Yamamoto just laughed, like I had just done","{""output"": ""NO""}"

She wandered towards the center, getting down on her hands and knees and letting her fingers brush over the bones all over the ground. It seemed the original Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton that had been on display hadn""t been moved either. Jemma suddenly looked up in surprise when Skye asked her if she had any flashlights. It wasn""t the question that had her stunned, but the name Skye used to address her. People very rarely called her by her first name, and no one had ever given her a nickname before. ""I don""t have any flashlights, but if the ICERs still work, they give off a small glow."" Jemma dug around in the bag, eventually finding what she was looking for and shaking off the giddy feeling Skye had given her for some reason. It took a few moments, but she managed to activate one pistol, and then the other, getting up and passing one to Skye. They didn""t provide much light, but it was enough to make sure they didn""t trip over anything. ""Based off of pictures I""ve seen, I""m fairly certain there is a garage and an employee break room this way."" Jemma pointed, though the direction wasn""t very clear in the dim lighting. She stepped over several bones, hoping Skye was still behind her, heading towards where she believed useful items would be. ""We are standing on the original site..."" Skye breathed in awe, taking the gun from the doctor and holding it out slightly to illuminate what part of the way she could. They could probably manage to find some flashlights in the garage or the staff break room that would be able to

Text2: Perhaps presuming they were still alive was a bit of a leap of faith, but Samus had a feeling a full squad of Federation marines wouldn""t go down too easily, especially if they were entrenched in a prebuilt outpost. After all, the crew of the Tyr lasted much longer that she would have expected, given that they only had the ship they arrived in, enough ammunition to cover a patrol run and were fighting creatures far stronger than anything that could occur naturally. Besides, the Chozo had a habit of building near areas where aggressive creatures, lived, using them as a sort of natural deterrent, so if the pirates were trying to explore the ruins, they""d have more problems than just the Federation. So that was the plan, she""d arrive and first confirm whether or the marines were alive, if they were, she""d try and land as close to the outpost as possible and make contact, if they weren""t...well, she""d treat this situation the same as she had Tallon IV, she knew there were Space Pirates present, at least Ridley wouldn""t be present this time, so she""d land someone out of the way, where her ship wasn""t likely to be found, and begin recon on foot. While she didn""t have any issues with the plan, she had a sinking feeling in her gut, comparing anything to the situation at Tallon IV was probably a bad idea, what she had thought would be a simple recon job there turned into her saving an entire planet, not to mention starting off the chain of events that resulted in the Phazon incident...she could only pray this expedition wouldn""t escalate in the same way.

Smacking his hands down on the mantel angrily, he dropped his head. ""It isn""t logical."" There was something desperate in his voice - in his posture. Something that made Molly""s heart crawl straight up into her throat. She took a step toward him, frowning now. ""You""ll figure it out,"" she assured, as she had done so many times over the years, unable to stop herself from offering the encouragement he needed even though she knew he would never hear it. ""You always figure it out."" Another slam, more hurried steps on the stairs - the door burst open. ""Sherlock?"" John Watson, dark circles beneath his eyes and an all too familiarly harried expression on his face, skidded to a stop just beside where Molly was still standing at the edge of the kitchen, his relief at the sight of his friend a palpable thing. ""You""re ok!"" Sherlock, who had pushed away from the mantel the moment he heard his friend approaching, turned and shot John a dark look. ""Of course I am,"" he snapped, stalking over and dropping himself into his chair. ""Whatever made you imagine that I wouldn""t be?"" Slightly out of breath, John breathed hard for several long, silent moments, his eyes never wavering from his friends face. ""You bolted from the interrogation - you never do that. Considering...everything...I was concerned."" Face going blank, Sherlock shoved up out of his chair again, nervous energy seeping from his every pore. ""I did not bolt,"" he corrected, haughty like he only ever was when he was lying through his teeth, ""I merely excused myself with haste."" Molly heard

""Love did not prevent my mother from spending the bulk of her time and energy on a galaxy that needed her far less than I did. Love did not prevent my father from disappearing for months, only to return a little more distant each time. And love did not prevent you from standing over me as I slept, contemplating whether to kill me or not."" He cocks his head, regards the ghost before him with blistering enmity. ""Did it?"" Skywalker stares at him for a long moment, and then, the frustration drains from his face, leaving him looking nothing but sad. His shoulders slouch ever so slightly and he shakes his head. ""Ben...there was so much more to it than that."" ""No, there wasn""t,"" he says roughly, shaking his head, his voice breaking. ""Not to me."" He sees when it happens, the moment those words truly strike home. Skywalker deflates before his eyes, shoulders dropping and expression going bleak. ""Ben, I never...I""m so sorry..."" ""Enough of this."" He squares his shoulders, lifts his chin with as much pride as he can muster, biting back against the inconvenient burn of tears. He will show no more weakness. Not today. ""I don""t want your apologies, old man - they""re far too late. And as for your pity, you can keep that as well. Despite what you may think, I am not that lost little boy anymore.

This brought them to a stale mate. The grownups watched on with amusement. They knew the kids would figure it out themselves. Besides, even though they were arguing, it was too cute to stop. ""Fine,"" Jack had an idea, ""I""ll be daddy, Henry will be papa, and you""ll be baby."" Elli glared, ""Whatever, I""m not going to be a good kid if that""s what you mean.""

Text2: His wife irritated me. Not at first, however, and rarely does irritation of anyone excel past that, but Eloise Lestrade was not an easy woman to live with, whether she could see you or not. Her moods were fickle at the best of times, positively beastly at worst, while her strange compulsions to clean or lock a single door countless times over tried her family""s patience. The woman could be strangely buoyant one moment, and then fall into the blackest of moods within the hour from the simplest of things. I applauded her husband for so calmly and stoically taking the cold insults and blubbering apologies and the occasional screeched profanities with godly patience. The daughters were ordinary but not without personality; Abigail was sweet and introverted, looking very much the copy of her mother, preferring to play with her father""s pen or typewriter over the kids in the street. Her sister, Evelyn, was much the same, but she only resembled her mother with her fair hair and blue eyes. She had the patience and commonsense of her father. She was attached to Abigail at the hip and the two were rarely seen apart; from what I gathered, Abigail was protective of her sister while Evelyn worshipped the other girl, like many young siblings to their older. All in all, the Lestrades were an interesting family to watch. Though the fits Eloise threw were hideous, and the drunken encounters of Gregory""s were pitiful, in true British fashion they squared their shoulders for the outside world and for the girls, continuing on like a commonplace family on a homely street. The pattern rarely shifted from that-for me, at least. I was left alone because they could not see me, and I could watch them live and cry and fall ill on","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He played me like matter. He found me, on the green bench, sitting, gazing, lost. He offered me what I needed most then. A distraction. And in return I did things for him. As long as I had a diversion, my conscious didn""t bother me. The most important thing was that I didn""t feel this great void anymore. Nothing else counted. It""s not like I had a future or a family, or my heart to risk. I had nothing. Nobody. At first he wasn""t very demanding, a little deal here a little delivery there.

He placed his hand on her forehead and found that it was hot with fever. ""You""re burning up."" He said his tone thick with concern. ""Where else do you hurt?"" Miranda swallowed hard, her throat was on fire and dry. ""My...stomach and head...and I feel horrible daddy."" She said breaking down into tears. Even at the age of fourteen Miranda cried for him when she was sick, but House knew this wasn""t the usual ailment.

The nightmare...the same stupid nightmare he had every night had come back...and scared him senseless. He looked around and found that he was in his old bedroom...alone. And realizing that not even Kakashi was there Sasuke began to weep. He did not like being alone in the dark. It was scary! He pulled his knees up to his chest and continued with sobbing uncontrollably. Suddenly the sound of rather clumsy footsteps protruded from the hallway and a light turned on sending a small luminous glow over him. ""Sasuke-san."" Kakashi yawned rushing into the room. Sasuke looked up to see a white haired man before him; Kakashi""s hair was all over the place, no doubt from just waking up from a deep sleep. His mask was sloppily covering his Sharingan eye and his arms were lazily at his side. ""Kashi."" Sasuke cried. Kakashi sat down on the bed and pulled Sasuke onto his lap.

When the Doctor awoke, he was near blinded by the intensity of the light bearing down on him. It was the kind of light one might find in a research laboratory or a police interrogation cell; on closer inspection, he found himself bound to a metal board in what seemed to be a combination of the two. Snapping his head from side to side, the Doctor found that Rory was bound to a board beside him, but that Amy was nowhere to be seen. The man considered shouting for her, thinking anything preferable to the awful images his imagination conjured up, but that moment, the door opened and in stepped a Silurian dressed in a white coat. Immediately, the Time Lord slammed his eyes shut and tried to appear as if he was sleeping, in the hope that the Silurian was more foolish than he looked; it was a long shot, he knew, but any chance was better than being caught. As luck would have it, his pretence seemed to have gone unnoticed, as the Silurian went about his business without a second glance towards the two captives. It was at times like these when the Doctor most envied his companions and their human status; it was far easier to disguise the racing beat of one heart than two. Nonetheless, as time went on, the Doctor began to relax a little more, for his fellow alien physician had ignored him completely, just as he had done Rory, who remained unconscious. It looked as if he might get away with it after all, as the Silurian moved towards the door. Then a groan came from his side and the Time

And so he set about preparing what he needed, snickering as he did so. This is going to be awesome, Eros thought to himself. And I have the perfect time and place for it too. The Yuletide Ball. It was the annual event that Nicholas St. North, along with the other winter and holiday spirits, prepare for all of Spirit Kind. It wasn""t just a Christmas-thing either, although the date for the event always falls on the 25th. Every spirit known-and unknown-to mankind was there. Well, not every spirit. Those who were against the Guardians and the Man in the Moon, and those who were-by their very nature-loners, were, of course, not there. The former were not invited, while the latter merely opted out on the festivities. As such, it was easy to imagine how rowdy North""s Workshop was. It wasn""t just a gathering of friends and allies, but of rivals as well. Already an argument had started between E. Aster Bunnymund and Groun D. Hog. Bunnymund was warning the Groundhog not to prolong winter, and announce spring as early","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""I made it, I just barely made it, didn""t I?"" ""I offer you your dreams,"" Jareth said, his voice still soft but becoming firmer. ""Just let me rule you, and you can have everything."" ""I don""t want everything,"" Sarah whispered, her heart beating wildly within her and tears of joy dripping down her cheeks. She had made it. She had again defeated the Labyrinth, and now the Goblin King was offering himself to her. The first time he had offered himself, she had refused him coldly, not understanding what it was he was trying to give her. He hadn""t been trying to just give her himself physically, but had been offering his love, the greatest gift he possessed. ""Jareth,"" she said gently, looking him fully in the face. ""I only want you."" She reached out her hand and grabbed hold of the crystal. Instantly, it exploded with light and the scenery changed. The ugly place, the threshold of the Underground, disappeared and was replaced by a huge balcony overlooking the whole of the true Labyrinth, the beautiful meadows and lovely town full of gorgeous homes. The brick archway that Jareth had appeared beneath turned into a balcony railing, full of roses and vines. It was still night, but now every star was showing, beaming down on Sarah. Sarah trembled as she looked into Jareth""s eyes again. ""Everything I""ve done,"" she said breathlessly, ""I""ve done for you. Jareth, never leave me. Never let me go."" His eyes brightened, and Sarah gasped as he moved one hand to the back of her neck and the other to her lower back. He pulled her against him, their bodies

Solace. Relief. Peace. The morning came with a beauty that left Eomer speechless as he rose and dressed. His body was terribly sore, reminders of the great fight of the previous day, but he felt a peace unlike any other flooding through him. The war was over. He had slept without nightmares, had slept more deeply than he could remember, and now there was to be a coronation in just a few short hours. Food was brought to him, and he dressed in his best clothes shortly after eating. He hadn""t brought much with him to Minas Tirith; only his weapons and what could fit in his saddle bags, but he had packed a formal dress outfit in case, beyond all hopes, Sauron would be defeated.

She whined piteously when Selvienne withdrew her fingers from where they had, quite unaccountably, slipped beneath Tonk""s pyjama top and stood up, offering Tonks a hand. The girl stubbornly crossed her arms and refused to move. With a sigh, Selvienne withdrew the hand, hurrying to answer a second, more urgent, knock. She ran a hand quickly over her hair before opening it, sure that all her patient grooming in front of the mirror had been totally undone by Tonk""s attentions. The figure she found standing in the hallway had its back to her, but the neatly tied, golden hair was easily recognised. ""Hey, Remus."" Tonks got up, hearing the name. She had been worried it would be something serious.

The very perfection of it set Ark""s teeth on edge.

Mere moments later and now ""decently"" dressed in jeans, boots, tank and leather jacket, I blasted into the sky to look for Sookie, consciously tuning out Pam""s lingering worry. Now if I could only block out my own emotions. ~*E&S*~ It was strange not to feel where Sookie was. Ever since Dallas, my blood inside her had quietly but persistently let me know exactly where she was at all times. It had been a surprisingly pleasant little humming buzz in the background of my consciousness and over the short period that we had been linked, that tingle of awareness had become unexpectedly soothing. I had experienced Sookie""s emotions ebbing and flowing like tides and although I had not known many joyful moods from her during that time - the girl had had a rough few weeks between the maenad and Russell Edgington - being connected to her so intimately had been strangely gratifying. In comparison, the emotional void left by the silenced bond was frustrating as fuck. My plan was to start my search at Sookie""s house, where I had last seen her. But as I approached the Bon Temp farmhouse by air, I was distracted by a tantalizing aroma carried on the wind. Diverting towards its source, which turned out to be the cemetery between Sookie""s home and Bill""s, I flew in closer. I slipped into the shadows of the tree line, taking care to stay out of sight until I had confirmed that no one else was in the graveyard. Hovering in the dark, I breathed the intoxicating scent in deeply, concentrating on the nuances. It was a fascinatingly sweet bouquet, a mixture of slightly varying individual fragrances that shared similar notes of honey and fresh grain. And Sookie. I","{""output"": ""NO""}"

I don""t want to be alone in my room.""Shilo felt her ears drop against her skull, as she looked down the hallway towards her room, before turning away. Making her way down hallways and away from her room, Shilo let herself wander all the way to the library. Making her way down two hallways, Shilo finally spotted the large wooden door. Running towards the door, Shilo, with a little difficulty, was able to pull the door open. Sticking her head in, Shilo found the room was dimly lit by the green shaded lamps. The bigger lights were off. Shilo pulled herself into the room, her nose and ears twitching as she listened to the water in Abe""s tank. ""Mr. Abe? Are you awake?"" Shilo called out, making her way to the glass of Abe""s tank. Shilo peered into the dully lit tank, ears twitching as she placed her left hand on the glass, hoping Abe would feel her presence, and she his. Instead of feeling his presence, Shilo felt that something was off; foreign. The room was to quiet and the air tasted strange. Ears tilted

""On second thought mum, I think I""ll just pop around to Stuart""s"" Vince said, quickly rising from the table. He dashed out of the door leaving a bewildered Bernie and an amused Hazel. ~*~ ""Fuck off""! Came the reply from the other side of the door. Vince grinned as he continued to knock loudly on Stuart""s bedroom door. His friend was hung-over and Vince wanted to make him suffer. ""I said fuck off""! Stuart shouted. ""For fuck""s sake Vince""! ""How did you know it was me""? Vince asked. ""Because no-one else would dare to act like such a twat to me""! Stuart called back. He opened the door and allowed Vince to come in. Stuart was dressed only in his boxers. He knew full well that Vince would cop a look when he came in. That was half the fun with Vince, keeping him hanging on, waiting. ""So what brings you here""? He asked as Vince flopped down on the double bed. ""Day off"" Vince replied simply. ""You want to do something""? ""Like what""? ""Cruising""? Stuart said with a wide grin. Vince rolled his eyes. ""You mean find you *another* shag whilst I watch on? No thanks, I see enough of that on a night"" Vince replied. He grinned to show that he was joking, although a tiny part of him felt that bitter resentment. ""Aw Vince, you know I love you"" Stuart said with a smile. He grinned wider as he got the reaction he always got. Vince""s features became soft,

The teacher was facing the blackboard, so she didn""t see him. ""It""s nice of you to join us, Mike."" His teacher, Mrs. Baudian, turned around and stared at him. ""Do you have a good excuse for being late...again? Mike slowly turned to face her. ""Um, I-"" ""Maybe he was busy washing his hair in tomato sauce."" A boy suggested. The whole class began laughing. Mike rolled his eyes. ""Such a lame insult and the class laughs.' ""Enough!"" Mrs. Baudian yelled. The class calmed down. ""Just sit down, Mike."" Mike obeyed and sat down in his assigned seat. [XxXxX] It was already an hour later, and Mike had already received the usual twenty insults that he always gets. The small notes that had the insults on it was given to him by the same three boys. Those three boys were just lucky that Mike hadn""t had a chance to hit them yet. As another note came his way, he tapped his fingers against the desk in irritation. ""That""s it.'

He stopped when he heard a voice over the small intercom on the arm of his chair. ""Your guest is here."" The voice informed him. ""Let him in."" Father replied. The Delightful Children exchanged a quick glance before turning as one to watch a familiar figure walk into the large throne room. The Common Cold walked up to the foot of the tall throne, looking up at Father through bloodshot eyes. ""I don""t usually take jobs..."" The Common cold said wearily, looking over his shoulder. The Delightful Children noted that there were several guards standing by the door watching him. Obviously, the Common Cold had not come here as a guest. ""I go to the meetings, but I work alone."" ""And that is why you""re such a failure."" Father replied. The Delightful Children chuckled while the Common Cold huffed angrily. ""I want you to deliver this for me... you could infect one of the Kids Next Door without their even being aware of it. By the time they realize... it will be too late.""

Zero looked back quickly to see several maverick hunters hot on their trail, none from his unit thankfully, and he didn""t see X among them. Their bike wove through the trees expertly as Panther fought to lose their pursuers, but they kept pretty good pace with her, hot on her tail the whole time. ""Damnit.""

22,"Text1: When she got home from the hospital to an empty house - other than Zillah of course - Margaret curled up on her bed with the dog and cried. The doctor had done a thorough check, and had found a lump in her breast. He was fairly sure that it was cancer, and had started running a few tests. When he got the results back, Margaret would have to return and face the fact that she could be very sick. Zillah allowed herself to be cried on. She knew that Margaret would want to put on a brave face for the rest of the family, but for now she was allowed to be afraid. For now, Zillah was the strong one, and would do anything for her. -DK- When Don and Alan made their way to the car, knowing that Margaret wasn""t going to last much longer, Zillah sat at the top of the driveway and watched them go. Looking at her, Alan remembered what Margaret had said about Zillah knowing before anyone else about her cancer, and he paused in front of the dog. Kneeling, he looked her in the eye, and choked back a sob. It was clear from the way Zillah leaned forward and licked his face in comfort, before nudging him with her nose towards the car. Margaret was dying, and Zillah was telling him to be by her side. After that, Alan always turned to Zillah when he though one of his children could be in danger - for she always knew before anyone else. And as long as she didn""t give him that look when Don was out on a case, he knew he didn""t have to worry as much. A/N: Next up we have a series of extremely short episode-tags - all to

All the scientist could do was hang on to the man""s hands and arms. When the hostages were in the center of the room, the man threw Harrison to the floor and stalked away. Somebody knocked into Harrison, sending his hat to the floor. Afraid to try to pick it up, Harrison instead opted to try to tuck up as tight as he could. With some difficulty he managed to get his legs bent and closer to his body, but people were still shuffling around him, some crying, some glowering down at him. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for interrupting your party. You""ll be returned to your festivities just as soon as our demands are met,"" a short round man declared, stepping forwards as lights were turned on, covering the group of hostages in a circle of light.

It isn""t completely inappropriate, even if it""s the angle is a little lower than common standards, and it""s obvious he isn""t wearing anything.

It""s crunchy, cold, and it makes a crisp ""popping"" sound once you bite onto it. The faintly salty, slightly fishy taste of it also doesn""t help. The fact that it was also known as ""caviar"" and could be quite expensive depending on its handling before it was served also made Madara dislike it more (He was a cheap bastard and he liked cheap things. The roe, if it was good, would cost him more than thirty kunai and that was considered A LOT since it was during the time of the Clan Wars. Sometimes, it would even cost some people their first-born child.) Izuna had asked him once why he hated eating it, besides the obvious reasons for his revulsion of the dish. Madara""s reply?

He lifts his head to catch his breath and take the opportunity to appreciate the boy laying under him; those lust filled blue eyes, kiss-swollen ruby lips, the sound of him panting, his hardening cock pressing against his thigh. ""You look so beautiful. Let me just look at you so I can remember this moment and treasure it always."" Will smiles and nods. Why does he keep talking that way? He""s been acting strange since we first saw each other again after all those months. ""Will, I""m going to ask you something. You can say no if you want to but I wanted your permission first.""

By the way, what happened to your fur?"" ""Uh, don""t worry."" Sesshoumaru sighed, running a hair through his hair. ""Just my step-mother."" He gripped the sword with one hand. ""Want me to be handicapped?"" Korujin shook her head. ""No. I""m ok."" She brought up the blade, and twirled it to face the boy. Sesshoumaru spread his feet, and brought the blade round, as Kurojin took a swipe at his face. As the blades locked, sparks flew out. Sesshoumaru drew the blade back. Kurojin stumbled, having taken all her weight on that one move. He swung in past his waist, then back up, brushing it over the girl""s throat. ""Dead."" She gritted her fangs, and leaped away, swinging the blade out as she did so. Sesshoumaru felt his robe being cut, as he took a step backwards. She landed on fours, the blade in her mouth. Pulling it out, she leaped back into the air, drawing the blade up, and over her head. Sesshoumaru concentrated on putting his mass at the bottom of his feet, drawing the blade across his face. Silver and bronze meet in a flash, as Kurojin came down, crashing the blade into Sesshoumaru""s. The boy didn""t even flinch, as her weight came on her self. By placing his feet like this, he absorbed the counter. With an effort, he pushed his blade out. With a hiss, Kurojin span away from his body, and landed in a heap on the dirt. He brought the blade to her face. ""Dead."" She slashed the blade at his ankles. He leapt up like a bolt of lighting, flipping over her fallen form.

I might have fleas,"" he jumped up suddenly. ""I need a drink!"" and dashed away. Again, it was a stunning night. Goldensun slowly padded into Lavenderstar""s den. ""Lavenderstar?"" He meowed.

So it had fallen into my paws to do something that should have happened a long time ago,"" hisses and mutterings started up at Lavenderstar not being here. ""Quiet, please. Now, Marshpaw, would you step forward,"" he ordered, more than asked. The she-cat padded elegantly out from the parting crowd. Her long marsh brown pelt glowed tinted silver in the moon and star light. Her flecked amber eyes burnt coal bright. Goldensun""s heart swelled and fluttered like a caged bird. He couldn""t help but grin. She looked beautiful. And she looked more like a warrior than ever. Goldensun wasn""t to sure why, but he wanted to protect her more than anything. ""E-hem, Goldensun!""

They both set their luggage in the bedroom and exchanged a smile. ""Is that all the bags?"" Derek asked. ""Yeah."" Addison answered him, slipping off her shoes and socks, ""I""m so thirsty."" Addison left the bedroom as Derek began unzipping a suitcase. She walked down the stairs and headed towards the kitchen. A sudden sharp pain in her right foot stopped Addison in her tracks. She cried out in pain as she reached for the wall, balancing on her left foot and raising her right, only to see droplets of blood on the hardwood. ""Derek!"" Addison cried out as she slowly lowered herself to the floor with the aid of the wall. Drawing her foot closer to her, Addison""s face scrunched up in pain. A small shard of glass was lodged in her foot, causing the pain and the blood. Derek, who left his suitcase mid unpacking, hurried down the stairs and kneeled down next to Addison. ""What happened?"" he asked, a look of panic on his face. ""I must have missed this piece when I was cleaning the broken glass from the other night.""

There were no commercial breaks, no team of cops that was looking for them and interviewing people, finding leads and closing in on the killer.

Go ahead, Chase-who do you want to die, if not House? Me? Yourself?"" ""None of us,"" Chase said stubbornly.

Not with Snow breathing down his neck, and not with his bed shared by a different suitor every week.

No one is complete without a past, a childhood or even parents. Lightning himself is a living mystery and Doc was determed to find out who exactly Lightning McQueen was. He needed to know.

""Okay."" André says as their return to Tsunade""s room. ""Humrum. Remember boys, ANBU is a totally covered division. Keep this secret to a minimum. Dismissed."" Tsunade says. ""Over here, boys.

""As you two are spending more time with my children and as both of you are going to be me and Kakashi""s replacements..."" Minato says. ""Humum."" The boys say. ""It""s just a precaution.

""Are you sure you want to choose truth?"" He then asked, challenging her. ""I""m sure!"" Kaede replied, looking determined. ""All right. So, Kaede-chan, do you have a boy friend?"" Hikaru asked obviously curious. ""Is it really necessary for me to answer - HEY!"" Hikaru, once again administering the cruel punishment on her defenseless fingers, interrupted Kaede""s remark. ""You should just answer the question, Kaede-chan~"" the twins chimed in singsong voices. ""No, I don""t have a boy friend and I""d like it very much if you would let go of my hand now."" She answered, seeming to be really cross with the devilish twins although no one from the Host Club were really surprised. Either they knew how irritating the twins could oftentimes be or they were aware of just how much Hikaru and Kaoru pissed Kaede off on a daily basis. Perhaps it was a little bit of both. Feeling dejected at how honest Kaede""s answer was and scared at how angry she was becoming and of what the consequences of her anger would be, Hikaru released her shaking fingers albeit reluctantly. An awkward silence followed Kaede""s turn but she pretended not to notice. Without flinching, she spun the bottle and waited until it stopped at one of the hosts. A few turns later when the awkwardness died down and the fun was back, Kyouya finally got a turn and the twins bravely challenged the almighty Shadow King. He chose truth. ""Kyouya-senpai,"" the twins began, pointing towards the aforementioned upper class man. ""What is your relationship with Kaede-chan?"" ""What kind of stupid question is that?"" Kaede asked, appalled by her inclusion in the","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Text2: She was still unsure why, but every morning she would still wake alone, Max gone and the house quiet. Zoe was never a woman who hated her body, and in fact she often used it to her advantage, but towards the end of her third month of pregnancy, she woke up feeling decidedly uncomfortable in her body. Max used to mention how much he loved her body all the time, but now he didn""t, and when she looked herself over in the mirror all she noticed was how it had changed, and in her mind not for the better. Forgoing her usual dress, she opted instead for scrubs and trainers, going into work without even a glance at her make up or hair. Max was waiting outside with a chai for Zoe, having taken note of her schedule so he could try and match their shifts. He smiled when he saw her car pull into it""s parking space, but it quickly faded when she stepped out looking quite unlike her usual self. As she opened the back door to get out her bag, Max approached hesitantly. ""Morning. I got you a tea."" ""Thanks."" Zoe gave a halfhearted smile, shutting the car door with a sigh. ""...How are you feeling?"" Max asked, worried she may have morning sickness, though aside from a couple of episodes early on it wasn""t something that seemed to affect her. ""Fine."" Zoe replied, going to step around him. After a second""s hesitation, Max reaches out to grab her arm, stopping her. He then reaches up to take her hair out of it""s ponytail, using his fingers to brush it. Once done, he leans forward to drop a kiss to her nose ""There. I knew you looked different somehow.""

And when I go to the battlefield with thought that I will kill one of your friends, I don""t feel very well. It""s true, that on the ozher day, there will be a new warrior standing in front of the base, but it won""t be the same man."" Viktor said sadly and Sniper sighed. He was looking at Viktor""s lips. They were sharp edged and their look in the moonlight was magical. ""So this is the point. To solve the proble..."" He couldn""t end his sentence, because Liam with a velocity of bullet turned to him, caught his chin and crushed their lips together. Viktor was looking at him with eyes wide opened. Liam""s eyes were closed. His lips were gently touching Viktor""s. They were soft, although there were sharp words coming out of there often. Sniper felt his lips like refreshing water. Silky, trembling weakly and keeping his mind crazy. Australian""s hand drowned into Viktor""s black hair and played with his strands. Viktor leaned his palm on Liam""s chest and he felt his heartbeat. Viktor closed his eyes and moaned slightly. He put his hands around Sniper""s waist and pulled him into the deep kiss. Liam felt the slight touch as the German doctor stroke his bottom lip with his tongue. Sniper made sharp inhale and kissed him harder. He pushed him a little, so Viktor had to be pushed a little bit back. Liam replaced his hand from Medic""s hair

41,"Text1: At ""famous,"" Kagome""s gaze darted down, afraid of what celebrity she had apparently savaged and murdered in cold blood. She felt her body go cold. Laying before her was one of the mayor""s daughters. Her shocked eyes flew to Kikyou, who was nonchalantly fixing her long black hair into a tight bun at the back of her head. ""Not to worry, childe. The corpse will be disposed of in a fashion so as to not expose you or our kind. You must take care not to reveal yourself to the world of humans. If you do, the wrath of ages will fall upon all of our heads. You don""t seem to be the sort of girl who wants to bring about the Apocalypse."" Kagome stared at her, handkerchief held limply between her fingers as her brain frantically searched for a logical explanation to what her life had become. She came up with nothing and found herself fervently wishing for a time machine. Kikyou was walking out the door and into a hallway by the time Kagome came to her senses and jogged after her. ""...must block out all sunlight in your haven. If you wish, I""ll make arrangements for a new haven if your current home is insufficient. Otherwise, go home and board up your windows before the sun comes up, and leave nothing to risk. I""ll come to you at nightfall."" Before she knew it, they had arrived at the foyer of the lavish building, Kikyou opening the door to reveal a taxi parked in the street. ""I bid you good evening, neonate. I will call upon you tomorrow,"" Kikyou stated, walking Kagome down the stairs to street level. Before opening the taxi door, Kagome spun on her heel and held out her hand.

She""s still hooked up to the transfusion."" Kakashi stared off into space, thinking. Because for a smart girl like Sakura, she sure was stupid. Trying to take the easy way out from her pain. Weeks had passed since Sakura""s ""accident"" and not many people knew about it. But for those who did, they kept a very close watch on her. So far Tsunade, Naruto, Kakashi, Ino and Shizune had lectured her over it, and it always came down to, ""Why would you do something like that to yourself?"" But she never answered them. At first it was because she didn""t have an answer to give. When she finally did come up with a reason they never said anything further, being to shocked that she of all people could be capable of such a way of thinking. ""The more I thought about him the more I""d cry. The more it would hurt and the pain would just keep getting worse. I didn""t want to feel the pain anymore. So when I did it, the pain finally went away."" she told them. That was the same quiet response she just gave Ino also. They were at a small homey family restaurant in a booth by the wall at the far end of the room. Ino sat there wide eyed. ""But why would you want to destroy your own body over it? How could psychical pain be any better than the pain that""s in your heart?"" she breathed out quietly. It surprised Sakura. No one usually continued after she said that.

42,"Text1: She turned. Three people were standing uncertainly at the edge of the crowd, looking tentatively at the barrier. The woman was a beautiful Indian lady in a sari, wearing gold bangles. The man was a jovial fellow with red hair and a broad, pleasant face. They were both quite good-looking. The child between them was obviously theirs, but he looked like someone had just smashed their attractive features together without concern for what fit where. He had his father""s broad nose on his mother""s narrow face; his mother""s dark hair, highlighted with his father""s bright red (and curled in a mess that was all his own). His eyes were an unremarkable muddy green, and his teeth appeared to be too large for his mouth. He smiled at Dora in a daft way and pulled a face at her. She laughed, liking the ugly boy on sight, and held out her hand. ""I""m Dora Tonks,"" she said. ""Sanjiv MacPherson."" ""Are you Muggle-born?"" Dad asked. Sanjiv nodded. Dad grinned. ""Let me walk you through it."" He looked at Mum and Dora. ""Literally. I""ll see you both on the other side."" Dora and Mum slipped through the redheads and leaned against the barrier (one of the redheaded boys came at the same time, carrying a younger brother). A moment later, they were on Platform Nine and Three Quarters, peering through the steam at a scarlet train. Dora looked up at Mum and grinned widely. Four more redheads came through--the mother, carrying the little girl, and the other school boy, his hand tightly on another brother""s shoulder. A moment later, the redheaded father came through, a child in each arm (these two perfectly identical to one another). ""Bill!"" the little girl said, reaching for the oldest boy, who took her from their mother and

""I""ll see if I can get you some food you can actually look at."" With that, he leaves. Fifteen minutes later, they turn off the sound on my videos, and half an hour after that, Valentine, the medic from my prep team, comes in, carrying an emergency bag. She smiles faintly. Her hands are shaking. I see one of her own fingers is in a splint. Carefully, she touches my side, where the deep purple bruise above the rib is. I gasp at the pain. She presses harder, and I almost faint. ""It""s fractured, I think,"" she says. ""But just a crack. There""s no broken edge. The only thing to do is kill the pain while it heals."" She hands me a pill, and I take it gratefully. It occurs to me after I swallow it that it could be poison, but nothing happens. I don""t really care. A quick dose of poison seems better than finding out what the equipment in the ceiling does. ""I thought something in there ripped,"" I say. She inspects the bruise.

He reached back down and his fears were confirmed: there was a large, steel pole sticking out of his side. That must have been what made that grating sound. But that means... It was sticking out his back. It was also covered in something sticky. Blood. At that moment, he realized that his whole back was wet, as well as his head and arm. He also noticed that his jacket was gone, his right boot was off, and his shirt was shredded. He reached up to his head and felt that the back of his head had a huge gash in it. Blood was slowly oozing out of it. He touched the gash and almost screamed out of fear and pain. Is that... my skull? By this time, he could kind of make out the shapes of the ruin he was buried in. A large chunk of wall was pinning down his left leg, and a wooden beam was on the other. He slowly turned to the right and saw a familiar sight trapped under an old conveyor belt: his right arm. He tried to slowly shift sideways to grab it, but as soon as he moved, the rubble shifted again. The steel beam over his head shifted backwards, and pieces of concrete and bricks fell on him, pinning his arm down. ""Hey! Is anyone there? Hey help! Al, Riza, anybody!"" He yelled as loud as he could, but he heard no response. For the first time in a long while, he started to cry. ""Dammit, is no one out there?"" He kept yelling until he went hoarse. The last thing he thought before everything went black was

Text2: Once upstairs, Leo shut the door and walked slowly to the window. He rested his left arm and forehead against the cool glass, letting it calm him down from his earlier exercises. After a moment of reflection, he turned to his bed. Mikey and Raph both had slightly larger beds with tables near them, since they were the worst off. Don was sleeping on a futon, and Leo had his own small mattress in the corner, away from everyone else. He tromped towards it, taking off his gear and mask in the process. They were carefully laid to the side as he fell quickly into a fitful sleep. Leo""s eyes quickly darted back and forth, coming to rest on each member of his family. They were all calling out to him, each of them injured badly. Master Splinter lay burned beyond recognition, his feeble hand reaching out for his eldest son. Raphael was barely moving, a caring Donatello trying to protect his brother. Mikey was backed against the wall, the pain from his legs bringing tears to his eyes. Leo stood, turning his eyes back towards the imminent threat- Karai. The sword-wielding daughter of the Shredder was looming over him, her eyes red with anger. ""You are far too weak, Turtle. Your family is dying. I had hoped to kill you, but watching you suffer is much better..."" She raised her sword, throwing it straight and true. The point of it embedded itself in his master""s chest, causing him to cry out in pain before falling still. Her other sword was held in her hand as she leapt at Don and Raph, a single slice finishing them both off. She then turned to Leo knowingly. ""First your father, then your brothers, then your lover.

""Cami, you do not have to do that,"" Hayley finally spoke up, walking over to her and taking Hope from her. ""It isn""t necessary for you to do that for us,"" Elijah said, agreeing with Hayley as he moved to set the table. Cami smiled, waving her hand in a dismissive move. ""I insist, it""s the least I can do for you two right now."" Hope cooed at Hayley as she kissed her on the forehead. ""Hi there, baby girl,"" Hayley said with a grin. ""I will just go get my keys and the diaper bag and then we will go be on our way,"" Cami said, looking from Hayley and Hope to Elijah and then back once more before turning and going to retrieve her keys. Hayley waited until Cami was out of ear shot to say what she wanted to say. ""She""s a great person to have around, isn""t she?"" Hayley asked, looking over at Elijah. Elijah nodded.

""Do you walk here everyday?"" Grissom asked as he sat down on the steps beside her. ""I walk everywhere."" she panted, wiping sweat from her eyes. ""Do you live far from here?"" Grissom already knew from Ms. Shelley that Alexe lived across town. He waited to see how she would answer. Alexe tossed her head nonchalantly. ""Couple of miles."" That was an understatement. Although Grissom was aware that being alone with her might bring up questionable issues, he was uncomfortable with the thought of anyone, let alone a fifteen year old girl walking across Vegas unaccompanied. There had to be a better solution. ""Maybe we could find a meeting place closer to your home."" he suggested, as if they had been talking about the weather. ""Maybe."" she answered with equal enthusiasm. This was typical of the conversations that had developed over the many weeks. Sometimes the better part of the hours they spent together were spent in silence, just thinking. Two loners assigned to improve the other""s communication. The irony of it was not lost on Grissom.

He had faith in his sons plan but luck favored the prepared he had learned that the hard way too many times. Looking back at his ship he thought back to when the top deck had been a chaotic confusion from time to time as a teenage boy would run dragons hot on his tail from one thing to the other trying to be of use. Then to a sooner time when he had earned his iron and killed his first men. That night he had become a man and took the name wingless stating that he was no longer a man but a dragon without wings.

Resting her head on the cool surface of her desk, she let out a long sigh and wished that she hadn""t drunk so much this morning. There was something nagging the edge of her consciousness and for the life of her, she couldn""t grasp what it was. Tsunade closed her eyes in concentration. It felt like a small detail had escaped her notice and it had something to do with Naruto. His story was certainly odd but if Sasuke were really seen at the vicinity, it was adequately confirmed. She usually spared him the doubt but Naruto had had his share of nightmares when it involved the Uchiha. And there was the wound as well. The wound. Her eyes flung open. That was it. It didn""t heal. She frowned, giving herself the benefit of doubt, but given up just as quickly. The wound was really there and it was small, hardly something worth mentioning. She had seen Naruto suffering a much bigger, deeper one and it had disappeared without a trace save for ripped clothes in a matter of minutes, even seconds. The Nine Tails had made sure of it. And this one, courtesy of Sasuke, had not. Tsunade bit her lips in frustration and slumped deeper into her seat. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she had that missing link but unfortunately, her brain was unwilling to cooperate and hand her the answer. Naruto got it from Sasuke who wanted him to come and give him a little visit. Sasuke. Always coming back to Sasuke. And that bastard Orochimaru, she cursed inwardly. ""A shitty birthday. Like always."" The branches felt rough under his feet and cold

Neither did the silent tears running down Sakura""s cheeks. Syaoran was a shivering mess, his face too pale, his skin too cold, and Kurogane had to struggle with all his might not to holler at him. ""You""re fucking crazy,"" he hissed, insides numb with cold relief. Waves of guilt quickly overcame every other expression on the kid""s face, but before the word ""I""m sorry"" could leave his mouth, something wriggled under his shirt and Mokona jumped out. ""Syaoran!"" ""I""m okay."" It was definitely a lie. His voice was too faint and he hadn""t stopped shivering, but the kid didn""t seem to care. His amber eyes were focused on the princess, on the wet tracks on her face, on the question she had not even given voice to. ""He got away,"" he murmured and it would have been a prelude to an apology had it not sounded so dead. ""I couldn""t..."" The words trailed off and the small body swayed forward once before Kurogane caught it. He barely heard Sakura""s surprised gasp or Mokona frantically calling the boy""s name, his whole concentration spent on the attempt to keep panic down and let common sense come first. The kid""s breathing was shallow and he was impossibly cold, but the ninja couldn""t find any life-threatening injury, only a few bruises and small cuts. For someone who had just survived his clone""s brutal assault and a long walk through the storm, he was relatively unharmed. ""He""s all right,"" Kurogane said, letting the breath he had unconsciously been holding go. ""Probably just tired. He should rest."" Fay nodded and Sakura bit her","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Quickly, they looked away when they recognized what they were doing. Kakashi sighed at their stubbornness. Kids these days... After a moment, Sakura gave in to curiosity. ""What kind of training can we do here?"" ""Water walking,"" Kakashi said cheerfully. They gaped. Internally, Kakashi chuckled in amusement. It was so much fun to mess around with his students"" naïve little minds. One of the few perks of the job, in fact. After a moment, Naruto""s eyes narrowed into suspicious slits. ""Can you really do that?"" he asked dubiously. ""Of course,"" Naruto""s teacher answered. ""Here, I""ll show you."" A faint blue glow enshrouded the bottom of Kakashi""s feet. He stepped off the edge of the wooden deck. Naruto and Sakura watched in amazement as his foot connected firmly with the surface of the water and stayed their. His other foot came down to join the first, and Kakashi began to walk slowly away from the deck. He moved several paces before stopping and turning to his students. ""See?"" ""That""s awesome!"" Naruto exploded. ""How do you do it, Kakashi-sensei!?"" ""Well, it""s basically the same as the tree climbing exercise, only this will teach you how to mold a constant amount of chakra. To do this, you need to expel chakra from your feet into the water and constantly release it in order to keep yourself balanced."" Sakura was nodding along in comprehension. Naruto""s face was screwed up in fierce concentration as he struggled to understand Kakashi""s explanation. ""Well, just try it,"" Kakashi said. ""Right!"" replied the determined Naruto. ""First, accumulate chakra in your feet,"" Kakashi commanded. Quickly, his students obeyed, forming the Ram seal often used to assist in concentrating chakra. Blue

I was always aware that there was something defiantly different about me, but I would never have thought us to be more than.... Siblings. Well, I guess I should start at the beginning, eh? Well, Happy to meet you, I am Jenny. Jenny Fenton to be correct. Yeah, I am the daughter to the Fenton""s who make all that ghost hunting gear, and Yes I am aware that most people think that they are freaks. But, that""s never bothered me. Anyways, I am fifteen and I am a twin to none other than, Danny. I also have an older sister, named Jazz. She can get kind of annoying, but you know she always means it to be good. Anyways, I guess nothing really was bothering me in particular that day, other than the fact that I was running late to school. But, to make this story more interesting, I am going to tell it, excuse me, my story in 3rd person. Jenny slept quietly, sprawled out on the twin sized bed in the far left corner of the room. She was having a dream about flying, you know, the one every kid has. She was enjoying the smell of the air, the wind hitting her face, the sun on her..... BEEP, BEEP! ""Danny. Danny! DANNY!

It wasn""t a case because they had shared that for thirteen years and it was as easy breathing. Moonlight flitted through the blinds and the room was almost black, toffee eyes shimmering with moisture. ""Liv?"" he asked swallowing the lump in his throat. ""I want a baby"" The fear that festered began to dissipate and he reached a finger out to brush the lock of her hair behind her ear, ""Yeah?"" ""Yeah"" Nodding he propped himself up on an elbow and stared. Sometimes it was overwhelming, being together. Because every emotion was amplified ten- fold and the pain, hunger, happiness, ache, were like nothing else ever experienced. ""I didn""t know how much I did...and I know that you have your kids..."" Reaching out, his hand came to her taut abdomen, ""I want you to have my daughter"" ""Olivia!"" The ride to the hospital had been surreal and if it wasn""t instinctual she couldn""t have explained how she got there because every moment feels like being trapped underwater, choking, fighting, praying. Maureen""s voice called out for her as soon as the emergency room""s doors opened and in an instant the woman in front of her seemed so young, scared, ""I""m sorry I didn""t know who else to call"" she explained trembling.

""I know that,"" he smiled slightly and struggled to a sitting position. ""I also know that I was with Layla, so you can skip right to the part where she slapped me. What did I do this time?"" He had met Layla a year or so ago in another small town in the middle of the desert. They had just defeated a particularly vicious army sent by Saladin, so King Richard had suggested they celebrated. Robin, as per usual, had volunteered himself to stay behind and keep watch, but since he had played a vital part in their victory the King would not hear of it. As Crusaders they could hardly parade around a town they had just claimed as their own as if they were in London, but there were a few places they could go where the colour of the skin didn""t matter -so long as their purses were full. It was there that the two of them had met. Layla had taken a liking to him immediately. As someone who was used to men looking at her all the time, she had felt curiosity for the man who didn""t look at her at all. Robin, in turn, had had his vanity flattered when she made her move and he couldn""t resist her for long. Once upon a time he could have charmed any woman he wanted to -there wasn""t one girl in Nottingham who wouldn""t have had him if he had asked-, so to be the one being pursued was a nice change of pace. Also, it had been years since he had had any contact

Which is: there""s something going on that I don""t have a frelling clue about.' Aeryn went on ignoring him; Crais shifted slightly, observing Crichton""s increasing unease with fascination.

""Well, you""d think I""d be kind of used to that situation by now, right, guys? But, you know, for some reason, with you around, it makes me kind of nervous.' As he spoke, Crichton strolled towards Crais and leaned his face in close, breathing right in his ear, a half smile on his lips. Aeryn watched him; watched the exaggerated swagger in his movements, the cocky look on his face. Every time, he was like this. Never with D""Argo. Certainly never with Rygel.

She held her breath and moved closer, wondering if it would fly. With a flurry too quick for a child to see, the ladybug took to the air. The girl missed the flight, not only because of the speed, but because dusk had fallen. She frowned, then stomped her feet. Darkness had come early because of the stupid clouds. The sky wasn""t supposed to do this. She stomped again. She scrunched her face. She produced real tears - tears of rage. It wasn""t fair. The clouds responded. They parted, creating a hole for the light of the setting sun. The rage evaporated, and the child happily went back to the spot where the ladybug had been.

Girls were cute when they danced in a town square on feast days, useful when they provided supplies and horse management tips, and generally ignorable besides that. ""And your clumsiness is worth our other cart?"" ""I""m not clumsy,"" Daniel said. On ""clumsy,"" the cart horse whumped him in the small of the back and he fell knees forward, soiling the entire length of his trousers, front and back. ""Nice one, boy,"" Darrin said.

He envisioned the splinters of the useless cart knitting themselves back together, magically filling with horse manure, and slowly emptying over Darrin""s head. A handful of mud thumped against Daniel""s back. Daniel turned. Slipping and sliding, he covered the distance between himself and his older brother. Instead of attempting to gain proper footing to attack, he just grabbed his brother""s shoulders. They tumbled into the gutter. Twenty minutes later, Daniel addressed a large pile of mud with blue eyes. ""Um, I think the rain is stopping.

Hoarse laughter left Sora""s lips as he begged his boyfriend to stop, pushing at his biceps but to no avail. ""Jesus-Axel, please! Uncle, uncle!"" Axel sat up, giving Sora a chance to breathe, smiling down at the brunet happily. Blue eyes stared over Axel""s shoulders at the wall over his desk, where a group of photos hung taped to the wall. He stood, walking over to them. ""Are these your parents?"" he asked, tracing a finger on one of them. Axel seemed to be about ten, and Kairi was still a young toddler.

64,"Text1: 2nd Lament, 766AF In the darkness of the earth beneath the Circle of Tempest, there lies a great labyrinth known as the Inferno Line. At the dawn of the demon race, beneath the cruel taskmasters of the First Fallen, untold millions of demonic slaves worked to bore into the existing tunnels and caverns below the screaming mountains that encircled the Pit like a set of stone jaws. Fortresses were quarried into the very mountains, bunkers sunk deep into their roots, arsenals concealed beneath miles of bedrock, defensive fortifications erected amidst the sheer peaks and eternal storms above... and connecting it all, untold miles of tunnels and passageways. The Inferno Line guards the Pit from external attack; those who would invade Hell itself must not only cross the deserts of Emptiness, but fight through an intricate web of fortresses and gates that seals all but the most minor and obscure passes through the mountains of Tempest. When the demons slew the First Fallen and took Hell as their own world, the unified defense of the Inferno Line fell into disarray, leaving the fortresses to be seized and held by any and every group with the power to do so. While the most prominent fortresses and gates have been seized by the Houses, there are countless others, both on the surface and carved out of the twisting maze below, that lie in the possession of other entities. Independent demon warlords of all stripes, from mercenary bands to cells of Free City Heretics, make up the majority, but there are humans here too - faustians who relish the isolation, cells of escaped slaves (the Branded, as they call themselves) who cower amidst demon-crafted defenses, tribes of Hell-born mortals (the Early) who know nothing else save the cold and dark and the endless fighting

67,"Text1: The weak screams coming from Chris were all I needed to tell me my answer. Using every last bit of strength, I push forward, tearing my shoulder free from its captivity and falling face first against the cold metal underneath me. The extreme pain causes my vision to go temporarily black, my mind whirling and unconsciousness inches away from encompassing me. The world around me has gone quiet, sounds fading in and out like a weak radio station, save the metallic click that echoes hauntingly in front of me. I give a weak glance forward, seeing the silver outline in the darkness. It""s the enhanced c-virus. A million thoughts run through my head as Chris gives off another weak cry, his strength depleting rapidly. It won""t be long now, he""ll be dead soon-crushed under the pressure of HAOS"" grip. My gun is useless; the bullets won""t even phase this demon. If I don""t act fast, I""ll die from blood loss but, worse yet, Chris will die too. He""ll die because of me, because he tried to save me from death-like I said, irony. He""s always been like that, so self-sacrificing, and now it""s going to be his end; very, very soon...Unless I use it. My vision blurs as I look forward, seeing the thin line of silver sitting there, watching and waiting. Reaching forward, I pull my dying body-broken, beaten, bleeding-towards the small object. A hot sting pricks at my eyes but I ignore it; I can""t think about it now. I""m dying, there""s no hope left for me. Soon, I""ll be a worthless sack of skin lying on the cold metal, eyes glazed over and looking at the beast that will crush my captain.

Text2: Kensi raises a finger to his lips to silence him, as she begins running her hands carefully down his rugged musculature heading southward. The whole way she traces a line of gentle kisses down his chest, over his chiseled abs, and eventually reaches the part of his anatomy she is most interested in. Deeks closes his eyes, tilting his head back slightly, as Kensi playfully teases him. ""Oh, Fern."" He groans in a quiet voice. Kensi finally stops working him with her hand, having fully aroused him at this point, and moves on to something she knows he""ll find a little more satisfying. She flicks the tip with her tongue, and playfully nips at it all around as a steady stream of warm water flows over them from the showerhead. She raises her eyes to him, a mischievous look painted across her face, and is quite pleased with herself as she notices how the muscles in his face and neck are all tensed in response to her playfulness. She then turns her attention back to her previous work. She places several gentle kisses around his tip before finally taking him completely into her mouth. ""Aaah...Mmmm...Oh, Geez, baby-that feels good."" He groans out in a thick, husky voice as Kensi continues to pleasure him. He tangles one hand in her long, dark locks and seems to hold her in place right where she""s at. ""Mmmmm...Oh, Aaaah...Yeah, that""s my girl."" He groans out, as Kensi begins to increase her pace. He knows he won""t last much longer like this, and if he wants any chance at sharing his already imminent release with her-he""ll have to stop her quickly.

Text2: Chapter 1: Simple, Yet Complicated As I sat in the cramped quarters of the transport plane, I could only think about one thing: the mission. It was simple, really. The General said to just ""Find and eliminate the enemy."" Yet, many complications could arise from it. All those scenarios of what could go wrong that were running through my mind were interrupted when the pilot over the speaker said ""5 minutes."" I immediately snapped out of my daydream, and scrambled to ready my gear. I made last minute checks on everything, including my parachute. Satisfied that everything was in order, I stood near the doorway. ""1 minute!"" That was my cue to open the door. After doing so, I felt the air rush in, but I was able to breathe easily because of the oxygen mask. The plane I""m in was so high up in the air that anyone on the ground would just think that this plane was just another commercial air liner. I didn""t wait for the pilot""s last words. I was counting down since his last announcement, and promptly jumped out of the plane just before the pilot could say anything. All I could see was the clouds going through me, then suddenly, I saw the mass expansion of green vegetation below me. ""Welcome to Japan, soldier!"" I muttered under the mask. ""Please fasten your seatbelts to ensure a comfortable ride! Since you are doing a HALO insertion, don""t forget to pull the harness of your parachute just before you land, or you""ll go out with a splat, not a bang!""

Text2: Kagome watched in horror as Shippo slowly slid down and lay motionless on the ground ""no! Shippo!"" she cried out and suddenly it felt like something broke inside of her and she was surrounded by a black light. She dropped to all fours and began to change. Black fur sprouted along her body and her hands became large paws with deadly claws, her head elongated to form a panther""s head and a tail sprouted from the base of her spine. Her teeth became deadly sharp fangs and an emerald five-point star appeared on her forehead and she grew to a size a little bigger than Sesshomaru. With a roar, her transformation was complete and she leapt at the snake demon with claws and fangs bare. The snake demon could tell it was in trouble and tried to run but the newly-transformed Kagome easily caught it and sank her fangs into it""s neck, it struggled for a few minutes before going limp in death.

""I simply want to talk. There""s nothing wrong with that, is there?"" ""That depends on what you want to talk about."" Nimueh cocked her head, a thoughtful look flickering onto her face.

Text2: He ensured Sherlock""s permission to stay with John before leaving. Moriarty was on his way to a secure location in the depths of the British countryside, and Mycroft intended to be there for when he arrived. On top of that the leak in their security had been far too big and far too dangerous for him to let slide. He stepped into the sleek, black car waiting for him outside the hospital and put his brother out of his mind. He returned two days later. According to Lestrade, Sherlock had not left the hospital and did not look as if he planned to any time soon. Mycroft found him in the small, private room John had been moved to. His little brother was slouched in a straight-backed chair beside the bed, his knees hugged against his chest, his face sprinkled with stubble and his eyes slightly glazed. Mycroft read John""s chart. No infection. Puncture to lungs to be checked every few hours and dressing changed daily. Tube to be removed soon. Patient currently in a drug induced coma. Unknown drug had not been identified as of yet, although it was now out of his system. Mycroft flipped through the pages, then replaced the chart and glanced at Sherlock. ""Good news, then."" Sherlock""s eyebrow twitched. ""Well, now that we""re out of the woods, how about returning to some basic human hygiene routines?"" Sherlock turned a glare on Mycroft, his jaw clenching. ""It""s hardly as if I care what these chemistry students think of me,"" he said. ""I see no reason for you to stay.""

I got up as quickly as I could, wincing as I ran out to check on Zuko who was lying on the ground. ""Zuko? Are you okay?"" I asked, checking him over. He didn""t look too hurt. ""Serenity?"" I looked up, and saw Katara and Sokka staring at me shocked. ""Katara!"" I smiled then remembered something. ""Aang""s in trouble! He""s in there!"" I said gesturing to the building I noticed Azula go into. Katara nodded and ran off, as Sokka glared at me. ""Oh what, no hello for me?"" I rolled my eyes and looked back down at Zuko, as Sokka ran off to help Katara. Suddenly she ran out of the building, Azula right behind her. Sokka however came out of a door and tried to attack Azula, who dodged, and backed up as Aang, Katara, and Sokka cornered her. A shadow loomed over me and Zuko, and I looked up just as Zuko opened his eyes, and smiled. It was Iroh! ""Uncle..."" Zuko said quietly, just as shocked as I was. ""Get up!"" Iroh said, as Zuko took his hand and sat up. He looked over at me, and we both smiled at each other. I stood up and looked over to see the other four in a 3 on 1 battle. That is until Azula fell to the ground, and standing behind her was a young girl, with black hair, who was wearing an Earth Kingdom outfit. ""I thought you guys could use some help."" She said.

He was fighting the heartless like it was nothing! The Invisible-which had been incredibly hard for Lexi to even scratch-was easily being overpowered by the silver-haired boy. Finally, after a few more minutes of Riku attacking and dodging the Invisible, he ducked to avoid an attack, then jumped up and sliced through the heartless"" head, landing swiftly on the ground as the heartless disappeared. Lexi watched the giant heart come out of it and float up and disappear, going into Kingdom Hearts. Well, that would be a significant help. That heart was huge, so that meant Kingdom Hearts would be that much closer to being completed. ""Are you sure you""re okay?"" Lexi looked over to see Riku standing in front of her. She had been so caught up in the fight and watching the heart, she hadn""t seen him come over. ""Oh...yes. I""m fine."" She said smiling. She was very grateful Riku had come and saved her.

Her hair was a similar shade of the color, cut to just above her shoulders, and she wore a kind smile as she stood there. ""Who""re you?"" Asuka asked roughly, looking thoroughly unimpressed. ""Good evening,"" the girl said, giving a slight bow. ""My name is Karasu. Is this the apartment of Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley?"" ""You""ve found the right place,"" Asuka said grudgingly.

A quick word about the various Links and their place in the timeline- based on Hyrule Historia, I""ve come to the conclusion it works like this: Skyward Sword is the first Link, followed by the Link from the Minish Cap, who is the same Link from the first Four Swords game. Up next is Ocarina of Time, with the next Link, who carries over into the first game on the timeline where Ganondorf was stopped before he could actually commit any crimes, namely, Majora""s Mask. After Majora comes Twilight Princess, and another Link, and afterwards comes yet another new Link in Four Swords Adventures. On the timeline where Ganondorf took over, then was stopped, we have Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass (same Link) followed by Spirit Tracks (new Link.) As for the timeline where the Hero of Time died prematurely, we have Link to the Past, the Oracle games, and Link""s Awakening, all of which feature the same Link, followed by a new Link with Link Between Worlds, and finally, the very first Link in the very first two games, who, incidentally, is featuring in this first real chapter! Also incidentally, Adventure of Link, the second game, is one of two that I""ve never finished- I just can""t play it to save my life, can""t even get to the second dungeon.

He growled at himself, taking himself and his water bottle over to the couch instead, laying back on it with a soft ""oof!"" as he fell back listlessly. The situation was kind of crazy really. Well, really crazy. Silver bit his lip as he considered it. He had been trying to block it from his mind since then... but it wasn""t really working. He""d let his guard down in his match earlier today with Gold because of it. It was affecting his skills as a trainer. His Pokémon were getting hurt because of it.

He""d gone to challenge the other teen, just to a little practice battle.

He knew that she would turn up soon enough. And, as sure as sunrise, she did. Sherlock grabbed her and covered her mouth with his gloved hand immediately so that she would not scream.

I""m still alive and well, and yes I""m continuing this, yesterday morning I received a review and it made me realize I had an update lying around, but never put it up. Why you might ask? Well that""s a long and personal story, but for those who wanted to know I wrote it beneath this chapter. I also managed to remove some mistakes from my previous chapters. Enjoy! Mary had prohibited Sherlock from coming anywhere near Molly the entire evening. He had tried to corner her thrice more, but Mary had apparently taken up the role of her protector for this evening and guarded Molly from him in every way, much to his annoyance. He had retreated onto a barstool observing the others, after shooting arrows with bows. At which he had caught Molly professionally shooting an arrow right into the middle after making sure no one would see her. She""d been fumbling with the first two arrows, obviously trying to hide her skills in handling them.

96,"Text1: By Nightsong Setzer Gabbiani walked down the busy hallway with an unconcerned ease, gloved hands pushed in the pockets of his long black jacket. His eyes briefly played over each of the passing Imperial soldiers, more out of habit than any interest or concern. It had been a long time since he""d last been to Vector, and even longer since his last trip to the Imperial Palace. Had Setzer cared to reflect on it for a moment, he would have noted that he hadn""t missed the place much. The smell of oil and smoke seemed to permeate everything in this city, and the perfumes and red-carpeted floors of the palace hardly masked that. His feet clacked sharply to a stop - the rugs scarcely masked the impact of feet against the metal floors - as he stepped up to a guard standing alongside one of the palace""s many doors. ""I""m here to see General Leo."" He said simply, strands of his white hair falling in his face as he cocked his head to regard the soldier. The guard shouldered his rifle and looked Setzer over. ""You have an appointment?"" Rolling his eyes, Setzer pulled a piece of paper from his pocket bearing the Imperial Seal. ""You think?"" The Imperial glanced briefly at the document - a useless gesture, as Setzer""d had to show his papers to get into the palace in the first place - and stepped aside, his interest in the matter apparently lost. The white-haired man smoothed out the folds of his jacket for a brief moment, then smoothly stepped past the man and opened the door that led to Leo""s office. What greeted him on the other side was a very spartan affair when compared to most of the overly-ornate palace. A rich, wine-colored carpet was laid

The more I had of him, the more I wanted, and we kissed each other passionately until I was panting for breath. My need for him only continued to intensify as he opened himself up to me and I allowed myself a sigh and then a moan as he kissed his way down my throat. I savored the cool touch of his hands and mouth on me as he worked his way down to my chest, kissing my breasts with a tender, but needy touch. ""Jesus, Jasper..."" I moaned. ""You feel so good."" Untangling my hands from his soft hair, I traced down his chest and abs to the waist of his pants. I wasn""t sure what I was doing; this was uncharted territory for me, and I wasn""t sure he would let me get this far, but I needed him like air or food.

""I don""t know if this is a good idea. I""m not sure if I can... I don""t want to lose control with you."" ""Jasper,"" I assured him.

Even though that she had never had a mother over the rest of her childhood and teenage years, she was always the best shape because of her father, the brilliant scientist, Harrison Wells, took care of her. What can she say? She had the best father in the world. She could also recall that time when she got lost in the planetarium, his father locked down the whole place in a snap, just to find her. She had top marks when she was at school, always on the Top 1 place. She always gets her day done fast enough so she could rest. Her whole life, she was quick. People could even call her an illusion because of how quick she can get things done quickly. She graduated with 5 majors in college, which is on Earth-1, not common anywhere. Not just to Central City, but everywhere. She was always supportive of her father when she watches him do press conferences, announcements, even in interviews. But one day, she was taken by the terrorist of Central City, Zoom. She was not very quick. Then she got rescued months later and traveled to Earth-1 and met up with The Flash.

However, Pascal came along and he bit at the edge of Gothel""s edge, trying to pull Gothel away from Rapunzel. Annoyed, Gothel kicked Pascal away. ""Rapunzel, really!"" Gothel exclaimed, irritated.

A thunk was heard, earning a gasp from Callie as she twirled around to stare at the arrow that was on the tree which was beside her. She then looked at Pan who gave a mere shrug. But what caught her interest was that he was twirling the Bow. ""Were you trying to kill me?"" Callie shouted. ""Nope.

Swallowing thickly, her mouth dried, lips parting slightly as she drank him down - damp, tawny waves framing his face carelessly, worn, ratty jeans slung low on his hips and seeming yards of pale, toned flesh glistening in the low light.

It was like he had a big giant green rage monster as his guardian angel... great. Tony had deemed the whole situation weird but if that meant Clint had a decreased likelihood of being shot then no one was really complaining.

Text2: Which is why it baffled so many people when they learned that Grantaire was in one of the top student run organizations on campus for social justice, Les Amis, notorious for forming large protests on the diag. Les Amis seemed like a strange extra circular to devote so much time and effort into for a guy who hated protests. The answer was simple. He was there for Enjolras and the only reason he was at that godforsaken protest was for Enjolras. Enjolras had the Les Amis standing in the front of the crowd, showing support for whatever the hell the guy on the stage was yammering about. Grantaire casted a sideways glance over. Enjolras was frowning and clearly unimpressed by what he was hearing. His dirty blond curls were shielding his critical blue eyes as they examined the protest signs and the presentation. The whole image was poorly executed, the speakers were more aggressive than persuasive, and the signs looked like they had been thrown together last minute. It must have been driving Enjolras crazy to have to see such a shit show and do absolutely nothing about it. Sure enough, Enjolras was muttering something to Marius and pointing towards the banner. Grantaire blew a long impatient breath from between his teeth and shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans. He turned his attention to the large metal stage that creaked and groaned every step Daniel, the speaker, took. That was another thing. Enjolras never moved without a purpose. When he spoke he stood rooted in one spot and when he would switch directions, which was rare, there was always a point to his movement that made it fluid. Daniel was sporadic and practically twitching like he didn""t know what to do with his body. Enjolras for his","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""I""ll come back to you...is it all right?"" she asked with her tone ever so sweet to which, all he did was nod. After a few moments, she finally got back to him and apologized for her sudden leave. ""You were saying?"" she asked once more, referring of course to the one Kira was trying to relay to her earlier. ""Yes, as I was saying...do you want to-,"" ""Hey Lacus, don""t forget! On the 14, we""ll go to the charity school! Okay?"" the same girl shouted once more. ""Sure..."" Lacus replied, more calmly and refined than her loud friend""s. This new-found information really surprised Kira. As Lacus once again shifted her attention to the one before her, she found him looking blankly somewhere, shock evident on his face. ""Kira, are you all right?"" she inquired, worry on her face. As if her voice woke him up from the sudden ""revelation"", he simply nodded his head and cheerfully exclaimed he was feeling mighty well. This somehow made Lacus feel better, she originally thought the change in Kira""s mood was because of her or something she said. ""Charity school...on Valentine""s...now that""s...sweet...of you, I mean."" Kira finally said, still reluctant and unbelieving as to how the things turned out. ""Yeah, don""t you think so?"" somehow, this response from Kira enthused her and even brought an unusual glow in her. ""Sure thing. I mean, Valentine""s is love, and charity is love. They""re the same thing..."" ""You really think so? That""s...unbelievable. You""re the first one to ever say that."" ""Say what?"" ""That Charity school is sweet and that it""s actually fitting for Valentine""s. Thank you for

I stared past him, my eyes wandering into another place, far from here. There""s a meadow, located in a forest not too far from here. The sun is shining, the weather warm. It""s a meadow of color, bursts of vibrant light and flowers. It""s beautiful. My eyes fluttered as the vision changed. Two figures, both sitting not too far from each other, one sparkling with small shapes of diamonds over his skin. I focused closer, recognizing the faces. Edward. Bella Swan. ""Alice, what is it?"" Edward muttered, realizing what was happening. ""What are you seeing?"" Shh, I said quietly in my mind, trying to concentrate on the scene that was playing across my golden eyes like titles on a movie screen. I looked up at Edward. ""Bella,"" I muttered. ""Swan?"" he asked questioningly. I sighed in frustration. Who else? Of course Bella Swan. ""What happened?"" Everything is okay. I saw you two in a meadow.

She said holding out her hand. Chibs shook it ""I""m Chibs."" He said. Lonnie liked his accent. Juice opened the door in his jeans. ""What is it?"" he asked annoyed until he looked at Lonnie leaning on the door frame. ""You got a guest."" Chibs informed him before walking away.

Juice pulled her in, Lonnie quickly put the cake on the closet flat surface as his lips crushed hers. Juice was guiding her to his bed but she pulled away. ""No!

Juice sat down on the bed as he watched Lonnie kick off her shoes retrieving the cake and taking two forks out of her purse. ""Why would you wanna do that?"" Juice inquired. Lonnie looked at him with a confused look on her face as she took a seat on the bed. She sat the red velvet cake between them passing him the fork. ""Tonight was a lot of fun.

He walked around to look at his girl from the front. Her vampire face was on; she was rocking slowly on her heels as she chanted quietly. Bare feet were stained with blood as she stood in the circle Tracy painted earlier. A beautifully designed Egyptian bowl lay next to her right foot. Damon started to pace watching Bonnie intently.

It made the whole thing seem real. Those screams would ring in the silence later that night. The pumpkin kid wasn""t the first one that had died by these blood soaked hands, but his murder was one of the most fun.

No one else was harmed - we think it was a simple robbery gone wrong."" He tried to smile. ""You probably put your assailants to flight before they could take anything from you. ""Then why do I not remember?"" Enjolras asked, eyes wide, his look half angry. ""We don""t know. Did you by any chance have anything to eat or drink before you met us at the Café before the theatre? Anything that might have tasted bitter or unusual?"" Being able to recall this seemed to make Enjolras calmer. ""I had a meal at midday, or somewhat after - bread, cheese. Some water. But I had eaten the same the previous evening, and had no ill effects then. Do you think it was drugged?

My initial reaction was that Dad had grown a third leg on the front of his body, but reality checked in with my brain and he realized what it was. The bulge in his briefs was full. And thick. My knowledge of male sex organs was limited to what I had seen in porn, but this was actually a step above. And if I had to guess, the morning-wood syndrome was keeping it at a nice full throb. ""You""re not, uh... wearing pants,"" was my less than intelligible way to address the situation. ""Hey Ichigo!"" Dad laughed and looked down. ""Ah! Right. Forgot about that."" But instead of correcting the situation, he just continued to stroll towards the kitchen.

Or at least I thought I did. Surprise?"" He laughed again, then noticed my attention. ""Ha! Right. Old morning wood is going strong. Sorry for that imagery."" ""Yeah, it is!"" I exclaimed. The next part I wish I could have held back, but my mind was wonderful at ruining situations. ""It""s fucking huge!"" ""Ah, is it?"" Dad was so casual about this it was infuriating.

She tried to close the top hurriedly, but she was so nervous that she couldn""t seem to grab it, and the movement just made her giant tits jiggle more seductively. ""Oh, I""m so sorry! I should have worn better clothes, I... oh, Sky! Oh my Lord!"" Sky watched Diaspro""s lips and eyes open wide with amazement. Then he saw what she was staring at. The towel had slid completely off of his hips, actually pushed aside by the sudden, dramatic stiffening of his extremely large cock. Diaspro stared in wonder at the gigantically long, fat hard-on now standing stiffly, his fuck-shaft twitching obscenely over his belly, his balls bloated with cum. It stood 12 inches long and thicker than a soda can. It was almost twice as big as the largest size she ever had. Looking at her naked body had given him the biggest hard-on she""d ever seen in her life. Compared to her fiancee""s 6 inches, it was a whole new world. ""Good Lord, Sky!"" Diaspro whispered breathlessly. ""It""s simply huge!"" Moaning with embarrassment, Sky tried to cover his huge cock with his hands and started to roll onto his stomach. But he couldn""t.

They took their time talking to each other. Well, they were mostly coming up with insults for each other, but still. Lovino enjoyed the company, as much as he hated to admit it. They even talked about themselves. Well, Lovino left out a lot of details unlike Gilbert, but said his favorite foods and what he likes to do in his free time. Those sorts of things. Lovino wanted to hit himself for being disappointed when they finally arrived at the gym. ""Here it is."" Gilbert informed in front of the big fire-proof doors. ""Really? I never would have guessed from the sign that said ""GYM"" on it."" Lovino said mostly just trying to find a way to insult the German once again. ""Right this way, prinzessin."" Gilbert said with his stupid grin that Lovino hated, for the second time that day, mind you. The two walked into the gym. It was nothing special. Couple pieces of equipment here and there, pull out bleaches, basketball hoops. The stuff you""d expect in a Gym class. The biggest thing that Lovino noticed was that no one was actually doing anything. Groups of people were just talk and hanging out. Gilbert noticed this as well and made comments about the students being ""Lazy free loaders"" and ""How much harder my gym class is because I""m so awesome that I""m in the special class"". Gilbert continued to guide Lovino through the gym. As they walked through, eyes darted to Lovino, who slowly slid behind Gilbert trying to cover himself.

She looked up at him her face streaked with tears and utterly miserable. ""Mommy""s gone"" she said her voice muffled with tears, McCoy looked at her he had nothing to say that would make it better, instead he scooped up the crying girl, and held her, one hand twined in her hair, as she cried into his shoulder, the other staring at the ring in his hand, it was cold with the feeling of betrayal. The memory of that day still lingered. McCoy pulled himself off the couch, where he had sprawled last night after drinking nearly half a bottle of whiskey. At the moment he wanted nothing more than to stay there for several more hours, but his body cried out for what he had gotten use to: alcohol. A few months ago he would have felt a lot worse from imbibing such a large quantity of alcohol; now his body had gotten use to the punishment, all he had was a headache

Arthur opened and closed his mouth like a fish, then carried on when he had thought of something to say. ""No, I mean yes. I would depend. Look, why did you hide?"" As ever, a prat. Stupid question to ask. However, Merlin had a better answer than ""because my head would be cut off and my body burned"". ""Hide? Hide! I never hid! All I did was put my neckerchief on to cover my bite mark and that was it! You were just too big headed to notice that I was different!"" Merlin shouted, hands in the air.

She gave one bottle of milk to baby Poseidon and took Baby Athena and sat on the other sofa with another bottle of milk. We waited about three more minutes and mom began to stir. I had been going through what I""m going to say but all I managed to say was, ""Hey mom"" when she stared at me. She blinked her eyes then stared at Annabeth who was bottle-feeding baby Athena on her lap. ""Mrs. Jackson it""s..."" Annabeth began but mom immediately cut her off. ""Oh my god!"" mom shrieked then turned to me. ""You Perseus! How could you!"" her eyes were seriously twitching by then as she pointed at me. ""How could you not tell me that you two already have a baby?"" she exclaimed. And for her to use my real name means she""s serious and pissed. ""Mom... it""s not..."" I interrupted but she was on a roll and she spoke like a machine gun. ""Don""t lie to me!"" she snapped then looked at baby Poseidon. ""And twins it seems! I mean, look at him... he just looks exactly like you."" She said and pointed to Baby Poseidon. ""And her..."" she started and pointed to baby Athena... the goddess of wisdom let out an ""Eeek!"" again. ""She""s like a carbon copy of Annabeth!"" To tell you the truth... I felt like laughing so hard. I just couldn""t take mom seriously with her looking like that... circles on her eyes and an X on her nose... it was just so funny. She looked like a panda! ""When did you give birth?"" she asked Annabeth.

""Hey, Sam. It""s good to see you too."" ""Ruby."" He caught the computer and set it down, carefully disentangled Dean from his side, and gently propped him with the pillows, made sure he was as comfortable as he could get him in this type of situation, before turning his full attention to her.

""Leave me alone!"" Casey replied, and she was just about to hang up, when the voice asked that dreaded question; ""Have you checked the children?"" Casey was alarmed. She immediately shot out of her seat and rushed out of her room and towards Lizzie""s. She stopped in front of the door for a second, before she placed a hand on the handle and gently pushed down; pushed the door open. She peeked inside, afraid of what she would see, but she found everything as it was supposed to be. Confused, she closed the door and went down the hall to check on Edwin and Marti too. She found everything okay in there as well and started walking back to her room, lifting her cell to her ear again; ""I""ve checked on the kids, you freak, and everything is as it""s supposed to!"" she snapped at him. She felt a little tense, but that was understandable. There was no response on the other line, so Casey hung up with a sigh. She stopped outside her room, when the sound of laughter hit her ears. She groaned inwardly at how stupid she had been and quickly stomped down the stairs; hitting Derek on the back of his head when she reached him; ""De-REK!"" she yelled, ""That wasn""t funny!"" He laughed again and turned around to look at her, ""Oh, but I thought it was."" He said, that joyous look on his face he always got when he did something to

Alice laughed at her and turned onto her back again, staring straight into the ceiling; she""d been wondering about that too, about the question of gay and straight, and women and men. It was confusing, but it was a subject she couldn""t keep away from, not after Helena had entered her life and trigged something within her. It would be so much easier... so much freer, to be with a woman. It""d relieve her from a lot of memories she didn""t want to think about, and it""d be different. She wouldn""t have to worry about Jasper, wouldn""t feel the need to compare him and the new guy, to put Jasper into the picture no matter what. If she was with a woman, she could start all over, and Jasper would always be a part of her memory, and part of her past, but it would be easier to move and try to live her life fully with the people she loves. ""...Alice?"" Rosalie, who had been quiet until now, letting Alice wallow in her thoughts, finally broke though her shell and awoke her. She was glancing down at her, a worried look in her hazel eyes, and Alice thought that she looked so beautiful. ""Are you ... gay?"" ""That""s the thing,"" Alice said and nudged her gently in the side with her knee, ""as from now on, I""m not really sure."" I apologise for the delay and for the length of this chapter.

Bree felt the salt burn her fresh cuts, and she pressed her teeth to her bonds, trying to keep back the tears. Bree lay on the deck, rainwater soaking her bloodied back as she tried to sleep. She didn""t care if she died out here. Better to die than serve on this ship! But Bree found no rest. She was hauled up, and was whirled around. A half man half shark gripped her, grinning at her. He called out, ""Cap""n! She""s still alive!"" Jones came over, his broadsword back in its sheath, ""I should hope so."" He looked closely at Bree. His eyes rested on a medallion hanging about her neck. He motioned towards it, asking, ""What is that, missy?"" Bree gripped the medallion, hissing, ""Nothin""!"" Jones smiled cruelly. He reached forward, took hold of the medallion and ripped it from Bree""s neck. Bree gave out a cry, lunging forward, but the shark creature yanked her back. Bree began pleading with her new captain, ""Please! That was my mother""s! It""s all I have left of her!"" Jones fingered the medallion, inspecting it. He grinned, tucking it into his shirt, saying, ""I might as well take it off yer hands. Ye won""t need it."" Bree felt tears budding in her eyes. She growled angrily, ""I swear I""ll kill ye!"" Jones laughed hard, and those within earshot laughed as well. No one had ever been so defiant, but Bree stood no chance against Davy Jones. Jones then thought

Fumika jumped into the conversation in excitement. ""What kind of rumor is that?-!"" Konoka had licked her lips and smiled. So it had begun, huh? ""Yeah, tell us more!"" It also helped that Konoka had been fascinated by the occult before, and this was no secret to the class. ""Don""t you guys know?

He whistled softly and patted a beat onto his legs as he waited for Cameron to return. She came out five minutes later, carrying a glass of orange juice for herself and a bottle of beer for him. ""Thanks,"" Wilson said as he clinked his bottle to her glass jokingly. Cameron nodded and laughed, sipping from her beverage periodically as she stared over at the crib like a hawk. Wilson followed her intense look and relaxed a grin on his boyishly handsome face. ""He""s not going to sneak out in the middle of the night you know...not yet anyway,"" he joked to Cameron, earning a blushing beam from her. ""I know... I just get worried is all."" She responded, comfortable with the small talk. Wilson nodded in understanding and sipped from his beer before looking around and asking, ""House?""

""I may have made him sterile Bobby...Jesus!"" Sighing in both of their sorrow, he gently embraced her for the first time. It was their first hug that either could remember in their partnership, and it was inside the hallway of a hospital, where their fellow officer lie wounded.

She was kind of tall for a woman like her and Sasuke noticed that her hitai-ate had a symbol that he had never seen before. There was a look of sorrow in her eyes and pain on her face. She quickly erased the expression with a grin. ""Listen, brat,"" the woman said, pointing at his chest, ""I need to know about Naruto. How is he?"" Sasuke was puzzled. ""Nani? Why?"" The woman rolled her eyes. ""Just interested. I just knew his father."" Sasuke raised an eyebrow. He had never thought of Naruto""s parents before. Who were they? ""Who was his father?""

Her feeding slowed as she waited in anticipation of his bite, wondering how it would feel now that her senses were heightened. When his fangs sank into her neck, Caroline assumed it would have been painful at first, but the slow piercing of her skin had felt peaceful and erotic all at the same time. The rush of desire had her fangs lengthening even further inside of his skin even as she sucked harder, the pull of his blood the most exquisite thing she""d ever tasted. It should have felt odd, feeling him drink from her as she did the same to him, but it felt deeply intimate, even more intimate than the sex they""d shared several days before. Klaus gripped her tightly to him, his breathing almost as labored as her own as her desire began to heighten along with his own. It was almost as if they""d connected on another level entirely, almost as if they were one being, one entity that picked up where the other left off. It was alluring and alarming all at once and extremely personal. All too soon Caroline broke away, sighing whenever Klaus stopped feeding almost immediately afterward.

Then he held out a small box to me, unwrapped. I took it gingerly from his hands and lifted the lid of the jewelry box. Inside was simple silver chain with a ring on it. The ring was a skinny gold band with a pretty pear-cut amethyst stone. The gold band had intricately carved designs in the side and when I looked inside, the word Forever was engraved in it.

She jumped up and moved to strike again and I dodged out of the way. Her crew began to cheer her on as she lunged at me again and this time, as I protected my front, she kicked my side.

He was given a black mask to place over his eyes if he wanted and the attendant left him to his mud. He settled into it nicely and placed the mask over his face.

Laney was sitting with Georgia at a small wooden table. Georgia raised her eyebrow and stared at the panting Cam. Laney asked Georgia to give them a minute, so Georgia stepped outside.

""Oh, um sorry.. That is so unlike me.."" Laney stepped back and turned her attention the floor. ""Uhm, I""m gonna go to my room.."" Cam sighed and headed towards his rented room. He suddenly felt awkward being there, which had never happened before. Cam was completely lost and uncomfortable in this situation. He simply went into his room, trying to forget everything.

""Hey there, little sis! I didn""t know you were still in town,"" he stated, holding up her arms to get a better look at her. Special Agent Christiansen was a tall man at the age of thirty-four, with a mess of blonde curls that swept down passed his ears and a wicked gleam in his eye that Emma was all too familiar with. All in all he didn""t look a thing like what you might imagine should come from an agent of the FBI, with his devil-may-care attitude and carefree demeanor. He was the epitome of contradictions. Well, he came in close second to her own raging contradiction, anyway.

It looked beautiful today. Very blue and calm. It looked like James was going to have the perfect day. I sat down and realised how quiet it was now. There was nobody around to talk to and my room was tucked so far away from anywhere that there could be noise. Although this was what I was used to, what I had grown up with, there was just something about it that didn""t seem right. The needle bit in to my skin and I inhaled sharply to stop myself saying anything regrettable. The pain brought with it a strange sense of déjà vu and I found that I wasn""t surprised when James entered the room. ""Isabelle?"" he said and I put down needle and thread. James was looking nervous, but I suppose he had every right to be. ""Yes, Commodore?"" I replied with a huge emphasis on the ""Commodore"".

It was as white as snow and she blended in well with her surroundings. She knew that she shouldn""t be where she was but she stayed anyway. She needed to know where the other cat was going. She kept on watching him until he sat down and stayed that way as if he felt her presence. The back of his fur rose as a ghostly gray cat drew nearer to him. The she- cat saw something that horrifed her. The big tom had leapt from his position and sent snow everywhere. She could hear a shocked meow and a screech that sounded as if one of the cats were in pain. The she cat darted from her position and leapt at the male cat that was attacking the gray cat. Suddenly she realized that it was her best friend, Ghostfur. Her sharp claws sank into the tom cats back. Her attack took him by surprise. He yowled and backed off from Ghostfur and tried desperately to get the cat on his back off. He suddenly fell backwards and the she cat was knocked out of breath. Her claws ripped out of his flesh and he growled. He turned to face his attacker. The she cat quickly closed her eyes so she would not be spotted. It worked! The male cat looked around and saw no cat in sight, only paw prints. Ghostfur had quickly dug a hole to hide in so she would not get spotted. The male cat tore through the snow dashing off towards Shadowclan territory. ""Are you all","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Now that is the end of Episode 18 as well as the end of Arc 2, but it is also the end of Season 1 of Lore Keepers! Now let me start by saying that I am terribly sorry for the over a month long delay. I originally had this done a while back, but due to someone who may or may not be related to me caused the file to get deleted causing me great frustration and having to write it yet again...yeah that was fun. I was also going between writing this and writing the Season 2 premiere episode so while I was spending time on this chapter I was also busy with the second season. I originally had Dr. O/Tommy Oliver much more involved...I think...in the previous version, but because of what happened I couldn""t replicate what I had. Now while Season 1 is over Lore Keepers is far from being over. The ending section is a taste of events to come in a different ranger story that will feature the Lore Keeper rangers teaming up with yet another OC ranger team. You will have to wait and see who. Also I do plan on writing more Interludes which will take place before, during, or after episodes. If you have suggestions for Interludes that you want to see happen just let me know via review or pm.

Scott was close to 10 years older, and therefore as much parent as brother to Alan when he was a child. It did make for an interesting family dichotomy. Because of the age difference between the two, they accounted for their own Tracy version of the generation gap.

What Alan failed to understand was that Scott had been a typical teenager. Yes, probably more responsible than most, as he was helping with the younger kids, but still typical. And in true Scott fashion, his exploits tended to be pretty outrageous. As inventive as Alan""s, were the truth to be told, just far, far fewer. So now, for the youngest Tracy to find out that his elder brother, the resented, and at the same time, much admired, ""Captain Tracy"" had normal, everyday faults always made his day, and as Alan grew older, that fact actually seemed to bring them closer together.

She picked up the last bite and finished it off, wiping her hands on the white undershirt she wore. She had gotten hungry earlier and tried to pick up something quick at a near by fast food place. The smell alone turned her stomach. She found a small sushi bar around the corner from her apartment and decided to become a frequent patron. A sign appeared on the screen, telling her the download was complete. She typed in a few commands and copied the files to her lap top. As they were traveling, she read through the police reports.

""Al, I""m not going to cave in! This is for your own good!"" It killed Edward to start with the whole ""you have to be cruel to be kind"" act. They were a double team, best friends, twins. Equals. His age did not mean that he suddenly had the right to boss his brother around, but then, to get his brother through the next few years alive, he had to abuse his power. He wanted to cry. But he would certainly not weep over such stupid things. Alphonse looked at his brother with sharp, accusing eyes. It would have looked like hatred if Edward didn""t know better, and saw the hurt and desperation there too. Alphonse tried another tactic. ""Well, if anything is selfish, I think that you only thinking about how this affects your own conscience is selfish!"" Of course, it didn""t work, his words held no meaning, and no logic. In the end, Edward had had enough and gripped Al""s shoulders tightly, forcing him to look into his older brother""s eyes.

Gamora came awake with a start, to see the smirking face of Korath the Pursuer. She made a grab for his throat, before she realised that she was chained, spread-eagled, to a wall. Heavy chains, too strong for even her to break. ""My, she really is a feisty one,"" said someone standing next to Korath. The Emperor. ""Tight-ass, I presume,"" she said. ""That""s Tarkus,"" he said.

They moored the boat at a landing and unloaded the horses. There was a road leading west from the damn, and they followed it.

I turned around in my seat to see Shikamaru""s father, and a girl a little younger than me walk into the room. The girl gasped and ran over to Shikamaru and sat down beside him, looking worriedly at his broken finger. ""Hi, Shizuka,"" Shikamaru muttered in a monotone. Shizuka Kobayashi was a girl who had moved to the Leaf village from the Moon village a while ago. I heard the story from the genin in Konaha: Apparently she was on Shikamaru""s team for a while, and they liked each other, and were now dating. I also heard that she was a mute, and communicated by writing her thoughts down on a piece of paper. I watched as Shizuka fretted over Shikamaru with envy filling my system. Fortunate girl, I thought. The boy you love has but a hurt finger. Mine might be dead. I gazed at the floor and tried to fight back the dread that washed over me. I glanced at the clock. I had been sitting here for three hours and I still hadn""t received any news about Neji. That bothered me. I watched as Shikamaru got up and left the two girls sitting, and he proceeded to walk out of the room when his father stopped him. I listened as his dad gave him hell about being a coward, which didn""t make very much sense to me, but then again, I wasn""t listening very closely to their previous discussion. Suddenly, Lady Tsunade walked into the room, announcing that Chouji was all right. I didn""t react to her words, for it was not Chouji I was worried about. Shortly afterwards, Shizune came running into the waiting room.

""One at a time,"" he said calmly, ""You are going to explain to me your grievances with each other and the other cannot speak. Not even sneeze. Bellamy, would like to go first?"" The next half an hour was filled with complaints, glares and the scribbling of Monty""s pen. He wasn""t sure if either of them noticed how much paper he was going through since they were busy controlling tempers. ""Well,"" he said finally, ""those are certainly...detailed problems you both have."" Clarke and Bellamy still sat apart with their arms folded. ""Look can we just get to the point?"" Clarke asked suddenly, ""I don""t think either of us would appreciate you dancing around the issue. Please, tell us the truth as clearly as possible and we will deal with it."" When he saw Bellamy nod, Monty smiled widely, ""See! You""re agreeing on something."" They just blinked at him. It was easy to see that they were not his usual clients. Not being able to agree wasn""t the problem; it was just a result of many other issues. And they would not be happy to hear about them all.

Across from him, on the other side of the table, she stared at him in a sort of stunned horror. Tapered chin, aristocratic nose, large eyes with long fluttery lashes, high cheekbones, plump pale lips, beautifully fine-boned face. Fairylike. Ethereal. Beautiful. Her blonde hair was pulled back exactly as he remembered, pale gold wisps framing her lovely face in soft waves. Her painfully familiar face was set upon a slim, delicate neck, though her sloping shoulders seemed broader; less frail than he remembered. With a sudden sickening feeling of realization and recognition, his eyes widened, jaw slackening ever so slightly. It had been far too long since he had last seen her, but it was unmistakably, without a doubt, her.

He had happily fucked the younger brother of a schoolmate. Well, mate would be the wrong word. The other boy wouldn""t report Peter to the police for fear that his brother would be arrested as well, so instead he took every opportunity to beat Peter up, or try. Usually it ended up with Peter as the victor, a little bruised, but standing on his own two feet while the other boy panted on the ground. Peter, except for that one boy, had always been discreet. There was even a club at Whetstone boarding school solely for people of the male-persuasion, though they told the teachers it was for sport. Peter smirked. Sex was like a sport, he supposed.

Bridge was surprised by the guy""s attitude as he left; it was obvious this guy planned on hurting Kat again, or trying to slow down her progress somehow. Bridge had no idea what this guy could do to hold Kat back, but he didn""t take any chances he went back to the command center and reported what he had heard to Commander Cruger. ""Well, Bridge, I""m glad you brought this to my attention, I""ll have to find new therapist for her, this guy poses to much of a threat to her well being"" Commander Cruger said.

He had it pulled back into a ponytail, which hung out from under his captain""s hat. His grey eyes held a sort of domestic ferocity to them, if there was such a thing. He had a long overcoat, chain boots that were referred to as ""Mud Stompers"", leather pants, a swashbuckler""s shirt with a black vest over it and a pistol in a holster at his side.

I could never sleep in my eight hundred dollar bed at home, but in a small sleeping bag I could. Oh the irony. -Later- I was shaken awake by an annoyingly perky voice. ""It""s time for dinner! Get up, get up!"" Slowly opening my eyes I found a small girl wearing pig tails and a pink dress. I had seen her earlier when I first entered the cabin. ""Luke told me to wake you for dinner!"" she smiled. A little, perfect smile. ""Thanks. Who are you?"" ""I""m Katie Jones, undetermined."" ""Keller Frost, same."" She smiled again, she smiled a lot.

I walked to the edge of the small creek, next to the little stone bridge. I put my hands in the icy cold water and gave a sigh. Suddenly, I noticed Navi""s wings perk up a bit, and she was turned towards the rest of the field. I studied her, and she was still for a few moments, until she began to float slowing to the ground. Quickly she beat her wings a little, then fluttered in excitement. She flew behind me and tried to pull me up by grabbing my hat. ""Come on! Link, get up!"" she said, as she continued to pull up on my hat. My hat slid off my head and Navi went flying a few feet up in the air. She stopped, looked at my hat that she was holding, and gave a little squeal. She quickly flew over the creek and towards the center of Hyrule Field. I jumped the creek, and after landing on the other side and taking a few giant leaps for Navi, I heard a big splash from behind me. Shit. Hope I didn""t drop anything!

""Have I offended you?"" he asked as he leaned back just enough to speak. ""I..."" she hesitated. ""I""m a priestess."" Ahkmenrah was about to ask what she meant by the random statement until he remembered himself better.

The man continued to pound away while Duo dragged a chair under the vent and stood on it, using a minature screwdriver (which had also been hidden in his braid) to patiently loosen and remove the cover. When it came free, he pulled himself up into the vent duct, about to crawl away when an immature whim struck him. Unable to resist, Duo hung his head out of the duct, his braid falling towards the floor, and stuck out his tounge at the enraged man. ""Heh heh heh,"" he chuckled, then crawled through the vent system towards where he estimated his Gundam was, choking on the dust. Did they *ever* clean these things? Only one more thing to do. When Duo came to a crossways in the vents, he gently laid the explosives on the ground and flicked off the safety. The small package was akin to the stuff used to self-destruct the Gundams, and this was a slighter larger package than most. Once more Duo checked his watch - 3 minutes and 7 seconds. Time was getting short. Hurriedly Duo punched the remote control password, then removed the small transmitter-detonator from its latch on the explosives and clutched it tightly as he clambered down the vent. 1 minute 27 seconds later, Duo dropped out of the vent duct again, gripping his handgun with his left hand and the tranmitter-detonator in his right. Docking bay 2-E was right in front of him. Perfect again. ""Hell, some days *I* am the Perfect Soldier,"" Duo informed the empty dock before climbing into his Gundam and detaching from the base.

She had been trying to sue for peace with them, trying to explain that Torchwood would not fight them if they and the planet were not threatened, but they had ignored her pleas and taken her anyway. The child felt anger bubble under the surface of her skin. Her father had always taught her, from what he had seen of Silurians in the past, they were not a mindlessly violent race, they were just extremely protective of Earth, as they saw it as their planet, and the humans as the invaders who stole it. Well, now she knew better than him. They weren""t just protective at all; they were evil.

A slot in the door slid open, and the guard peered in at her. ""Can""t you hold it?"" He demanded, aggravated as all the guards seemed to be. ""No! Dude, I""ve been holding it ever since I got here. Please?"" She asked again. The slot slid shut, and then the door opened. ""Come on,"" he told her. He pointed at a door marked ""Restroom"" just down the hall. ""And hurry up!"" He barked. ""Thank you!"" Maria called as she practically flew down the hall and into the bathroom. A few minutes later, feeling much better, she stepped back out into the hall, expecting to see the guard waiting for her. But he was gone. Weird. What was she supposed to do? Lock herself back in the cell? She walked over to it, unsure. She didn""t want to go back in the dark, but knew that staying out would get her in trouble, most likely. But, knowing these guys, going back in could mean trouble, too. Before she could make a decision, however, a different guard appeared at the end of the hallway opposite of her. ""You!

Ignoring the dirty looks the mourning Alphas were giving him, he was able to force his way to the front of the stage in a short amount of time. After a moment to brace himself, he went under the stage, which was hidden behind a curtain. He found himself looking down the barrel of a fusion rifle. When the Future Comes......

Rodney heard a high-pitched ""Mr. Sheppard!"" from Miss Brown and knew there""d be more gossip about him again. Sighing, Rodney moved across the room to shut the door and turn on the lights. John infuriated him more than anyone else in the world, and Rodney loved him for it. Still, he thought as he opened the blinds to look over the university grounds, their differences did make things difficult. No wonder Countess Weir had scoffed at him mixing with another clan. But Rodney liked John, and he had more of a future with that man than with Sam Carter (who, yes, he had a crush on, but there was no spark age whatsoever, except out of hate). Running his tongue over his own fangs, he let them recede before sitting down and turning his attention to the tasks of the day.

Kagome and Tori came out from backstage a few minutes later, dressed in their own clothes. Botan came rushing up to greet them.

FrostIron - Tony/Loki Longer sum-up: Tony and Loki have been ""together"" even before the events of Thor and then after Thor and Ironman2 and then Loki was taken away to Asgard for punishment after the Avengers. And that was the time when Tony realized that he was actually f*cking in love with the crazy god. And he seeked some shelter from loneliness near his piano. After returning from Asgard, Loki wants to know why does he always look so sad when he sits near his piano. And Tony tries everything to avoid answering.

The building was as peaceful as the whole world around. Which was only surprising since it was full of people. The miracle happened and the Avengers got to go on a few days of holiday (but strictly within a defined radius and only for the weekend) after Tony, Bruce and Loki blew up half of the lab-floor because they had nothing better to occupy themselves with. So actually they weren""t much on a holiday - they were rather banished from the Avengers Tower - yet Tony stubbornly stuck to call their little time-out a well-deserved holiday, because apparently no one banishes Tony Stark from his own tower (except for Pepper, but that""s another question).

It was on a high mountain, that had a ledge that looked out over all of the land. On the right side, was a waterfall that flowed into the river that flowed into the Western Pack. Below at the very start of the river was a small lake which served as a watering hole for all of the Pack. Peter stood on the ledge, looking out on the beautiful landscape before. He smiled at all the hard work he had done. The river that went to the Western pack, now went through all of the land, giving water to everyone who was miles away from the watering hole. It took Peter and his best wolves to dig out the paths for the water to flow. Just a few months ago, there were some animals that couldn""t get to the watering hole but thanks to Peter, that was now possible. Sarah was at the entrance of the King""s den, cleaning and grooming Humphrey for his ceremony. She wanted him to look his best, since he opened his eyes for the first time yesterday, making the King and Queen happier than they ever been. ""He""s beautiful... I guess he got that from you... angel,"" Peter said, walking up to his mate and looking down at Humphrey. Humphrey opened his eyes and saw Peter looking at him, making him smile and reaching his tiny paws to him. Peter smiled and grabbed his son, hugging him softly, so he wouldn""t mess his fur up. ""Be careful honey, don""t mess up his fur, I worked really hard on it,"" Sarah said, smiling softly. ""Oh don""t

He remembered now, the priestess had tortured him, the torment not unlike the weapon Fred had used on him the night of Angel""s return. Except this time he had practically asked for it, foolishly believing he could handle anything the woman might throw his way. What doesn""t kill you, makes you stronger , had been one of Holtz""s favourite sayings. Yet whatever the witch had used, had hurt. Badly. His nerves were still twitching uncontrollably, unable to relax, anticipating more of the soul-shattering pain that had been sent screaming into his body, collapsing his resistance. ""Connor."" The male voice made him go very still. ""Your father""s here."" My father""s dead , he nearly said, mind still ragged and raw, unsure himself whether he was speaking of Holtz or Angel. Rolling to one side, not even bothering with an attempt to rise on boneless legs, Connor brushed aside the hair that had fallen into his eyes with a hand that shook shamefully, to observe the man crouched in the sand beside him. He bore a certain familiarity, yet Connor was certain they had not met. He never forgot a scent, a useful tool in Quor-toth for tracking prey, but there was something tantalising reminiscent about this man, like a very old, frayed memory. Seeing Connor""s suspicions, the stranger confirmed, quietly, ""I used to work for your father...before you were taken."" It didn""t take much to work out who the man with the haunted eyes and the unshaven jaw was. Back before Angel""s return, Connor had heard Fred and Gunn arguing over someone named Wesley, when they thought him safely

It was only them two... about to have three. The town knew of the mother""s expectancy; they had dropped off gifts for the new born and mother-to-be; never bothering to look at the world news to make a connection. They had said that the world can be a troublesome thing. They all wished the two well on parenthood. They had spent months with each other after arriving; cherishing each other; preparing for the unknowns of parenthood. The town doctor asked if she could be of assistance; they smiled and said a polite ""no thank-you.' She gave them her home phone incases of an emergency. They thanked her and she went on her way. The due date was very near and both mother and father were excited. They held each other to stay out the cold. Thick sheets and a small room fire helped too. Everything was on stand-by. ""Love... I need you."" Said the mother, grabbing lightly to the father""s cupped sack. He sharply inhaled, ""You are so close though..."" ""Just a little thryst... Let me feel you. Stretch me some...""

Text2: A man named Orochimaru had appeared, attacking Sasuke and leaving him with the Curse Mark, for what reason at the time that he did not know. And, to his surprise, Kakashi was the first to take immediate action to seal the curse mark. (He remembered faintly blushing at the fact that Kakashi had seen him without his shirt on for some reason) And after that, Kakashi had taken an odd interest in Sasuke, offering to train him one on one. Sasuke was elated with this news, but he didn""t show it. For him, this was an act and he was the actor-he was to be his usual, indifferent self so that he didn""t betray the thoughts of how he was enjoying this alone time far too much. And as Kakashi taught him Chidori, Sasuke couldn""t help but think that he reminded him vaguely of the time he trained with his father. Kakashi would have made a better father he can""t help but think, even though he regrets the fact that he would prefer Kakashi over his own father. Did Kakashi see him like a son? Somewhere deep down...he hoped not. No...something a little more different than son... After the Chunnin exams, one particular day, Naruto suggested finding out what Kakashi was hiding under his mask. Sasuke automatically knew that he had to find out what he kept under his mask. What kind of lips does Kakashi-sensei have? What kind of teeth does he have? What does his tongue look like? How would those feel? But they had failed to find out. And his fantasies intensified greatly. Sometimes it was he that told Kakashi all the strange feelings that was coursing through him. Sometimes it was Kakashi that said all the right words.

That""s why I want you to join."" Tetsuka thought that maybe their deal was not going to be that bad. Truthfully, she accepted the offer because of 60% wanting to get out of the house, and 40% curiosity of the organization. Or maybe it was actually 50:50. ...No. She was more interested in living out of the Kuroko household, of course.

They entered the place from another entrance, which was an old, unused stable or barn near the dormitory building. On their way to the base-camp, Akashi explained a bit about their organization. Apparently, Almighty was a company where they train many young teenagers to excel in almost everything, which made them almost ""Almighty""-can do anything. There are three divisions; Junior Division-which was based in Middle School, Senior Division-High school, and the Main Division, which was based in mostly university level.

A surge between both bodies had shocked Sideswipe""s processor, his optics flashed as he took a deep breath into his intakes. He looked around, his vision a little blurred from the speed of the awakening. He felt so weak and sore, he could barely find the strength to move his servos. His hands felt hollow and cold, but they didn""t hurt. They were being held, he could feel a warm hand against his own. Gently but firmly holding it, and caressing him? Sideswipe tilted his helm, squinting his eye components to try and make the image a little clearer. He could see a red figure, he only knew one red figure in his lifetime. ""Dino?...Ah!"" He jumped at his hand again, were his bare wires and Dino""s fingertips were sparking impulses up his hand. Damn, they felt good, he thought, sighing deeply.

The only answer was a tiny girl climbing into his bed, and Don smiled. As Big Brother, he could banish any nightmare. -BD- Present Day Charlie yawned as she made her way up to bed. She""d spent most of the night working out in the garage, and had gotten to a point where she was happy to leave off and go to sleep. As she passed the dining room, she smiled.

Text2: Castiel froze in his tracks, shocked. Gabriel was sitting on a sofa whilst Dean rode him. From Dean""s breathy moans, both parties were quite obviously happy with their dynamic. It took a moment before the sigil on Dean""s back registered through Castiel""s shock. When it did he quickly retreated back downstairs. It was a sign not often seen, one which claimed the human as an angel""s mate. Which, he realised, meant that Gabriel had feelings for Dean - strong feelings - and wanted those feelings to be returned. For the bonding sigil to have held, it had to mean that Dean at least had the potential to love Gabriel back. Given that the human was still in the house, and participating in consensual sex, they were on their way to a proper marriage. Castiel hadn""t been aware that it was possible for a bonding to override the slave collar. He was fairly sure that Gabriel would be getting in trouble with the status quo loving Archangels for bonding with a slave. But even though Castiel wanted to rid his brain of the image, his brother was quite clearly happy with his arrangement. Castiel sat on the living room floor and curled his wings around himself. Once again the memory of the previous night intruded on his thoughts, blocking out visions of Gabriel and Dean. He hated that he was being so weak. He""d almost lost himself and had sex with Sam. Beautiful Sam with no free will of his own. No way to tell Castiel no. Sighing, he leaned against the wall near the back door, looking out into the garden, and allowed himself to relax a little. Before he knew it, he""d fallen asleep, wings still curled tightly around himself to form a shield. ""Hey Fluffy,"" he heard dimly.","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Text2: Katara forgot that Toph was not the Blind Bandit now: now, she wore the mask of the fragile little daughter of the Bei Fong family, and all of that power was stowed away and hidden. His breath caught, as the words reverberated over and over around the stone ring. He knew no one would, could, do what Katara was asking Toph to do, just now. She was asking that Toph reveal her secrets, remove that mask for her father to see what was underneath. Aang knew that Lao Bei Fong was to blame for that guise. He was also to blame for that light in Toph""s eyes, that look of a caged bird of prey, given just enough room to taste what the sky may be like before being called back. When a falconer notices this behavior, of course, he may clip the bird""s wings, or discipline it until all the fight is gone and it is simply for show, a lifeless object on display. ""She can""t help you."" Once the mask was gone, what would happen? Katara was asking that this girl, this stranger whom he had just met, risk what meager freedom she had to rescue him. She was being asked to potentially sacrifice the one thing that kept her truly alive, and for whom? Someone she did not even know. We need you. The whole world had needed him, had called out to him, and he had run away from his duties. Aang himself had not been willing to make the sacrifices Toph was now being asked to: it had been far too frightening to imagine giving up the things he loved, his freedom, his life, for the benefit of a remote humanity and its concerns. Even now he feared the surrender of such things, wondered if","{""output"": ""NO""}"

After math was done, then second period started. Warren was still in his bad mood. It was at lunch before Raven decided to ask what was wrong.

"" Nothing is with him, he just doesn""t feel like talking right now."" Raven looked at Warren; he was still as quiet as a mouse. Maybe he was trying to get his rep back, but it was beginning to scare her. When school finally ended, Raven sat in an empty seat and waited for Warren. And when he did arrive, he sat down as if someone had pissed him off. "" Are you ok?"" Warren""s face softened when he looked at her. "" Yea, I""m ok now."" He took her hand and placed it on his knee. Raven shivered and then relaxed. Warren wasn""t mad at her, so she would be ok. "" So...why did you come here?""

Clint had Amanda huddled up in his arms, sheltering her as best he could between his body and a sparse tree. They had to get here soon, they had to. She was bleeding out. They had to come soon. Clint sat outside the room, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. He""d been there in the hospital for four days now, sometimes he""d sit inside her room, sometimes he""d sit outside, watching in through the window - it upset him too much to be in the room all the time. The mission went bad from the get go; the Russians had known they were coming and the element of surprise was turned against the team of two. Natasha should have been there, but she""d been sent on another mission by herself. Clint and Amanda had made fair progress irregardless, but they""d been swamped - the Russians teamed up against them, cornered them and Amanda had gone down.

Aang presses his lips together. Still wearing that infuriatingly unknowing expression, Toph leans against the wall, knowing exactly what she is doing. ""You""re not going to let me go, are you?' ""I have no idea what you""re talking about.' Damn it. Hell to the meeting. Aang doesn""t care, and the bulge in his trousers would insist the very same. Taking two strides over, he slams his mouth onto hers, his hands slipping beneath her robe, and smoothing his palms up her back. Aang is relentless, passionate, happy; he pushes her up further into the wall, nipping her lower lip. To be honest, Toph thinks it hilarious how easily manipulated the Avatar can be. But another part of her is also aware of the fact only she can achieve this. If it were anybody else, Aang would hardly be effected.

Text2: Translator""s Notes: Despite my best effort, it is still not perfectly translated by any means. There will also be occasional rephrasing for added cohesiveness and merged chapters to reinforce length. However, I will try to keep everything as consistent with the original work as possible. I honestly didn""t plan on doing another translation so soon but I guess boredom has its magic. Anyways, I was just browsing through all the Chinese fanfic I could find when I saw this short story. It""s one I read some time ago and I remembered how emotionally impactful it was for me. So upon the decision to reread it, I thought it might be a good idea to translate as I go. Be warned though, this fanfic is not like the typical SessKik stories. Unlike First Sight, Yet Nostaligic, the first translation I did, this one is set in an alternative universe. It also contains no battle scenes and no antagonists like Naraku. In fact, while the plot revolves around SessKik, we won""t get the pair""s perspective at all. This fanfic is from a first person POV and delves into the story in the form of a bystander. If I have to describe it, it""s kind of like a detective solving a case. We get to see a mystery from an outside standpoint and explore the relationships behind those involved. Well, I""ve explained enough for now. Any more and I""m risking spoilers.

Despite his obvious short comings, he was also brave, and he knew what needed to be done, and he would do it, no matter what the circumstance, or how dangerous. I imagine being a spy for the Order couldn""t have been a very safe job, and although I wasn""t necessarily allowed to listen to the meetings, I knew that they needed him.

Just because Slytherins are ambitious and generally care about themselves the most doesn""t mean they can""t have real friends! Lilith and Sophie had nothing in common other than the fact that they were both in Gryffindor and both often overshadowed by the others. Hermione was smart, Lavender and Parvati were popular. Lilith and Sophie were just...there. They formed a bond in their first year, a few short weeks after Sophie realized that she was completely invisible when put next to the other Gryffindor girls. Lilith had just come to the same realization as well. They had never spoken more than a few words to one another but both realized that their bond was close, so it was fitting that their friendship began so nonchalantly. Lilith sat down next to Sophie at breakfast two weeks into their first year and said, ""Pass the apple sauce, please."" Sophie did as

To everyone""s surprise, Genzo and Jin paled until they resembled a white bed sheet, screamed in terror and then ran from the set as if the devil were on their heels. Harry-kun was not much better off, although his feet seemed to be rooted on the spot. He twitched as if held by some unseen force.

Babbling like an idiot, Harry-kun immediately threw himself at Kyoko""s feet and bowed over and over. Amazed and not a little disturbed, director Harada watched the scene.

""I""ll be back in three years time, I hope, but until then, don""t let France visit, and-"" England stopped mid-sentence, closed his eyes, and sighed deeply, ""America, are you listening?"" When America nodded, fixated on playing with the buttons on his shirt, England smiled in endearment, ""It""s like talking to a brick wall."" He laughed into the Summer air and his hair gleamed golden in the sunlight. ""Goodbye, America,"" He ruffled the boys unkempt hair, placed a kiss on his forehead. Hesitantly, he added, ""America... stay out of trouble."" Something clicked in America just then, because even though he was small and weak- a profit venture for England, he was sure- the sight of him turning around and heading towards the ship made his throat feel strange. Not sore, but small and constrained. ""Go well,"" America waved to England, and his voice sounded unstable. ""Stay well,"" England responded instantly, turning to face him once more, ""Stay well, America."" America watched from the dock as England climbed the ramp onto the ship. Perhaps he would wave to him, but that seemed unlikely because he was gone to the other side of the ship, away from his view. Within moments, he heard a great groaning as the ship began to uproot the anchor and catch wind. He watched until the tip of the sail had disappeared over the horizon. When it was finally gone, he wiped his eyes. July, 1776 The room was filled with the sound of ink on paper, paper on desk, the large swoop of John Hancock""s signature, until he turned

I come here and work, share some of my knowledge of business with you, and every once in awhile, I put in a good word for you with Zelda. Hmm?"" Eyes darting back and forth between Luv and his own hands, he finally conceded, but with a great sense of relief, as if he had been restricting himself from the inevitable the whole time. ""Yes.""

""So what did the healer say?"" ""It will scar,"" Danilo reported morosely. ""Well, we already knew that,"" Elaith stated. ""Anything more helpful?"" ""Keep the sores clean and they will hurt less."" That wasn""t all that helpful either. Their hygienic opportunities were rather limited at the moment. A nice proper bath, such as the healer had probably had in mind, certainly wasn""t on the horizon anytime soon. At least not for Danilo. He himself could go home and have one whenever he began to want it more than to stay with Danilo. ""Well, we can ask for a bowl of fresh water whenever the warden returns with my blanket,"" he suggested. Danilo looked at his two blankets a little guiltily. Elaith shrugged it off. ""I don""t actually need one, but it was a nice gesture."" Arilyn, though she arrived a day late, proved to be the most practical and least traumatising of Danilo""s visitors, supplying him with such luxuries as a razor and hairbrush, parchment, ink and even a lute to play on, dealing with the situation rather than berating him for getting himself into it. Apparently her only reaction to the sores had been to inquire whether they hurt. Danilo didn""t say what his answer had been and Elaith didn""t press. He seemed to have grown somewhat resigned and accustomed to his condition now and wasn""t quire as apt to burst into tears,

Two black and white cows were standing behind a fence on the other side of the road, and as he walked past them they both began bellowing loudly. The chickens inside the coop began squawking a moment later, and despite how badly he felt, Kyle couldn""t help but laugh at the cacophony he""d caused. There was no porch light. Kyle wearily climbed the three stairs onto the porch, the headlights behind him throwing double shadows on the metal siding of the trailer. He hoped that if this wasn""t Stan""s house, at least whoever lived here was kind. Whoever""s house this was kept their porch neat, and Kyle scraped his shoes carefully on the edge of the top step before moving ahead toward the trailer door to wipe his shoes again on the welcome mat. His heart was pounding hard and he could feel it in this throat, and he wasn""t sure if it was from fear that it wouldn""t be Stan who answered the door, or if he was about to have a heart attack. He pressed his cheek against the door and knocked. What sounded like a very large dog began barking inside. He knocked again, and the strength almost went out of his legs when he recognized the voice from the other side of the door. ""Come in?"" It was Stan, on the other side of this cheap mobile home door, inviting him into his house. Kyle felt at least some of his strength returning with the relief that at least no one was about to shoot him. He wrapped his hand around the doorknob and twisted. For a second he thought it was locked, then the knob turned and the door swung away from him. He

He raised one hand and thrust it into a wailing sphere of darkness, withdrawing after a moment with a clipboard. ""Explain this report, if you please."" He tossed it onto the end of her bed. Rather than make the undignified stretch-or worse, crawl-Shelke swung out from under the covers and padded to the end of the bed to pick it up. She chose to ignore Nero""s dramatically disappointed sigh. If he wanted sport, he could trouble Azul or Rosso. The report came from one of the soldiers involved in the Kalm mission. Shelke skimmed it, noting that nearly two hundred of the pure had been collected, but a hundred or so soldiers lost. Not an unacceptable outcome-Deepground had plenty of reserves-but something that would have to be monitored. This particular officer had been informed, like every soldier sent aboveground, of the necessity of finding and detaining the Keeper of the Protomateria. Fortunately for the officer, he had not been one of those that had encountered Vincent Valentine, and consequently dispatched back to the Lifestream. ""I see nothing that needs explanation,"" she said. ""Is that so?"" Nero plucked the clipboard from her grasp and flicked through the pages. Finding the line he wanted, he handed it back to her, tapping the place with one black nail. Obediently, Shelke read. The order was given to capture the Keeper of the Protomateria dead or alive... Ah. ""You are aware, Shelke, that we need Vincent Valentine to be captured alive, are you not?"" Nero arched an eyebrow at her.

Lightning watched me with thinly veiled reservation, but she said nothing in acknowledgement of it as she nodded to me. She began to turn away, when I called out to her again. ""Hey Lightning?"" Lightning looked over her shoulder to me and met my eyes. I cleared my throat, wanting so badly to close the distance between us. But I knew that if I got to close to her, then there would be no way that I""d ever let her go. So I stayed where I stood as I addressed her again. ""Is this goodbye then? ...Forever?"" She held my gaze without saying a word. Unless I was imagining it again, Lightning almost looked remorseful and sad. ""I""ll see you around I suppose... but I doubt we""ll talk like this again.""

Her father was probably working outside. Nicole yawned sat down on a chair, and looked around the room. It was probably in the afternoon now since the sun was high in the sky.

""Now don""t play games darling, Nancy be a dear and open the door."" When Nicole got to the door, three women walked in with boxes followed by a man in black and white very expensive clothing.

Neon lights of plush violet and ice blue danced across his partially revealed face from a nearby sign for some kind of restaurant. His eyes weren""t on the restaurant though. The blue eyes were glancing across the street. A sad scowl marred his face like a battle scar and he began his walk across the street, not caring when a rider-less motorcycle nearly ran him over. He didn""t bother to even remotely question it in the back of his mind. The walk took a long three minutes because of the slow advance of the small feet, but he made it.

Taking away them all, a golden bow lay, crackling with lightening when he picked it up. ""I need to store these somewhere. All of these."" However, the ghost of a king paid his words no heed, his ""eyes"" fixated at the golden bow. ""You have... his bow?"" He reached out to touch it, then suddenly snatched it from him and was somehow able to hold the bow, carefully inspecting it. ""After all these years..."" He closed his eyes and gave it back to the hooded man. ""Destroy it."" He blinked in surprise. ""What?"" ""Destroy it. I will take care of the Sword of Souls and the Sacred Chalice myself, but you must destroy the Thunderbird Bow. No one else is to wield it. It was only meant for him.""

His were dark, clouded with the painful memories of unnecessary deaths, of truths best left unsaid... of a fate that he would have rather not chosen. No joy ever shone forth; happiness was a concept lost to him. Her eyes, however, were bright and clear; whatever tragedies had fallen into her life, she refused to let them trouble her. To the young woman, the misfortunes were nothing more than stones in the river of her life; they would not stop her. At first, Zelda was repulsed by the suffering she could see in Ike""s solemn navy eyes. She had known too many people with that mournful expression, and knew what eventually happened to most of them; she fully expected the man to also sink into a spiral of self-destruction and hatred. Watching him fight only confirmed the princess"" beliefs; his savage style reeked of uncontrolled fury, each violent stroke made with deadly intentions. Not even the women were exempt from his wrath; they felt the flames of Ragnell burn just as intensely for them as for the largest of the men.

Elena could be in danger, she could be dead by now, and we were all just standing around. There had to be something we could do. ""We need to find where Klaus has taken Elena so we can save her, Bonnie. Can""t you track her or something?"" I begged. ""She""s with her parents,"" Bonnie sighed, her eyes rolling into the back of her head and she dropped to the ground. I reached out and caught her before she hit the floor. I carefully sat her up on the stairs and her eyes snapped open. ""She""s at the graveyard, but she""s in danger, we need to get there!"" she yelled. ""Klaus is too strong, we need help. We can""t fight him alone!"" Katherine said as I turned to leave the house. I swung into my car and kicked the engine into life. Bonnie sprinted towards me and hopped into the passenger""s seat, staring stubbornly at me. ""Bonnie, it""s going to be dangerous,"" I told her. Katherine stood by the side of the car and knocked on my window. I rolled it down as Stefan moved to get into the back. ""Oh no you don""t Stefan, I can""t trust you,""

She found herself again on the brink of an anxiety attack as this was her first flight ever. Skarlet did not like being in situations where she had no control over her own safety. She turned to Sub-Zero. ""Are you sure this thing can fly? How is it possible that something so large and heavy looking can take flight?"" She asked nervously as she clutched Sub-Zero""s hand tight. ""Yes my love. Do not worry, flying is actually considered the safest way to travel."" Skarlet doubted it.

Is it about the terrible, awful incident at the Red Lion? I wonder if I""m in trouble? Her eyes were pulled again to the mantelpiece but this time to the locket.

Emerging with a gasp from the center of the steaming mass was Ryu. He paused briefly and looked around from the top of the smoldering mountain of bizarre corpses. Gross. The pile had become unstable and Ryu struggled to extricate himself from the hot, sticky mess. As he headed down the side of the large mound, every third or fourth step would break through the bony carapaces of the bodies causing him to sink up to his waist in the nightmarish offal. Forging his way forward, Ryu waded through a gooey, melting sea of limbs, crazily staring heads and singed, bloated abdomens that seeped and dripped with thick, rancid fluids. He wrapped his scarf around his face, but it didn""t do much to shield him from the full force of the toxic stench as he continued to power through the gory mass of destruction. With a final wrench, he freed his leg from the pile of dissolving corpses and looked back at the way he had come. Ryu could see the ragged trail he had made through the huge mound of bodies. Now that he had some distance, Ryu could also see above, where the creatures had fallen through the floor of the arena with him. They had plunged through several sub-levels and were now in a wide, dimly lit basement corridor. It looked almost like the floor of a hospital, or scientific laboratory. Ryu walked a few meters down the hallway and once the stink had decreased to a tolerable level, he stopped under one of the overhanging fluorescent lamps, where he paused","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He spotted her in the cockpit as she turned to him and saw her lips move, shouting the words ""Deleted!"" to him.

""Something""s happening to the big ship!"" Hawkeye shouted, being the first to spot the explosions, as everyone else took notice. The Cyber fighters all quickly turned, just moments away from destroying each of them, and flying back towards their flagship. ""Well I""ll be damned!"" Falco shouted, laughing and cheering as Fox and the others watched on. Peppy scratched his head as the explosions slowly reached up all the way to the front of The Messenger. ""The Main engine seems to have exploded from inside. Now what do you suppose could have suddenly caused that kind of chain reaction?"" The remaining Cyber ships soon turned away from The Messenger, flying away and scattering themselves across the galaxy, as two other ships suddenly appeared from the fireballs, flying away from the Messenger as it floated aimlessly through space, and exploded spectacularly into a great mass of fire","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Over the other side of the room Detritus was lovingly arranging his rockery on his bedside table. /Just don""t ask,/ thought Vimes, /Just don""t ask!/ Otto had already colonised the walk-in-wardrobe as his bed, on the premise that it was dark enough and had a bar for him to hang on; also the smell mothballs reminded him of Uberwald.

Dibbler revealed the fruits of his labour, highly suspicious sausages coated in what was probably (all though with Dibbler nothing was ever certain) Wow-Wow sauce. The air shimmered above the plate of hot dogs in a heat haze. There was the suggesting of blistering of the varnish on the wooden table top. Vimes, feeling perhaps it was his duty to take the first sausage, picked one up gingerly and took a bite. Encouraged by the fact that his expression did not change greatly as he chewed, the others followed suite. Vimes swallowed. There was a brief pause in which nothing more happened than Vimes""s eyes beginning to cross. He managed to say something that sounded a bit like ""Margh!' but modulated and about three octaves higher than his normal vocal range; suggesting an action normally associated with the secret horseman""s words. He ran out of the house and into the garden, closely followed by most of the other hosuemates. There was a splash as he hit the water of the swimming pool and then the hiss of rising steam.

With a great splash, his water clothing falls down, drenching the tatami matt he""s seated upon. The emotional turmoil is too great- like a wave rising up in him, flooding all his senses, crashing down, down, down on him until the only thing he can do is cry. Drowning in himself, in this feeling. He is naked, as vulnerable as the day he was born. Victor does not give a second glance to it, throwing the sword aside and picking Yuuri up, and embracing him. Rocking him from side to side, he tightens his arms around him, entangled with the overwhelming feeling within. Yuuri... Yuuri just cries. Victor has never been good with emotional situations. Thing reach him, he understands, logically what is happening, but when it comes to a response... He does not know how to deal with it at all. This usually ends in three reactions: A. He analyses what the other person is doing and then says exactly what he thinks. This usually ends with them crying harder. B. He ignores them, which is an even worse option than the first, because this ends with grudges for life, and certainly not on his end. C. He panics. This option has had very strange actions attached and an even wider range of reactions towards the strange behaviour. So when Yuuri starts to cry, Victor jumps straight to option C. He has no idea what to do, and the panic crawls along his spine like terror thousand fold. He doesn""t know how to talk about this. By Izanami- that is what started this in the first place! If he""d just- known how to bring this,

A.N.: As always, remember to review if there are any problems you see so far with the story. ...There was a lonely troll that guarded the pathway to his junk-filled swamp. No one would talk to him, for everyone he encountered was afraid of him. Soon, that fear evolved into unneeded hate & blaming anger. As a result, they sent a group of raging villagers & people looking for a quest. They never beat him though, but he tried his best to not hurt them & tried to reason with his attackers before getting angry and attacking them out of rage. This, unfortunately, only made his reputation worse. Anyone that returned from their battle with the troll only spread rumors about his strength & aggressiveness or warned others about his strengths & weaknesses. One day, the Royal Knights came to him. As they approached, the troll wondered why the knights had come. When they reached him, he asked, ""What is it that thou want? Another pointless battle?"" The captain of the royal knights replied by saying, ""Hopefully not, troll of the swamp. Instead of a battle, we have come seeking the royal princess.

The windows emanated very little light, no warmth, and everything about the place screamed Death. Damon would die in there if she didn""t help him. There was no doubt about that. ""I hate Damon,"" she reminded herself. She had waged an internal battle with herself as she tried to decide what to do. ""I""ll just call Elena and Stefan and have them come and collect Damon - or his corpse, most likely."" She sighed. Elena and Stefan. God, they would never forgive her if she just let Damon die in there. She could call them, sure, but she didn""t think that Damon had the luxury of time. Especially not with cray cray Rebekah on the loose. ""Elena, Stefan, I""m doing this for you,"" she whispered. She reasoned that as much as she hated Damon, she loved Elena and Stefan way more. She crept up the front steps and quietly turned the doorknob. Everything was quiet - maybe too quiet. The corridor was dark as she tip-toed along. She finally reached the dining hall where Damon was chained up. He looked even worse than before. Blood oozed from at least five separate wounds. Bonnie felt sick at the sight of it but forced herself forward. ""Who""s there?"" Damon asked and she saw him squinting in her direction. He weaved on his feet and Bonnie was certain that he""d topple if the chains somehow gave way. Which they didn""t seem destined to do by themselves. Bonnie knew she could never pry them open either. This called for magic. Using magic to save another vampire. The irony was not lost on her. ""Who""s there?"" Damon asked loudly. She immediately stepped forward and smacked a hand over

The sun was setting as she passed a window; it marked the end of yet another sweltering day in the summer of Gensokyo. There hasn""t been a day during every summer when she hadn""t cursed at the humid weather; the plants in the garden behind the shrine were wilting from the heat, save those that survived in hot seasons, the water she had retrieved from the well equally boiling hot, even the wooden floor was unforgiving on her bare foot. The sunset casted an orange glow across the whole of Gensokyo, and that was also the same when Reimu made it back to her room. She reckoned that if she were to slather some of the shrine""s prayer oil on her body, she would be a glowing beacon that could be seen from miles away.

Then, with eager anticipation, he raised his voice to project it loudly into the night.

The gay little blue star twinkled a few more times, then, the light dimmed and she was gone. The star had disappeared. Pitch Black swung his dark ax in a swift slash to the left, warning away the nightmare that had just about nipped him in the shoulder. Another nightmare reared to his right, its black hooves thrashing in the air towards his face. Pitch was forced to duck the powerful strikes, but not soon enough. One of the pawing hooves clipped him a hard one on the chin, sending him staggering backwards onto the cold hard pavement. The nightmares whinnied loudly, their vicious war cries trumpeting the come of their impending victory. They gathered around him now, red eyes gleaming, nostrils fuming smoke, snorting viciously. Pitch, in pain and disoriented, scarcely had the strength or the wits about him to possibly avoid what was about to come. The nightmares trampling hooves were pawing ever closer. Maybe they would do him the favor of knocking him out- putting him out of his misery. He thought he could last until she came... He had thought he could defeat these fears. He had been wrong.

She didn""t know much about sex, was in fact still a virgin, but she had a good idea of it and left the rest to her imagination. She had felt this aroused feeling with Naruto sometimes, thinking about him kissing her, petting her, maybe his head...down there. She blushed wildly, and then let the erotic thought roam to Kakashi""s head down there, and she gasped a little to herself, feeling bad that she was thinking of such things...but it excited her! And the way he had been handling Chiyori made her body thrum for that experience, that need for sex that she had yet to experience. Her fingers slid down her body and past her panties, to where a wet spot was forming. She rolled onto her stomach, her favourite way to do it, and after ten minutes she was gasping and squirming and biting her sheets and pillows to prevent from screaming out loud, and to her mixed shock and victory she was thinking about Kakashi, not Naruto for once, and she felt so dirty after, but so exhilarated, she lay there, panting harshly, face flushed.

The look on Madhea""s face became even more determined. ""Mew!"" Sharie sighed. From what she had read, the scientists had figured that being able to control Madhea from birth would make it much easier to bend her will. But it had become quickly clear to Sharie that Madhea""s will was at least as powerful as Mewtwo""s, if not moreso. If this had been the intents of the scientists, it would have been an utter failure. ""Okay,"" she agreed. ""We""ll try a few steps. But hold on to me."" She stood behind Madhea. Madhea lifted one graceful arm, and Sharie took her hand. The little pokemon then let go of the tree with her other hand. Moments later, Sharie was holding both hands securely, bending over her from behind. Madhea looked up and caught her eye, her amethyst eyes twinkling excitedly. ""Let""s go,"" Sharie urged. ""One foot in front of the other."" Madhea obeyed, but was rather startled by a wave of dizziness after moving just a few steps. Frustrated, she looked up into Sharie""s eyes. ""You aren""t used to being upright, Madhea,"" Sharie answered calmly. ""Give it time. You have to get used to it. Also, you need to use your tail to balance. Making both legs and your tail work together takes practice."" ""I will. I will practice every day. I want to walk."" She tried a few more steps, while Sharie held her hands. This time, she did not get so dizzy. ""That is enough for today,"" Sharie urged quietly. ""Don""t worry, Madhea. In a few days you will be running around as if you never had any cares in the world.

If I ever have a child of my own, I never want him or her to go through that nightmare. What I had experienced as a baby was nothing compared to that. Life went on, and Sharie grew from a baby into a toddler. Long before she could talk, she understood our language, the advantages of being telepathic. By about three months, she was talking our ears off--or trying to. Most infants cannot be easily understood until about six months of age. Ha. Sharie asked me how Father and myself came up with the handle ""Lalinka."" I cannot believe she does not know this by now.... What do you mean, Sharie, that when I started calling you that you was not sure for a time what your real name was? Of course, you were barely a few days old then.... Oh, well. Lalinka is an ancient handle, with affectionate overtones. I also understand it is a Polish word with a similar meaning. It is not too common, but it seemed appropriate, I guess. I guess I just started using it, and did not stop. Father picked up on it, until we were both calling you that more often than your given name. By now my hand is so sore, I can barely write this.

When he went into the backyard, Kenneth was sitting in a tree. ""I""m too old to climb up there,"" he told his son. ""I don""t want company, anyway."" ""I know you don""t.

""It wasn""t dumb, Kenneth. We all hoped for so many years and then to finally have news, it just seemed so promising."" ""You""re just saying that."" Kenneth shoved his hands in his pockets with a scowl.

I say grabbing him by the collar to my height and kissing him passionately. When I pulled away he was stunned. I smiled coyly and strolled down the stairs at human speed. I was half way down the stairs before he came out of his stupor, which was a long time for vampire. He came after me, ""What""s the big emergency?"" he asked stunned.

Quietly, Cagalli continued on her way until suddenly a fancy glow-in-the-dark sign board caught her attention- it read: WANTED: WAITRESS 18-25 yrs old Cagalli sighed and thought that it wasn""t the kind of job she had traveled all the way this far. She needed a high paying job- a really high paying job that could get her family out of debt and of course could bring her normal life back. In an instant, Cagalli realized how much she already missed her life in Orb- she missed her family, her mother, her little brother and her friends. Cagalli was only twenty-one years old and yet she was already carrying the burden of being the breadwinner for their family. Actually it wasn""t really in her plan to get to work after graduating in her accountancy course.

Ienzo""s Keyblade appeared as well, and almost involuntarily, he lifted it up to the sky as well. Sora was still running through the maze ahead of his companions. His Keyblade suddenly appeared in his hand while he was running. Glancing up at the sky, he noticed the three beams of light and immediately lifted his Keyblade up to the sky. His own Keyblade shot a beam of light into the sky, connecting with the other three. The large beam of light shot through the sunset sky. The sky lit up as a symbol of pure light was created. There were three circles, one held the Heartless insignia, another, the Nobody symbol, and the final, the symbol of the Keyblade Master, a golden crown with three crests. They were surrounded by various curves, forming an intricate triangle. ""What""s that?"" Trisha gasped as the triangle formed. ""I...don""t know..."" Ienzo

""Quite probably."" said she, soberly, and there was a sudden sadness in her face, as of an old, old pain that can never be forgotten: a sorrow that ran deep, but not so deep as to blot out all else, for there was a great strength in her, and a love that admitted no defeat.

Tony had said that his previous ""benefactors"" were working on something big, and something that involved oil. Axlerod oil. ""Penny for your thoughts, Mater?"" The tow truck jumped, tearing his gaze away from the black and white waves, and met the cool grey (to him) eyes of the old Aston Martin.

As he spoke, he slipped the bag off of his back, and turned to rummage through it. There was some dark muttering around the gorge about how this strange cat was most likely a kittypet come to take some shelter and food for the night. Finally, the Salescat withdrew from the bag, and turned to face the clan, and on his face was another face, one that seemed catlike, but was somehow wrong: the fur was yellow, with high ears that were tipped with black. Several of the onlookers drew back in shock. The Salescat, satisfied, removed the mask with an upraised paw. ""That is the Keaton mask,"" he said brightly. ""It is very popular with the younger crowd!"" Here, he flashed a grin at what he assumed was the nursery, where there were several kits struggling to see the visitor, being held back by their mothers. On another side of the camp, there were two other cats watching, one with gray fur and obviously blind, who looked, for some reason, uneasy. Next to him was a golden tabby whose eyes were sparkling with interest.

In fact, he was always reminding her about them, at least three times a day he pulled her to the bathroom, pointing at the large tub in front of them. And he could sit in the bath for hours (which had concerned her many times when it was unusually quiet in the bathroom). It didn""t appear that Haruka was going to move from his spot and after looking at her watch, Mrs Nanase needed to remind him why they were here in the first place. She couldn""t help but think if she didn""t do anything, he would stare at the ocean forever.

The outbreak was the prelude to something far more terrible. For the last four years the remaining members of the White Diamond Authority or WDA have been observing the progress of the Reanimation Plague on Earth that vestige of human-life in the galaxy. Their attention are drawn to the plight of Rick Grimes and his group, especially the antics of his teenaged son, Carl. They watched as the Grimes group defended their prison sanctuary from The Governor and his militia of civilians. ""White Diamond, that boy is quite impressive"" spoke a woman dressed in a skin-tight interstellar jump suit, emblazoned with a white diamond shaped symbol on her chest. Her oddest features were her sea-foam colored hair and oval gemstone situated on her forehead. ""Yes Aqua, I have been observing him as well"" spoke a very formal looking woman. Her hair was snow white and his cream-color eyes were alight with mirth. ""Has Blue Topaz, sent the results of his Gem Pulse Analysis."" White Diamond inquired intently of Aqua to which she shook her head in the negative. ""Not that I expected much from a peasant."" Aqua added as an afterthought .

So, without further ado; here""s the next chapter. Jason tried hard to remember the speech he prepared on his drive home from the warehouse. He intended to tell Alexis that he loved her, to assure her that he always would and he didn""t want anyone else. Unfortunately, his thoughts were leaving his brain at an alarming pace, due in large part to the assault Alexis was making on his abdomen. They""d barely made it to their bedroom before Alexis had him out of his sweater and his t-shirt. Now, in between kisses, she smiled and said, ""I can""t believe you said, ""you ached for me.'

Epilouge: ""How are you feeling, Holmes?"" Doctor Watson asked for the umpteenth time, lowering his newspaper so that he could see his friend. Sherlock Holmes lounged lazily in his favorite armchair, his pipe in his mouth and his violin leaning up against the upholstery in preparation for use. Holmes opened his eyes with annoyance. ""The more times you ask won""t change my condition, Mother Hen,"" Holmes answered with a sigh of exasperation as he closed his eyes once more. Watson""s eyes flickered down to Holmes"" torso where the doctor had carefully wrapped bags of covered ice around the detective""s ribcage. The ice would ease the swelling, numb the pain, and slow the blood circulation to allow the damaged vessels to heal and the bruises to fade. His wrist was still supported by a splint and a new splint had been fastened around his left ankle. Feeling that Watson was still watching him, Holmes opened his eyes. The irritation disappeared from his expression as his eyes softened. ""And how are you holding up, Old Boy?"" Holmes asked, staring pointedly at Watson""s arms. Watson followed the detective""s gaze and put down the paper to examine his own injuries. His arms had likewise been bandaged with covered ice and it looked as if he wore casts.

He was largely untrusted by a lot of the troops in our ranks and made few friends during his stay.

Because of this key scouting and spying role he often reported directly to me to update me on the enemy""s movements and carry out messages I""d have to our soldiers in other areas of the field.

She was a memorable fuck if anything, it""s almost a shame I hate her too much to ever cross that line again. Then there""s the girlfriend/progeny. I suppose it should mean something that I put girlfriend before progeny but if you have enough time in your day to dissect it , don""t, this story is ten times more interesting than worrying over which title I""m committed to most. I detest titles, but I use them to dumb things down for humans, but more recently I use them to satisfy Tara Thornton, the girlfriend. I suppose when you""re brought up by a woman who cares more about Jack, Morgan, and Jose she might become self conscious of her worth. If I""d known Tara back then I would have advised her with something along the lines of: don""t compete against a bottle smash it against your mother""s skull then leave her in the pool of shards to bleed out and die with the bottle she chose you over. I""m cruel. Expect it. This is the only disclaimer you get. In my defense I care deeply for Tara, anyone or thing with the audacity to hurt her is automatically on my shit list. It""s new to me, caring or rather showing it. I cared for my maker and he never demanded to hear it or see it, at least not in the way Tara wants or needs.

Sometimes I show her in the most amazingly sentimental ways I won""t discuss, ""cause the thought of it affects me physically and I""d prefer to keep down

Text2: He had invited the best supervillains of Gotham to his lair, in an effort to unite them under a common cause - the destruction of Batman. If anything could unite the squabbling bunch of egomaniacs, that was it. The old rivalries from Arkham City and before still burned strongly in the memory of all those attending today, but Crane was confident that he could persuade them. He was the superior intellect of everyone there, even Nygma, although he liked to think otherwise. And the others weren""t totally irrational people - true, they were lunatics, but they could be reasoned with. Not like the Joker. Things were so much easier now that he was gone. Everyone had been happy to hear about the Joker""s death - Crane actually laughed when he read about it in the paper. And then he had stopped laughing when he saw the picture of Harley Quinn underneath the headline, indescribable pain and heartbreak in her eyes. She had been the only person upset by the Joker""s passing. Crane hadn""t seen her in person since he had been back, (although he had delegated her for a special mission to rescue Poison Ivy from prison in Bludhaven) but he heard that she was doing her best to put on a brave face. In public, anyway. It was far too soon after the clown""s passing to declare his feelings for her, thought Crane as he dressed. He could wait. Eventually Harley had to get over the monster, after all, and then he could make his move. First Gotham would be his, and then Harley. And then his triumph would be complete.

They were even larger monsters, and the weaklings were likely to stay out of their way as long as they were quiet. It was a beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky and below the foliage and canopy of the trees, it was cool. A stream ran nearby, and they drank in turn while the other watched for danger. Sephiroth was still reeling from the extreme cold of the water. It trickled down his throat, and settled in his stomach. It felt good, and took the edge off of his quickly renewing hunger. Even more pressing was the sound that was growing louder each moment they lingered. It was a buzz-sawing, grating noise that made him want to scratch at his ears and kill something, but it was nothing like the sounds they used at the facility to torture and control. ""Do you hear it?"" he whispered, beginning to tremble. His face was stricken, looking as if he were struggling with a deeply troubling thought. ""Would they dare come after us?"" ""If they""re stupid, they would,"" Maya responded as she rose, stretching demurely like a feline. ""But honestly, in this forest, is it so hard to believe we could easily take them all down? They raised us the way they wanted - the best, the most bloodthirsty killers in the world."" He was inclined to agree. After all, they""d escaped once, and in a blast of instant recollection he recalled the feeling of crushing that human""s heart in his grasp. It felt good then, but now it frightened him. They split up, and waited in the protection of mother nature, their swords sheathed as the light from the sun would reflect from the perfectly maintained steel.

He folded her close, and they moved the few steps to the bed. He lifted the covers and let her in. She wasn""t wearing those awfuls shoes. She stopped only to take off her jeans and slide beneath the covers in that overlong, long-sleeved shirt. She was hesitant to leave the warmth he gave her. But she slid beneath the covers, and swooned around her tears to find that it was almost unpleasant and deliciously warm beneath the thick, downy blankets. Jake slid in underneath her, lying on his side - and she faced him. He pulled her close, and her forehead pressed against his chest, muffling the quiet little sobs. She recovered quicker now than in the bathroom shower though - growing still and gentle, her breathing deep. Lying across from each other, watching each other. Jake did nothing but rest his hand on her hip beneath her shirt - feeling the soft, warm bare skin rise and fall with each breath. She was trembling because he was touching her. She had her hands tucked up beneath her chin for awhile almost as if in prayer... but she moved them now. She brushed her fingers over his cheekbones, back toward his ears, under his jaw. She saw his jaw muscle pop a little as he shifted his head to lie on the pillow, and there was a drowsy, mesmerized quality in his pale antarctic eyes. Finally her fingertips followed the narrow, numb","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He gently rubbed Clint""s shoulders. They were usually very quiet about their relationship; Clint was uncomfortable with most forms of physical affection. The explanation for that came early on in their relationship: even before the circus, as a child, most of the time when his father touched him it was to hurt him (and this carried on to almost every important male in his life). So he learned it was easier and safer to avoid all forms of physical contact. Phil, on the other hand was a tactile person. He needed to touch you and he needed to be touched. He needed to know that for all his rigid control, you were still there when everything went dark. Phil was snapped

A look of fear that Kate understood only too well crossed his face. ""Quickly!"" he said. She turned and fled down the stairs. He was being dissected alive. Unable to move, he was pinned down but conscious, desperately conscious. The surgeons reached into him and pulled out his organs, examining each one with curiosity. He roared with pain and struggled to move. He watched, soon they would reach something vital. With greedy hands the surgeons cast aside the organ they had been examining and reached in seeking something else. Fingers clutching under his ribcage for the heart.

He was hoping that nobody had noticed the growing tightness pressing out against his zipper, but let""s face it - this was a Vegas strip club and these were very attractive women. Nobody had noticed a damn thing. ""Are you taking us to Narnia or something?"" Matt finally breathed as she tugged him along towards the end of the corridor.

Dark wallpaper plastered the four walls and were dotted with a collage of neon signs, safety signs, and more trendy graffiti. By the far end of the room was a long, armless couch with two decorative pillows stacked against each other. For some reason, Matt found this comical - as if any man actually needed them. ""Cute,"" Matt drawled as he turned back to look at Karen, who had been hovering behind him the entire time. ""I could get used to it in here."" Well, that part had been mostly true. It was quieter.

Blasts of ice and cold shot forth from Blizzard""s hands, only to be met by two force blasts from the eyes of Joscota, which quickly cut through the ice and cold and sent Blizzard flying back hard, crashing into the wall. He quickly slumped to the floor unconcious. Boomerang quickly tossed two more boomerangs at Joscota, only to see her blast both of them from the air as well with her eye blasts. A third boomerang was tossed and Joscota quickly snatched it from the air and with an almost perfect precision throw, sent the boomerang flying back at Boomerang, who just barely managed to dodge. But he couldn""t dodge the metal fist that smacked him across the head next. ""Ouch!"", he whined as he fell to the ground, dazed and barely concious. ""Sometimes, the simpliest methods are the best"", Joscota thought to herself as she picked up the two unconcious men, looking for a containment unit in which to deposit and secure them. Quickly finding a proper cell, she deposited the two felons and moved on to locate and secure Control Central. _-_-_-_ BREAK _-_-_-_ The US Agent and nearly a dozen civilians were gathered in a small room, hidden down behind some overturned tables.

She replied and looked towards Georgina. ""Talking to Serena?' Georgina shot out at Jenny- who sighed. ""To find out how Eric is,' Jenny simply explained. She pushed the irritated feeling she got to the side. Georgina hated when any of them spoke to Serena, Blair or Nate. Truthfully Jenny would probably talk to them a lot more if Georgina wasn""t in the way. But they had all picked sides and Jenny aligned herself with Georgina. Which meant as irritating as her friend could be, she stayed away from Serena, Blair and Nate as much as she could. Georgina sighed and looked at the two of them. ""Dan best get here soon. You two are going to drive me crazy.' Georgina stated. ""That""s not possible, you""re already crazy.' A reply came from behind Georgina. She smiled and turned to face Dan. ""You have exceptional timing.' ""I do try,' he said and moved around Georgina. ""So why are they going to drive you crazy and how can I help them?'

Blair was busy talking to a college representative when she felt her phone go off. She then noticed a lot of other people checking their phones- which meant it could only have been a Gossip Girl post. A moment later she noticed people staring at her. She politely excused herself from her current conversation and moved away. She took her phone out and read the post. Anger immediately radiated through her body. She

Vulcan knocked him off, and the boy rolled away, quickly got to his feet and recovered his Tanto sword, as Vulcan coughed, rubbing his throat. The boy grit his teeth in anger holding his sword in offensive posture. Vulcan once again unsheathed his bayonet. ""Are we going to play this game again, boy? Tell me how Bryon Kelvin did it? Was that doctor also in on the plot to steal you away from your parents?"" ""Shut-up! My name is Number Six!"" But the boy appeared apprehensive, as if fighting to keep himself, Vulcan observed. He had only heard the story from Vincent about the brainwashed children under the twins control years prior, and over the years had not quite believed it, but with Lukas here now, he believed the story whole-heartedly. Bryon Kelvin had faked the boy""s death and then brainwashed him, turning Lukas into an assassin, after fixing his face. Then sent him to kill all the members of Vincent""s secret sect of aristocrats that mocked Kelvin from joining. He didn""t realize the old man had it in his blood, to be so cruel despite his kind-hearted façade and organizing and co-operating an orphanage for destitute, homeless children, whom Vulcan now realized were becoming his own personal, brainwashed army for some nefarious plot! ""Your name is Lukas Phantomhive, boy! Remember who you are!"" ""I AM NUMBER SIX!"" the boy shouted with such rigidity! ""YOU ARE LUKAS PHANTOMHIVE!"" Vulcan retorted with the same rigidity!

Text2: He wanted to believe that his return had been a complete success. In truth, while his mother beamed as he walked the halls and Butler stopped moodily pacing the grounds in search of something undiscoverable, Artemis Fowl II felt something was wrong. On paper, everything was even more perfect than before his trip to a very different type of Limbo. Scars gained in past adventures had disappeared, the headaches he hypothesized came from the memory wipe had ceased, and his two fingers on his left hand, swapped in one of the time travels, were restored to their rightful places. Artemis couldn""t put his finger on it (pardon the pun) but something still felt wrong. Not quite right. It had only been a few days since his return and he was still having trouble sleeping. Maybe because he had inhabited a place somewhere between sleep and death for the past six months that he was unable give into exhaustion or maybe it was the niggling feeling in the back of his mind that he had forgotten something. This was odd because Holly, an enemy-turned ally-turned friend-turned who knew anymore, had taken it upon herself to tell the story of their escapades. Her story telling techniques were admittedly weak and she was constantly contradicting herself and backtracking, but by the end of several hours worth of information, Artemis believed he had gotten everything straight. The main issue, of course, was that all these accounts were from Holly""s point of view. He had no idea what he had thought during these incidents. His personal journals had helped but they were all written in a dreadfully detached manner. The facts were all present but emotion and personal thought were nearly nonexistent.

""You mean the rich and famous Beverly Lucas couldn""t afford to buy her Rolls Royce brand new?"" Killian smirked. ""Absolutely she could, Swan. But she wrangled this one for far less than it was worth and despite her billions, I find she""s often naively pleased when she can acquire a bargain."" Emma frowned slightly. ""You must know her pretty well."" He frowned back, though his eyes remained fixed to the road. ""Aye."" ""Does Mrs. Lucas live on a dude ranch?"" Henry asked suddenly, demanding back his new friend""s attention. Emma almost laughed. ""What is a dude ranch, anyway?"" Killian answered Henry""s questions easily, as well as the next question, and the next. Emma felt her mind remove itself from their conversation, her focus returning to the bag. It looked like a standard grocery store package. There could have been any number of mundane things in it. It could have been Killian""s lunch. Her eyes roved over the bag, seeking any sort of hint as to what might be hiding in its flimsy, crinkled depths. Fortunately for her, the bag was flimsy, and Emma soon spotted a tear in the paper, near the top, along a side seam. At first, she had attributed her fixation on the bag to mean-spirited paranoia; Killian Jones wanted to keep his mystery bag a secret and she thought Killian Jones was a very annoying man. It seemed a fitting punishment to figure out what was in it. But once Emma found the rip, she decided her curiosity was her instincts warning her something was off... and was she ever glad she""d listened to them. Because poking out the rip, barely noticeable to someone who wasn""t looking, was the cold,

When she stood tall, Shrieker struck her from behind. Zakuro quickly executed her flash step to get away.

Everyone else was already in there, there was no doubt that Nagisa was trying his oh so hardest to get Rei to screw him. Aiichirou stepped around the small area blindly as he tried to locate the wall so that he could lean against it and settle his racing heart. He didn""t understand why he was so nervous; all he had to do was walk in, meet up with everyone else and stick with them!

Ellis said with less confidence, obviously shy. ""... I love you more, kid."" Nick replied with full confidence, he knew this had to be love... Even though he had been married once before he knew he had never really loved his ex-wife, but the way he felt about Ellis, Nick had no doubt that this was what love felt like. Even still, Ellis was surprised at Nick""s response, but nevertheless it made the younger male smile happily. He then nuzzled into Nick""s chest. ""Not possible.""

Cravings Ken looked around at the room before him, his eyes shifting from one place to another. It was utter chaos. Beside him, Davis was turning a crimson red out of embarassment. He started panicking, mumbling loudly to himself as he went into his room, fixing the mess known as his room. Ken stood there, motionless, watching, his face nuetral. His friend began to apologize over and over. ""I""m so sorry! When I invited you guys over, it never occured to me how badly my room looked!!""

Text2: Finally, slowly, Jen looked up at him. The lines around her mouth were pulled deep and taught; like they were on the few occasions he had seen her cry. A few stray wisps of soft brown hair strayed around the edges of her face, and a smear of dirt from some recent battle marred her cheek. Jen took his arm, with the full intention of removing it from her shoulder. However, when the time came to release it she found herself strangely unwilling. ""Thank you."" Wes said quietly. Until that time Wes had been openly and rapidly searching her entire face. At the same time Jen had been more surreptitiously glancing over his. And with those words their eyes met. There was a very long pause as neither of them wanted to look away. Tension rose quickly between them. They both knew it would eventually have to break, the only question was how. Frightened by how quickly old emotions had resurfaced, Jen almost wished that a phone would ring. Still, she didn""t pull away. Couldn""t pull away. She wanted to stay there with him. She wanted it more than anything. And then the tension snapped. In perfect sync they leaned together. Bodies and mouths locked and pure emotion swamped all reason and thought and judgment. Jen only dimly felt it when her back struck a thick tree trunk. Without hesitation they slid down it and fell onto the forested earth.

It was day five and this was the eighth planet they had been to. Ronon wanted to be anywhere but here; forced to listen to more dribble from people who only cared about the next transaction of fruit. He knew what it was like to be held prisoner, to fight and last in order to breathe freedom again. Sheppard was strong, fiercer on the inside than physical appearance would lead on which was his weapon. The colonel knew what it took to survive, able to come out alive from situations that would kill lesser men. Ronon also knew what it meant to be lost. It was one thing to stay alive, another to find your way back home. The darker side of his mind filled with the countless number of horrors that could be happening in a region of space that was a mere pinprick in the sky. And all he had done for his team leader was visit farmer""s markets and bazaars. ""Other people from the Ancient ring? You mean those who can fly?"" Ronon""s thoughts were interrupted by faint hope. ""Yes, other people who use flying ships. Have you ever traded with them?"" Teyla asked in a calm, neutral matter. Ronon felt his muscles coil and tighten. ""Maybe,"" the trader hedged.

""Eh, few days, but I gotta get going after we kick some Narutard ass."" Kiba grinned, leaning against the door. ""Any chance I could sneak a peak at that wreck-in-progress?"" Kankuro smirked, leaning forward a bit. Shino glared at Kiba and Gaara gave his older brother a questioning glance. ""Sure, why not?"" Kiba instantly responded, when the door opened again, hitting Kiba in the back. Temari glared at Kiba and moved aside to let Hinata in. The woman sighed as she adjusted a strap of her stiff chest guard under the short white cloak around her shoulders, white streamers streaked with black hanging from twin triangular points on her back. The white molded chest armor was a definite change from her form-hiding clothes, sturdy cloth pinning the pale blue weave to her sides. Finding that perfect balance, Hinata lowered her hands out, letting the front flaps settle over her chest and the long sleeves slide over her hands. The streamers fluttered at the slightest movement, appearing to curl around her when she remained still. ""Sorry to make you wait, but maybe we should leave before Naruto-sama gets too impatient?""

And Gaara knew that if he could feel anything now, anything other than this damn consistent numbness, it should be fear. But yet he couldn""t. The room was wide, the floors a smooth jade, the walls lined with ivory pillars. And in the middle of it all sat Chiyo, atop her ivory throne.

But he was a normal guy back then, with normal hopes and dreams, and normal fears too. What a lot of people seem to forget is that it was back then, when he was weak an helpless, that he dove on top of a grenade. He knew that it would kill him, that it would be painful if he lived long enough to feel it, but he overcame those fears faster than the other guys (the soldiers, the guys twice his size and three times his weight, the ones who were stronger and faster and better-) ran for cover. Being brave had nothing to do with how strong you were. It was far easier, after all, to be fearless with a gun in your hand. Or in his case, a serum. Bit more drastic than any gun, and it had so far proven a lot more effective. Everything that happened during the war - the rescues, his so-called heroics, that final mission - could he really be called fearless with such an advantage on his side? Not that any of it was easy - he wouldn""t disgrace the lives lost by saying that - but could he have done any of that without the serum? (everything special about you comes out of a bottle) No. He almost laughed at the mental image of himself, the scrawny pre-serum Steve trying to do any of that. The amusement was quickly drained from him though. Erskine had chosen him, had seen something in him, had decided to give him a chance when no one else would. But what if he""d chosen wrong? There had to be guys who were better than him, who were special.

Not many computer programmers are their world champions wrestling team""s MVP two years running, apparently."" ""That""s awesome man, but ya didn""t answer my question. Why ya here?"" Auggie seized up for a second. He really didn""t want to answer that question. It was more personal than he felt comfortable with, even if he already felt more trusting than usual toward his chatty roomie. ""You ask a lot of questions, you know,"" Auggie deflected.

It couldn""t be. Who would do this to her? But unfortunately she recognised the smashed vases and the broken picture frames and she was pretty sure that the papers floating around were from the journals she had kept as a child. Her breath caught and tears started to flow down her cheeks. It wasn""t much. It was only enough to really keep Lily but it was her home. The place where she should feel safe. Where she was sheltered from the media and the press and the criminals. Her home was supposed to be her sanctuary and suddenly this had been ripped from her without a care. She slid silently to the ground, leaning against the open front door way. How long she stayed like that, just staring at her ransacked house, she did not know. Eventually though, Scorpius came to find her...apparently she had been ignoring his calls. Damn that muggle device - she always forgot to charge it. But Scorpius understood the situation immediately. Her entire life, Lily had struggled with the fame that her family had to suffer through.

Danny put both of his hands together and started forming a ball of green ectoplasmic energy in between his palms. He started charging up the blast, and in just a few moments, he unleashed it and fired a ray of bright green light at the cloaked figure. The cloaked figured guarded by putting out his hands. When he did so, a black shield-like force field popped up in front of him. The energy hit the force field and was completely absorbed. ""I thought you""d do better than that,"" the cloaked figure taunted after just foiling Danny""s first attack. ""What?"" Danny asked. Before he gave the cloaked figure an opportunity to answer, he flew up to him and started firing a series of punches at him. The punches hit the cloaked figure every single time and he never got an opportunity to defend himself. Danny kept pummeling away until the cloaked figure finally put his arms out and put a giant black sphere around himself. The black sphere sent Danny hurling backwards through the air. It felt like he had just been pushed away by a brick wall. He continued flying backwards until he landed back-flat on a random door that was floating around. Danny tried to recover, and when he regained his senses, he saw that the cloaked figure was not attacking him at all. The cloaked figure was just floating there with his arms crossed and giving Danny what appeared to be a cold look. ""Have I proven myself yet?"" the cloaked figure asked. ""Yeah,"" Danny admitted. He promptly fired another blast of energy at the cloaked figure. He caught the figure off guard, and as a result,

Small fireballs erupted from his mouth towards various bandits, most of whom dodged with ease. Sensing one close-by, Sasuke tried a spinning kick to take the foe out. The Uchiha succeeded in nicking the bandit with his foot, but otherwise missed. He reached for his kunai pouch only to realize he no longer had one. Cursing, he jumped backwards and half-way activated his Cursed Seal. ""What the-"" One of the bandits said when Sasuke had appeared in a flash with his leg in the bandit""s stomach.

She rolled her head to the side gazing at him through half closed eyelids, ""Is that an invitation?' He snorted, pushing himself up off the couch and offering her his hand, ""Come on then.' His fingers were warm as she accepted the help and once standing a smile settled on her face as his arms slipped around her waist guiding them to the bedroom.

He was an excellent driver, better than most professional racers, and a flat tire would not be enough to send him careening over the edge of the cliff on its own. The projected loss of control would be brief, and expertly handled. That was where the truck came in, going too fast for so narrow a road. The driver was running behind schedule, held up by last minute changes in the delivery location, rushing. He was not used to navigating such treacherous lanes, and his cargo shifted and buckled with each turn, unbalancing the vehicle. The Winter Soldier inhaled, and with the next exhale, squeezed the trigger. The car swerved as the truck came around the narrow turn. He did not hear her scream, or see Stark spin the wheel. He did not stay to ensure the work was done. If he had missed, they would arrange another attempt, at another time and place. The Winter Soldier never missed. He did not feel remorse, his hands never shook. So he did not understand why he felt cold and sick that day as he packed up and left the site. Why he could so easily imagine Stark""s face when it had been so far away on the other side of the scope. Why he could not decide whether it made it better or worse that he had not watched their final moments.

Her colleague had actually intended to express her deepest condolences, which unexpectedly took Lizzy by the most horrific surprise. Indeed, she had noticed that Mr. Houston did not come to see her anymore, but she presumed this was due to her decline of his marriage proposal. In fact, she was initially relieved at his absence, since it had been her decision - albeit a painful one - to dissociate herself from him, at least for awhile. When she heard the dreadful news, she was stricken with immense grief. She refused to believe it was about her beloved clerk, until her colleague showed her the chronicle the day after that, of which the descriptions unmistakably pointed to Mr. Houston.

But the demonstrations were orchestrated to appear within the lighted windows through which Will saw most clearly. There were yet many narrow, unlit hallways leading to these windowed rooms. While Hannibal had granted Will the power to observe in the piecemeal way to which he was accustomed, he was not allowed to see until they stood together in Garrett Jacob Hobbs"" kitchen in Minnesota that each blazing pane belonged to the same structure. By then, the path had been laid, and needed only to be followed.

When everything fell back into focus, he saw that he was sitting in bed within a bedroom that was decorated in an antique style. Out the window, Harry could see the sun slowly starting to rise. How long had he been out? Harry slowly climbed out of bed and headed for the door. He grabbed the handle and tried to turn it but it would not budge. He tried again and again with no success. He threw his hands up in frustration and turned back toward the bedroom. On the bed, Harry noticed, was a set of wizard robes. They were the color green in the exact same shade of Slytherin house and when Harry approached them he saw that there was silver embroidery and the Slytherin house crest was sewn to the front. There was a note lying on top of the robes and Harry picked it up. Welcome back, Potter, These are for you.

""Clearly not,"" said Crookshanks angrily. ""Okay,"" sighed Orville. ""If you say so."" Emily decided now was the time to comfort Orville. She did so by chewing out Crookshanks. ""Orville is still but a child. You may not like him, but he""s trying his hardest. You should be ashamed of yourself for treating him in such an undignified manner. I thought you were all about being dignified, but clearly not. Is this the example you want to set for your newborns?"" Crookshanks knew she had lost this round, mainly because acromantulas are much bigger than her and she didn""t want to turn this minor disagreement into an all-out brawl. She wasn""t sorry, but she knew when the gig was up. And then, Flynn hooted because he was still there too, perched in his place as always. Several weeks had passed since Crookshanks had given birth. Orville had spent this time trying to get to know the kitteneazles, which were about as friendly as their mother. He had also spent this time getting to know Emily, who was in fact quite friendly. As far as Orville was concerned, Emily was the best sort of friend a cowpig could have. Emily didn""t think quite as highly of Orville, but she certainly didn""t mind him either, and compared to the rest of the farm animals he was easily the least offensive. Throughout these weeks, Ginny had been visiting regularly. Sometimes she let Orville out of his box to play for a while, because Xenophilius changed the spell so that any human could open the box, but on Lovegood""s orders, she had to lock him back up afterward.

Text2: ""Now you are on my boat Jack Sparrow and I can shoot you without having an explosion! You fool!"" But Jack Sparrow also had a gun which was his secret weapon and he took it out of his gun pocket and pointed it and aimed it at James and James saw it and was frightened because now it hard turned into a standoff. And what a standoff it was! It was incredible, but there was no action because it was a standoff and that means not doing anything. The standoff lasted two days and two nights and they both became very hungry for food and since they were on a boat the hunger almost turned into scurvy, except it luckily didn""t. Then Commodore James Norrington conked out. ""At last, I do believe I have the upper hand!"" said Jack and he whispered it super quiet so he wouldn""t wake up the Commodore. Then he boarded back onto his own boat which didn""t float away during the two days because it had an anchor. So he took out the anchor and drove his boat finally and drove his boat to Port Royale. Before he got there he had to go over many miles and kilometers of the ocean and it was very far but he got there just fine. When he got there he delivered the gunpowder in the shipment to its recipient. It took a long time because it was in lots of barrels and he didn""t have a handcart. He didn""t spill any. But he thought about what Commodore James told him. ""He even had a chart."" he considered. ""Maybe the good Commodore Jim was right and I am still a filthy pirate scum.""

""He has a point,"" Brennan remarked, turning to Booth. ""There is no rational reason for you to call me Bones even if I do work with bones. It would seem-"" ""No lectures this weekend, Bones, please,"" Booth told her, holding up a hand to stop the flow of words coming from her mouth. Surprisingly, she stopped talking. ""So, Seeley, it""s been awhile since you brought a girl home,"" Maddie remarked, sweeping her thick, curly hair out of her face. Though Brennan could see the similarities between her and the Booth boys, she definitely bore a stronger resemblance to her mother. ""It certainly has. I was beginning to wonder if you would ever settle down,"" Jack remarked, pushing himself out of his chair to approach the threesome (for Parker had rejoined his father and ""Dr. Bones""). ""Can we please not discuss this now, Dad?"" Booth pleaded, glancing nervously at Brennan. He knew her feelings about marriage very well. Luckily, she appeared not to understand what his father was talking about; her face had not yet adopted the expression that he knew portended a lecture about how marriage was nothing more than an archaic ritual designed to prevent women from ever being able to achieve anything. Booth was not ready for that argument yet. He wanted Brennan to make a good impression on his family first so that maybe they would realize that one of the greatest things about her was her unique quirks, just as he had done. ""Temperance Brennan. I recognize that name,"" Hilary said thoughtfully. ""Wait a second, you""re not the Temperance Brennan who writes the mystery novels, are you? ""I am,"" Brennan confirmed.

Text2: ""What makes you say that?"" Lily questioned. James nodded toward the badge which she had pinned in a prominent position on her robe. She glanced down at it before looking back up at him to see that he had a similar badge which he had bewitched to float slightly above his head, revolving slowly. ""You couldn""t just pin it to your robe like a normal person?"" Lily inquired irritably. ""Nah, too cliché."" James smiled that cocky smile that made Lily wish to punch him. ""I was thinking of enlarging it, but Padfoot thought that might be overdoing it a bit."" ""So, who""d you nick it from?"" ""So cynical, Evans."" ""I""m just being realistic. Dumbledore would have to be crazy to appoint you Head Boy."" ""That seems to be the common consensus lately."" ""I""m not going to sit here and listen to this! I""m going to put my stuff away!"" ""I""ll see you in a bit, Evans. We have to lead the prefect""s meeting."" Lily let out a groan as she stormed off to the first two carriages which were reserved for prefects. She could not believe her horrid luck. Ever since her first year at Hogwarts, she had hoped to become Head Girl. She would be allowed out in the corridors at all hours of the night. She would have the respect of all the other students (or most of them-the Slytherins being the obvious exception). She had authority, and others looked to her for guidance. Best of all, she received her own dormitory and a common room she only had to share with the Head Boy. ""A Head Boy who just happens to be Potter,' a nasty voice in the back of her head reminded her.

I""ve tried everything! It""s as if today is Topsy Turvy Day! Flustered he slams his hands onto the table giving it a good shake. A globe teetering on the edge falls over and crashes on the floor. A dark portal appears before North, but there are no images on the other side. Surprised, he quickly stands up and backs away from the portal. Curiosity soon gets the best of him as he carefully walks closer towards it. Focused on what this portal entails, he is unaware of a roller skate lying by it. ""How strange. I wonder..."" He reaches up to touch it, but accidently steps on the skate instead. ""Whoa!"" Stumbling forward he falls directly into the portal. A flash fills the room as the portal closes. A knock at door is left unanswered, forcing the yeti to enter. Looking around, he scratches his head when there is no sign of North. While looking for any signs of his boss, the unexpected feeling of wetness underneath his foot forces him to look down. He is surprised to a see a broken snow globe lying on the floor so carelessly.

I climbed down the ladder and ran home, even if it was 90 degrees out with extreme humidity. I busted through the doorway, noticing that all the Cobras had left. I then ran up into my room, grabbing my sleeping bag and stuffing my flashlight in it. I grabbed all the change off of my dresser, which was only about 50 cents.

It may be chilly and overcast, but it will not stop her from finally doing the Sydney Harbour bridge climb. The first time they were here half a year ago, Bruce mocked the hell out of her for wanting to do something so tame. To his credit, he rented a Cessna and flew her over it instead, but before that happened, she had to shoot down his suggestion to get wingsuits and land on top of it, or at least fly circles around it. She might concede that the idea of wingsuits, which seemed nuts to her in her pre-Rio hang-gliding days, might have some merit after all, but her argument of which part of becoming an instant media magnet interfering with the whole being dead thing do you fail to grasp was nonetheless perfectly sensible. Now, with Bruce conveniently out of the way, she is walking up that bridge, no two ways about it. ""Sure."" He sounds a bit disappointed. ""When are you going to the bar?"" ""About eight.""

How fortunate for me that a third should turn up as well."" She walked over to where Maul was breathing heavily as he tried to compensate for the loss of the Force. ""Hmm, this one seems to be damaged."" One of the guards approached Maul with a medi kit but as he was reaching out to examine the wound Maul bent down and bit into his hand. The guard yelped in pain and a flurry of armed men stormed into the room and attacked Maul with the buts of their rifles. Then to restrain him, manacles were brought in and he was chained to the wall. ""Better restrain these two as well."" Kala added, and the Jedi were caught by the wrists and manacled loosely. As a restrained Maul was tended to, Kala moved to stand before Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. ""What do you mean to do with us!?"" Demanded Obi-Wan. ""Ah my dear boy, do you not understand? I am a slave trader, and you three are the tradees. I assure you that at this stage, the young queen will have reached Coruscant and your gamble will be forgiven. In return for this favour I have granted you, all I ask is your cooperation. It will take us at least three days to reach our destination."" ""What is our destination?"" Obi-Wan asked.

""Well, whatever it was for, it looks like you should put something on it."" He rifled through his pockets and conjures up a jar of ointment. ""This is a balm made from aloe vera, rose hip and some other fiddly plants that should help with healing the skin."" Castiel stared at the small pot with the blank expression of someone who cannot fathom the reasons for being handed a pot of balm. Crowley eventually tired of getting stared at and tossed it to the angel who caught it smoothly in one hand. Supernatural reflexes not quite exhausted. ""It""s not poisonous."" He told the angel. ""You can test it on the tall one if you like, see if he breaks out in hives or not."" Cas examined the jar and Crowley took a moment to look around at the room they had placed him in. Like so much of the Singer residence it was filled with books and boxes and thick layers of dust. If the angel was truly human he hoped he would be spared the various bronchial problem likely to be developed living in such unkempt surroundings. Perhaps he should arrange for his old house maid to pay them a visit. ""What are you doing here, Demon?"" There was that self-righteous tone only the truly blessed could pull off.

Text2: By the trembling of Yumie""s hands as she held the katana, it was obvious that the action had also affected her as well. Some of the lust of blood had receded from her eyes as well, but Seras knew too well that these people - Iscariot members - didn""t give up so easily when it came to dealing with abominations. It was a wonder that this Yumie or Yumiko wasn""t a regenerator like Anderson. Her insanity had potential. Grimacing, the blonde rose from floor on shaky legs. With her weapon gone and her hands damaged, for the moment, Seras was defenseless and almost as weak as she had been when she was human. Curses. If she died, Seras wasn""t positive that Alucard wasn""t going to follow her to hell just to berate her for eternity. ""Still up, filth?"" Yumie seethed venomously, curling her palms tighter around the hilt of her sword. ""It seems I actually didn""t give you enough credit. You""re stronger than most of your sinner kind. Just like your sire."" The smile she offered Seras was almost scathing. ""Though it won""t matter soon because he will be nothing more than dust."" Yes, that""s right. Bait her. Taunt her. She is weak despite her apparent strength. Yumie laughed deeply, almost like she knew something Seras didn""t. ""The Paladin will scatter his body into the winds and then he will make sure that the bitch that rules this place is no more than a memory."" The vampire was silent but Yumie saw her eyes darkening in shade and changing in texture. Despite the pain coursing through her arms, Yumie forced herself to act casually. She leaned her sword against her shoulder, watching the young woman with uninterested eyes. ""It was so easy to get past your defenses..."" Seras tensed almost","{""output"": ""NO""}"

""You constantly insult me rather than be decent."" ""That""s just how I am."" ""That""s what I don""t understand."" ""What?"" Somehow, she managed to break away from his yellow eyes and turn her attention back to the people in the distance, blissfully unaware that two demons from the fiery pits of hell were watching them. The thought made her smile internally. ""You claim you want everyone to love you and accept you. And yet... you push people who do want to be close to you, away."" ""What can I say? I""m a complicated guy."" he replied arrogantly. ""No, it""s not that. It""s just plain stupid."" He shot her a questioning look as a smile graced her face. ""I don""t think I""ve made you do that before."" he teased lightly. ""Come on."" She looked at him for a moment before he ushered her a way from the ledge. She still stared at him unsurely as he placed his left hand around her waist while grasping her hand in his stone fist. ""Really?' she asked skeptically. ""What? You saying you can""t dance?"" he smiled. She smiled at him with a raised eyebrow. When she received her slightly reassuring look, he swung her out before pulling her back in. The look on her face was enough to make Hellboy laugh. He actually laughed. It was actually slightly unnerving for Ann Marie. With that, the two of the proceeded to dance, albeit badly, laughing like children until the music finally came to a halt.

She glowered at the man that wasn""t looking up at her, but continued regardless. ""My scars are still pulling pretty bad and I feel sore. Everything kind of hurts no matter what I do unless I just sit there."" ""Um-hm."" He said again before finally meeting her stare. He continued to smile kindly. ""How do you feel right now?"" ""Fine for the most part."" She answered, knowing he probably thought she was a junkie looking for meds to score. ""I stretched too far earlier so my side still hurts a little, but fine I guess.""

His wife loved keeping on a schedule, but if she was too wrapped up in a book, she was likely unable to keep track of time. He walked out to the hallway that led him to the library. He saw Owlowicious on a perch near the table. ""Good morning, Owlowicious. Can you tell me where I can find my wife?"" Owlowicious hooted and tilted his head to a bookcase. Flash got the gist as he pushed back an empty chair and the bookcase revealed a secret passage. There, Twilight was on a couch reading peacefully until she looked up to see the passage was wide open.

It was dry and parched, scorched by the unforgiving sun that hung low and foreboding in the western sky. He shifted the hoe from one hand to the other flexing tired muscles generously as he reached the end of the current row. This life of scraping a meager existence off this hell forsaken land would not have been so bad, if only... he shot a despairing glance over his shoulder. The earth curled beneath his boots grasping at the smooth dearskin as he made his way to the well. It sat dissolutely at the edge of his property, sunk between the valley of two hills. Scooping up the bucket he let it slide effortlessly down the length of the rope into the bleak depths of the stone prison. He stared out into the sunset as he raised it, and then taking a swift drink of the cool liquid he cursed softly beneath his breath. The dark shape of a castle, its spires rising up to pierce the sky, smeared the glorious pinks, tarnished the golden hues and beckoned with outstretched palms at the peaks of its towers to the night. It stood a constant reminder of the heavy taxes, the overbearing laws, and the unethical system of justice. Within its depths the haughty king sat, perhaps counting his gold, perhaps deciding which prisoners to hang on the morrow. A lump formed in his throat that not even the gulps of soothing water could dislodge. He turned away from the slipping rays of warmth and the cold stone that blocked them from their full potential and stocked back to his hoe.","{""output"": ""NO""}"

He had been lucky this time to have the tower for himself but Tony knew his luck was not that good certainly not when it came to matters like this. STONY Steve was tired. Then again, it was always tiring having to deal with bureaucrats. Technically he should still have a few days left but thanks to Agent Coulson, Steve got to go home a few days earlier than expected. He was looking forward to a few days of calmness and privacy, not having to play the golden boy in front of the media. Steve was impatiently waiting for the elevator to take him up to the living-quarter level of Stark tower. There was the soft ping of the door when it opened and just as he was about to step out of the elevator he was hit with the scent of an omega in heat. The blonde haired captain was not usually affected by it but this time it felt different, the scent was also unusually familiar, Steve was sure of it. This in itself was weird as there were no omegas at Stark tower and the fact that SHIELD did not hire omegas, only alphas and betas. Also, considering the fact that no one was supposed to be home, at least to his knowledge. He was not overly fond of how affected he was by the sweet scent

She hadn""t said a word throughout the service, silenced by grief, and no one had attempted to draw her out of it. Completing the grave ensemble was a man, a late-arrival who stood a little way back from the others. He was bundled up against the weather in a heavy black greatcoat, a scarf wrapped around the lower half of his face and a formal hat pulled down low over his eyes. One of his arms was held against his body in a plaster cast and sling, the undamaged hand in his pocket, suggesting an attitude of casualness, but out of the quartet, he seemed the most intent upon the priest""s words.

""I""m still pissed at you for nearly killing Raven, though."" Beast Boy said and Jinx nodded. ""I had a feeling that you would be, because I don""t expect you to forgive me. Not now or even later, I just wanted to explain."" Jinx said carefully. The H.I.V.E. left soon after that and Beast Boy finally changed into a new uniform and put on his emergency gloves, then left his room. Beast Boy knew that he had a long night ahead of him. He was going to go to the medical bay and stay with Raven until she woke up. He looked over at Raven""s door. ""I wonder if Raven would want to hear me read one of her books to her."" Beast Boy wondered out loud as he walked over and opened the door. He stood in the doorway and peered into the darkness Beast Boy clicked the light switch and imagined

Now, it was the responsibility of the individual to go to the basement and do laundry. At the moment, Quistis was wearing flannel pyjamas. It was the pant and shirt kind, not a nightgown.

During the Sorceress War, she had bought several pairs since they kept getting broken. Her friends had urged her to wear contacts, but Quistis didn""t want to bother with having to put them in every morning just to take them out again at night. As for laser eye surgery... well, there was a definite fear of unknown side effects there. A long, rattling sigh escaped between two cracked lips. Certain she looked a mess while soaking wet and with her hair down, Quistis had tried to avert the glances in her direction she had received on her walk back to her dorm. For a moment, she wished that she were still a student, having a roommate that she could discuss her problems with. It had been so long since she had become a SeeD, Quistis couldn""t even remember who her roommate had been or what she looked like. Someone knocked at the door and she stood

There wasn""t a boom or anything, more like a flash and a bunch of blue smoke. Yuffie coughed a few times, waving her hands around to try and clear up the place. What she saw when it cleared was the last thing she expected, though. What she expected was the place to be a complete mess. What she saw, though, was a hole in the wall. Well, not really a hole in the wall itself. It actually looked like a world""s keyhole, but this keyhole didn""t lead to the heart of the world: it lead to another world altogether. It was a...Yuffie pulled the book back out of her pocket again and looked at the cover. Two words stuck out to her: a dimension gate. Surely, if the ways to other worlds could be up in outer space, there could be some in the worlds themselves? Tucking the book back in her pocket, Yuffie wondered if she should tell someone else about this... ""Nah! Why let them have all the fun?' she thought, and climbed through the keyhole. At first, she thought she had just woken up from a daydream and nothing had happened. She was still standing in a dirty old shack. Except, when she looked over her shoulder, there was the dimension gate, and she still held the book. Cautiously, she crept across the empty room to a dirty window, and wiped it off to look out at this new world she had found. She had to say, she was actually disappointed. The view she had was from a high cliff, overlooking a small town in a canyon. To the right, the canyon stretched

Text2: In fact, a popular source of gossip in the Jade Mermaid was comparing pirates and agreeing on who would be the most likely to be the first to storm the bay. And that was what was going on currently, all around the inside of the tavern. Boomstick Luke plopped down at a table with his partners, Hellfire Russell and Pointer Wesley, slapping down the drinks he""d brought. For some reason, every pirate either had a nickname, a title, or an insult attached to them. Otherwise, they were referred to as ""cabin boy scum"" or some other similar degrading stereotypes. Hellfire was a giant of a man, a long eared dog who was famous for the cannon he carried on his shoulder in replacement of more convenient weapons. However, not all of his bulk was fat, as was proved by the ease with which he could swing said cannon like a club. Pointer was a tiny little thing, with pointy ears and a twitch in one eye that creeped people out. However, he was fast, too fast for anyone else to touch him, and was deadly proficient with the rapier he had in his belt. Boomstick, however, was right in the middle, neither tall nor short, neither fat nor skinny. Most of the time, he fought with two cutlasses, which often was enough, but other times he""d have to fall back on his scattergun. Hence, the nickname. Boomstick leaned back in his chair before saying ""Right, where were we again?"" Pointer piped up here with ""Trying to think about which snot-nosed cabin boy what calls hisself a pirate would be able to get through the harbor without getting hisself blown to pieces."" Hellfire nodded before saying ""I think you brought up someone, Boomstick. Who was ""e again? Capper? Copper?"" ""Cooper,"" corrected","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""Funny thing for a girl who ran away in a madman""s magic box to say,"" he says instead, but even as he""s speaking, a memory of the look on her digitized face as she cried out I don""t know where I am flashes through his mind.

""But you don""t know where you are. Here, now, in the TARDIS. I could""ve parked us anywhere. Doesn""t that scare you?"" ""Nope.""

Consider this a generous warning."" He smiled kindly, leaning back. ""Th-this is an outrage! I-I will not stand here and be insu-insulted like this!""

Kanon excused himself, bowing. However, it was apparent that he was more concerned with having upset his Lord than his own well being. Schneizel paused, looking at the bowing young man for a few seconds before sighing ""Kanon, please raise your head. I was only teasing you."" He explained tiredly. ""Of course, my Lord.""

But right now pork noodles were what he really wanted to eat. They were just as good as they were last night and Kuroko wolfed them down. Setting the dishes in the sink. He saw that there was starting to be a slight buildup of dirty dishes. He had nothing better to do, he began to clean them. It took less time than expected. He looked around the house for anything to do. Making a mental note to pick up another hobby besides basketball, reading, and hanging around Kagami. He went back up to the bedroom to get ready.

After explaining the single he was going to mention the band""s name so he is sure she will bring it up then. ""It was a demo for Homeless Fairies. We were going to put it on the album but Shuichi decided Make Over would be a better choice. The song is about how anyone can feel on top of the world if they""re in the right friendship group and have the right relationship and I used the theatre and fame as a metaphor in the song. A week before I wrote the show I got an offer to play Raoul in The Phantom of The Opera. Because I was so busy I had to sadly turn it down. But after I left the band, the same company offered me the leading role and I accepted it."" ""So you made the right choice there,"" Misaka said. ""Now you already have two albums already why did you leave it until now to release the demo as an official single?"" ""It""s one of my favorite songs I""ve ever recorded. So I wanted to save the best till later one. And In My Theatre didn""t seem to blend in with my two previous albums, which are both very solid classical albums. This single has a more rocky approach to it.

He was married to the Spanish princess for twenty-four years, and for at least twenty of them, it was a happy and successful marriage. Then he tore his country apart for Anne Boleyn and after only three years of marriage, she was beheaded for adultery and witchcraft. All of the accusations against Anne were false and fabricated by Cromwell, but at the same time, Cromwell was strictly following orders from His Majesty. Nobody would dare disobey His Majesty. Both Anne and Catherine were unlucky when it came to their fertility. Their only surviving offspring were daughters, so Henry believed that if they were capable of having healthy daughters, by God""s grace boys should follow. But it wasn""t to be, and Henry had grown sick and tired of still born babies and miscarriages. Neither Catherine nor Anne deserved to die the way they did. They were both strong and faithful women right through to the very end. It only made him more determined to ensure that Jane was protected from any harm. He even reminded Jane of Anne""s fate, and although he sounded threatening, he only wanted to protect Jane. And if Jane gave Henry a son, he knew that Jane would be protected from any dangers in England. He found her modesty and obedience a breath of fresh air to a world of pain. Jane were the flowers blossoming in a war field. Henry needed a male heir to secure the throne, and with regret his daughters were declared bastards, but Jane was brave enough to suggest that Mary should be restored to the succession to the throne.

Her breath was ragged. Her eyes were fixed on her feet and her face seemed a few shades paler than normal. ""Are you okay?"" Lily asked, noting the appearance of her friend. Audrey nodded her head and looked up to face Lily. Their eyes made contact and Audrey quickly dropped her head like a guilty child who had just broken her mother""s favorite vase.

Poisoning led to other kinds of murders and from there it was - off to the races. Despite his dislike of ordinary people, Sherlock found that their tedious attempts at villainy still interested him. Crimes were like puzzles, and best of all they were puzzles that could often be solved using his old passion for noticing things. It seemed that other people, after all these years, had still never learned to see the things which were obvious to Sherlock: the precise type of cigarettes smoked by a suspect, for example, either by the difference in aromas between the brands, or by the type of ash left, or by their remnants left at the scene. Sherlock discovered to his great pleasure that all of his childhood fascinations were still filed away somewhere, not deleted after all, merely set side in indefinite storage. Buried with the half-recollected sight of the dead pigeon, its head clearly crushed by - as young Sherlock had easily deduced - impact with the brick wall. He had always read the papers but now he found himself reading though them, solving them before he got to the end. The Carl Powers case came up when Sherlock was eighteen; he knew that Carl had been murdered, but the police wouldn""t listen to a teenage chemistry student. Sherlock would make them listen, someday. He decided he would become a Consulting Detective. He had invented the position himself. Perhaps it was the only remnant of those tedious schoolboy morals: Be of Service. Respect the Queen. It was irritating but inescapable that the pabulum served up when Sherlock was young and credulous was

But even though he knew this chainsaw was familiar, even knew exactly how he would deploy it in future fights, there was no flash or insight into when he had used it before, or what he had started using it to begin with. It was his though, he knew that for a certainty. He looked at the bed where Sabin lay for a long moment before he dropped his head into his

I didn""t know how much use we could really be if they decided to come get him in force, but thus far they seemed to keep their distance if he was with us.

""Our Quartermaster, every Quartermaster uses the code name Q,"" Eve explained as she continued to walk down the hallway. ""Actually, why don""t we go there next? Q Branch is often in need of translations."" The two women entered the room and all Piper could hear was the frantic typing of keyboards. She""d never seen so many computers in one place. ""Moneypenny!"" an older man called, raising his hand to her. ""I""ll be right back,"" Eve said to Piper before walking away. Piper stood nervously, unsure what to do with herself. She looked back at Eve who was deep in conversation. After much internal debate, she decided to look around the Q Branch. She wandered aimlessly, observing the various agents working away. She was in awe at their immense knowledge of technology. She spent so much time with old books that she occasionally forgot about how advanced the world really was. She eyed one computer at the front of the room, facing the others. She assumed that this was the head of the branch""s computer. Running her hand along the smooth white surface of the desk, she couldn""t help but smile. She was really here, at MI6. Mum would""ve been so proud. She picked up a mug from the desk. She noticed a Scrabble tile on the side. She smirked when she saw it was a Q. ""This guy must really like his code name,"" she thought to herself. ""Piper!"" she heard Eve call her name. She turned quickly, placing the mug back down on the desk. Eve walked towards her, and Piper noticed she wasn""t alone. Beside her was

The doorknob slid out of her grip again and she glanced over her shoulder, lifting aquestioning eyebrow at him. ""Yes?"" He took his glasses off and pinched the bridge of his nose before looking at her. ""You weren""t quite yourself today. Are you sure everything is all right? You know you can talk to me, don""t you?"" She nearly laughed at the irony of it all. What was she supposed to say? ""No, nothing""s alright, because I saw you and your best friend""s widow kissing in the garage, and I wish like hell I hadn""t seen any of this, because it hurt and I still love you and...' His voice brought her back to reality again. ""Sam?"" She hadn""t noticed that she had been staring at a spot on the wall opposite her and that he was now standing directly in front of her. Close. Too close for comfort. ""Fine, I""m fine!"" she stuttered quickly and cursed the tone her voice had adapted in that moment. He opened his mouth to say something, but she cut him off. ""I""m fine!"" she said again hastily before turning on her heel and nearly running out of his office.

""Those will be very helpful. They open all kinds of doors in case you need to leave through the back"". Seraph nodded. Keys to open back doors in the Matrix. A passport to travel through the Matrix with more ease and speed. He nodded his thanks and rose. The Oracle rose with him and saw him to the doorway of the kitchen. ""Seraph? It""s cold out there. Look after yourself"". Seraph bowed and exited the flat. Outside it was snowing, and he gathered his loose white shirt around his chest, not to protect against the cold, but to allow himself to slip the key chain into one voluminous sleeve. The park was quiet with the falling snow, and white mounds had covered the green grass. Seraph vaulted over the closed gates, and walked through the trees undisturbed. Though the air was freezing, Seraph felt not the cold. He reached a small clearing, peaceful in its icy serenity. The garden would have looked like this in winter. Then discord struck the peace. SMITH ""Their fatal hands No second stroke intend. "" - Paradise Lost. (bk. II. 712) It had been worth the wait after all. Seraph alone in a deserted clearing, no interfering humans to gawp and point. Not that engaging in often fatal combat in front of the unplugged humans had ever been an issue for Smith. In all else excluding combat, Smith was the personification of subtlety. Every word, every smooth gesture was calculated, never dramatic or obvious. Agent Smith was minimalist when it came to expressing himself. He was not here to induce camaraderie or other such sickly links with

""A foolish question, dearie, for one so fond of tales. Use your imagination"" Belle closed her open mouth, resignation fuelling her pragmatism and bit her lip before addressing him again. ""I take it that means you won""t help me down?"" His manic giggle floated away down the stairs. Belle huffed, half in exasperation and half in amusement. Sunlight poured down in a mosaic of colour.

He climbed into the car, shut the roof, and then drove off. ""Alfred, anything unusual on the Batwave?"" Bruce asked into a communicator. ""Let""s have a look,"" came Alfred""s voice from the other end of the line. ""Would the discovery of several mammals found completely drained of blood qualify?"" ""Langstrom couldn""t have used fruit bats?"" Batman muttered under his breath. ""That ""Dracula""s lair"" joke of yours isn""t so funny anymore, Batman,"" said Dan. ""Begging your pardon, sirs?"" said Alfred. ""Let""s just say I""m no longer the only bat in town,"" said Batman. ""You seeing that?"" Dan asked suddenly, pointing to the left-hand side of the car. In the air, silhouetted against the full moon, was a giant man-sized bat. ""Am now,"" said Batman. He turned the Batmobile down that direction and drove until they were practically right under Man Bat, then started driving after him. It was then that both heroes noticed that he was flying right toward a balcony on which stood a man with a telescope. Probably a stargazer, Dan surmised. Still, the man was in danger, so they had to act before Man Bat could go full vampire on an actual human being. Batman swerved the Batmobile to a stop, opened it up, and both heroes got out. Batman shot his grappling hook up to a building, and Dan opened his staff. It was some sort of Glider, Batman could see. The fabric was

Morgana-san made a sound with his tongue as he jumped over Sakamoto-san""s head. ""You amateur! Stay still! Hey, you!"" He pointed at Kurusu-san, who was now decked out in that weird gear again. ""You could fight, right? Let""s go!"" Morgana-san jumped and did a little flip. ""Come ...! Zorro!"" An explosive beam of bright blue light erupted around Morgana-san. I raised my hands to shield my squinting eyes from the light. The light mostly died down, but it was still surrounding ... the massive figure floating just behind Morgana-san. It was a massive armoured figure with legs that were way too thin to hold its massive body. Its helmet had two half-circle yellow eyes. There was a large Z on its stomach. There was a black cape flowing behind it. There was a rapier in its right hand that was normal sized by my standards but looked positively tiny in its massive hand. Zorro ...? I thought. As in The Mask of Zorro ...? Jesus Christ, what""s next? Antonio Banderas"" voice comes out of it? I was almost certain that I was completely insane at this point. Either that or somebody had spiked something I had eaten recently. One of the two. ""Y-You got one of those things, too!?"" asked Sakamoto-san.

Then I shall take every last on of your hearts for myself!"" she declared, and spread her arms. A massive cloud of black smoke billowed outwards, obscuring their vision. When it faded, the entire landscape had changed, turning into a large open room with the walls covered in thorns. Maleficent had also changed, having transformed into a large dragon with black scales and a purple underbelly. She roared at them, more smoke leaking from her nostrils. But Sora and the others were undeterred. ""Transform all you want! We""ll still win!"" Sora said. ""Right!"" Beast said, and charged at Maleficent. The witch-turned dragon swiped at him but he dodged it, and slashed at her arm. His claws were sharp enough to cut through her scales, and she growled in pain from the hit. Donald cast Thundara and aimed for her head, but the spell did little more than sting. In retaliation, she reared her head back and took a deep breath, before exhaling a massive wave of bright green fire. Donald squawked and ran to avoid the flames, while Goofy used his shield as cover. The sleeve of Sora""s jacket caught fire, but a quick Blizzard Spell put that at out before he rushed at Maleficent. She swung her tail at him and he jumped over it. He coated his Keyblade in ice before calling ""Freeze Raid!"" and throwing it at her head. It stuck and the ice on the blade shattered into countless tiny shards, leaving just as many small cuts along Maleficent""s face. She roared in pain and sent a concentrated jet of flames at him, forcing Sora to duck behind one of the thorn branches to

""I feel as if there has been a misunderstanding. Are you not here to assassinate Viceory Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation?"" she asked, keeping her words polite, though direct. Gayg snorted, muttering ""As if our Empress would waste her time worrying about that filth."" Kei sighed in annoyance, and looked at the Jedi Master. ""What my headstrong fellow Knight is trying to say is, no, we were not sent here to kill the viceroy. Rather, the Eternal Alliance learned of his capture on Rodia and suspected that the Confederacy would send an assassin to capture or kill him. So, we were ordered to board this ship and kill this person before they had the chance,"" she explained. Luminara frowned at that. To have not only learned of the Gunray""s capture so quickly not only spoke to how well their intelligence operations were, but having anticipated a rescue attempt before it even happened suggested that whoever was ordering these Knights around knew how to strategize. And that could spell problems in the future. As it was, she said aloud ""Then it appears we have a common enemy. So rather than try and kill each, and give Ventress a chance to succeed, why don""t we work together to find and capture her?"" The other members of the room blinked once, twice, and then a third time. ""WHAT?!"" several of them yelled, though the loudest was, predictably, Gayg. Glaring at Luminara with enough force to burn holes in paper, he said ""You actually us, Knights of Zakuul and warriors of justice, to lower ourselves by working with scum like you?!""

And please tell me it is something that will put last years to shame,"" Karin joked about the promise ring Ichigo had presented Orihime and after some confusion from Yuzu and Isshin that it was an engagement ring and they went around telling everyone they were getting married. ""Well,"" Ichigo blushed slightly, ""We will have to see about that."" Karin""s smile went away and before she could guess what it was, she heard Orihime coming down the stairs. ""Good morning Karin, Ichigo,"" Orihime giggled as she kissed him on the forehead and handed him a small white box. Ichigo was lost for words; Orihime was wearing a pink frilly skirt that ended just above her knees and a white blouse that had a red outline of Santa Claus on it. Her red hair was tied back into a ponytail and her hairpins held back her long bangs. She did not pause for a moment before she continued on towards the kitchen to help Yuzu and Isshin with breakfast. ""Yeah,"" Karin acknowledged, ""you""re gunna have to do better than a promise ring this year."" She patted Ichigo on his head before she walked up the stairs to her room. ""Where are you goin?""

Dumbledore smiled at her and said, ""The mirror shows whatever your heart desires."" When Emilia and Harry got back to the Common Room after talking to Dumbledore, they each went their separate ways. Emilia crawled into her bed but couldn""t sleep. She lay in her bed thinking about classes starting, and her parents. As she thought of them, who they must have been, tears began to run down her cheeks. ""Are you ok?"" Jess said, from her bed. ""I""m fine."" Emilia blurted out, as she wiped her face with her sleeve. ""Are you sure, you don""t sound fine."" Jess continued. ""I""m fine."" Emilia yelled, and she turned so her back was to Jess. Emilia closed her eyes and sighed. She eventually fell asleep under her covers in her robe. When she woke the next morning her eyes were still puffy and she had a bad migraine. Hermione helped her out of bed and brushed her hair.

As they ate breakfast in the Great Hall, Emilia said nothing. This continued for the rest of the day. As they sat in the Common Room that night, Emilia finally spoke.

""Hmm?"" He looked up to her, his index finger on his lower lip. ""Did you say something?"" She looked to him. ""Oh...well. I was just going to say...what if we added a belt?"" He stood up a bit straighter and looked at the dress again with different eyes. ""And...then we could change the way the sleeves looked...like this.""

""And then...if we added a little more fabric here..."" He walked forward, and began making the changes she had suggested and he had thought of. Soon the dress had been altered. They both looked at the dress in one of Ayame""s many mirrors. ""Mine-kun. It""s beautiful!"" He smiled. ""I have decided. I simply must have you!"" ""Huh?"" She stepped back.

I think it turned out okay."" She smiled. ""And this is for you."" She took a white rose from behind her and pinned it onto his jacket pocket. ""Now, don""t you look stately?""

""Yup. Guess so."" I sit down on the opposite end of the couch, trying to figure out just what to say. Instead of letting my nerves eat me up, I end up closing my eyes and listen to Edward play. His skillful fingers pick out a beautiful song, and soon I find myself humming along. ""If I could, I would, but I don""t know how..."" The words and tune are simple, but they speak volumes. Edward riffs at the end, concluding the song beautifully, and I can""t help staring at him. He stares right back and grins sheepishly.

Dinner flies by faster than I want it too and we sit there talking for about an hour before our waiter comes back, wondering if we would desire anything for dessert. We decide to split a chocolate molten cake and now, hunched over the dessert, we continue one of our many discussions. ""So have you looked at any colleges lately?"" He asks me casually while I take a bite of the cake, savoring the taste of perfected chocolate for a moment before swallowing. ""No,"" I admit rather sadly.

She formed a seal and an unearthly sound came from her mouth. At once Ino started to get drowsy. Ino knew she had to get out of the Genjutsu so she threw several kunai at Hitari. Hitari was caught by surprise and hit by the thrown kunai. One of the kunai that Ino had thrown was attached to an exploding scroll. Hitari felt the full force of the explosion and Ino immediately felt the Genjutsu lift, but was still experiencing server drowsiness.

He had a physicality she found fascinating. It was large and vital and more than a little distracting. While at work, she unconsciously kept tabs on his whereabouts. This was partly for his safety. And partly not. Over the years, it had just become habit. She always knew where Castle was and, more specifically, where he might be in relation to her. It never escaped her notice when he stood close to her or touched her, even if the touch was meaningless. Not that anything between them was these days. Every little thing carried infinite meaning now. And while her awareness of him had recently increased tenfold, she""d never felt quite so aware of him as when they were sitting in that narrow pew, side by side, the outside of her thigh pressed against the outside of his. She could feel him breathing, feel his body-heat. She could feel him shifting in his seat with every mention of the L-word and couldn""t help but wonder whether his restlessness was due to his unresolved marriage issues. Or whether, like her, the bride and groom""s vows seemed just a little too pertinent to the constantly growing feelings he held for the person beside him. It had been a minor relief to escape the chapel for the reception hall. But uncomfortable turned into something else altogether when Castle decided to guide her everywhere with one warm hand on the small of her back. He never did that when they were on a case and she was privately glad. She wasn""t sure she could handle the zing that ran up her spine on a daily basis. Just one night

So when he needed a secure place to hide the photo album, he stuck a book sleeve from the Mako Fractures series over it and placed it in the Urban Development section of the archives. So far, not even Reeve had bothered it. Swiping his access card in the slot, he hit the button for the archives and watched the lights count the floors. So, retrieve the book, and then use the pictures to find out who the other people are. The Turk had to be in the system, so if he used his appearance to scan the database, he might have another clue.

It had been a long time since he had been dating Ayaka and maybe he just needed to date a little to get over what had happened. The girls were cute in their shy flirting glances and soft giggles. Hiro stood behind the other two members of Bad Luck and chewed on his snack, only smiling occasional at a loud comment from Shuichi. Suguru""s friend was a tiny teen with large dark brown eyes and curly hair cut in a stylish bob, a simple sundress complimenting her creamy skin. He introduced her as Sayuri-chan, which got him some good humored teasing from Shuichi and Sayuri""s friends. They were having fun and laughing but Hiro felt a little apart from it all - maybe he was becoming the old man of Bad Luck.

Then there were all of his toiletries strewn across her bathroom counter: his razor and shaving cream, the pink and purple toothbrush she had bought for him teetering dangerously on the edge of the sink and his hairbrush which he had stubbornly insisted on bringing over after a scintillating argument about why sharing a hairbrush was not hygienic. But probably the worst of all and the one that kept her crying the longest was the photo strip she had been using as a bookmark. She and Martin had been watching a movie and when she pointed out that all great couples had jumped into photo booths and made ridiculous faces at the camera Martin had dragged her down to the nearest mall and pulled her into a booth.

""I""m Sasuke,"" he said when the loudmouth was done. No need to say his surname. ""I know."" She studied his face a moment more, and he found himself studying her in turn. She was a petite and pretty brunette, but he couldn""t see what it was about her that had drawn his brother back, again and again. She was an ordinary woman living in a small fishing village, not a shinobi. Not anyone important. Perhaps that was the point. ""Come in,"" she said, opening the gate.

429,"Text1: fan fiction ever, starting off with my most favoritest pair: Tonks & Remmy. Now. If you are here to bash my pairing, bash away. I don"" care, but tell me. I feel lousy when some one just tells me my story sucks for no reason. So, please, provide reason. Next, a lot of this may be some what inaccurate. I haven""t read the sixth book in who knows how long, seeing as I am more of a marauder person myself. Lastly, dedicated to Jawsies, because she put up with my complete Tonks/Remmy obsession last night when I was hyper on coca-cola. xD Remus Lupin was a strong believer in love. He""d done his readings, like Romeo and Juliet, and The Great Gatsby (though both endings hadn""t been happy). He thought he had understood love. Remus knew what caused some one to love another; he had read about it in books, and heard his friends (namely Sirius and James) talk about love. But Remus himself had never experienced love. So that day when he first met Nymphadora Tonks, Sirius"" second cousin, whose mother had also been disowned, he was unsure of the feeling that arose in his stomach. It wasn""t like a crashing wave that washed over him as he took in, with wide, shocked eyes, Tonks"" flamboyant bubble gum pink hair, her childish qualities and her rather upbeat, new age sense of style. No, it had been more of the feeling of: this is definitely some one different, some one I would like to get to know better. That was about it. Funny how things worked out. One moment you were meeting this intriguing girl, for that was really all she was, a girl compared to his age, and the next you could have sworn you were head over heels

Text2: ""I thought it looked good,"" I murmured, my voice husky. I cleared my throat and turned around when she told me it was all right, and I felt as if I were seeing her through new eyes. I had always figured things would happen like this, but I just assumed it would be a subtle kind of thing. Instead it was like being hit with a ton of bricks. I had always loved Nessie, but now I was in love with her, and I knew that we would be together forever and there was nothing else I wanted more out of my life. The feeling made my stomach clench slightly, and the urgency for human intimacy I hadn""t felt since I""d been in love with Bella had returned and was stronger than ever. ""What were you thinking about?"" Nessie cocked her head to the side and looked at me with those big, brown eyes. I just shrugged and grinned crookedly, and immediately she knew I had honestly been thinking about something, but it was something I wouldn""t tell her right now. She rolled her eyes and smoothed down her blouse before sliding her feet into a pair of shoes and grabbing her brand new backpack off of the bed. ""I""m ready... or as ready as I will ever be,"" she murmured under her breath. I couldn""t help but laugh at that, and she grabbed my hand as usual as we started down the stairs together. Even the contact between us was different now; itw as just a gesture of friendship, and we quite often held hands. But her skin against mine was like a shock of electricity that jolted through me, one that I did my best to ignore as we entered the living room where the rest of the","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""We""re already to go just as soon as Yuko gets here,"" answered the elder Lund, resting a hand on Minun""s head. ""Are you ready to challenge the Gym in Rustboro?"" ""Definitely, Dad, I""ve been working hard on getting Swift for the both of them perfected, and I think they""re ready, right guys?"" In response the two Cheering Pokémon gave a happy shout and a pat on their chest. ""Good to hear, I know you""ll be great,"" said the Professor, grinning at his son and his two Pokémon. Just several years ago Tori had been terrified of Pokémon, was too afraid to even touch a Pokémon. He never would have competed at the Battle Tower. Now he competes at the Battle Tower almost every day, and Plusle and Minun were always with him. The professor had always tried to encourage his son to get over his fear, get along with them, and see them as friends, and not something to fear. He always tried to get him to be more comfortable with him. After he got over his fear, he had actually been the one to buy Tori his first two Pokeballs to capture Plusle and Minun with, the first to bring up going on a journey with them and challenging Gyms, and the one bought Tori the gear he would need when he stated he wanted to travel Hoenn and compete in the league. He knew his son would be a great trainer someday. ""I hope so, Dad,"" said Tori as Plusle joined Minun standing on the desk. The two watched the two talked avidly to each other. It was several minutes later when the door opened again. This time in stepped a young women in a white

I recognized it as the one dad always took me and Ella too when we were kids. My fingers clenched involuntary at the thought of my dad. I sighed, and ran a hand through my hair. ""I have a brother and sister, and my mother""s sickly. She works all day and night with barely any breaks and since I""m the oldest, I should be helping taking care of my family."" I said, walking over to a swing. I suddenly saw visions of my dad pushing me and Ella on the exact swings. I saw myself laughing along with Ella and dad. (A/N: you know how they do it in the movies? Like, when the people are at an empty place and they show you a flash of the past at the same exact place, with people running around it?) ""Why such in a far neighbourhood?""

For a moment, as Claire tightened her grip on the gun, Peter braced himself for the bullet that would soon lodge itself in his body somewhere, the bullet that would finally end all the thoughts he wished he didn""t have but could no more stop than he could stop his own heart from beating... Then, with a brief SWOOSH! sound, Nathan landed in front of Claire, positioning himself directly between his brother and his daughter as he turned to look at the young blonde before him. ""Yes, there is, Claire,"" he said, his voice soft as he pushed the gun in Claire""s hand down towards the ground. Feeling the power surge through him, Peter tried to take a step back, even as he knew it would accomplish nothing; according to Issac""s painting, the explosion would take out all of New York, and he thought stepping back a few feet would give Nathan and Claire any kind of protection from what he was about to do? ""The future isn""t written in stone,"" Nathan said as he looked at Claire, his eyes reflecting his concern for his daughter for the first time since Peter had seen them together. For a moment, Peter almost wished that he could see them continue to develop that bond, even as he knew how hard it would be for him to see Claire be accepted all the more by his family, leaving him unable to do anything more than look and dream of what could never be...

It was true that he had daggered his siblings on more than one occasion over the centuries. However, the separation was to be temporary. He promised himself that once Michael was dead they would all be reunited. Now he feared the separation would become permeant. This was not allowed to happen. The cruse was broken, he was invincible and there was nothing in creation could hurt him and yet, Stefan had found a way to make him feel fear. Klaus was consumed with a rage that dispensed all rational thought. All he knew was someone would pay dearly. Eventually the prefect counter move came to him. Stefan had stolen from him. In turn he would steal from Stefan. So Klaus took the one thing that was irreplaceable to him. He took Elena. The deal was simple. Stefan would return his siblings and he would let Elena go. Obliviously Stefan""s life would obliviously be forfeit. No one that crosses Klaus could be allowed to live. However, he would be able to die knowing he protecting the love of his life.

This is their choice,"" I whispered so only she could hear. ""What""s the point of talking and stating your opinion when no one is going to hear you talking! Emmett they want to kill an innocent child, how can I just..Accept that my brother wants to kill his own child. Is this taking responsibility!"" Rosalie shouted. She was very upset - I am noticing that this happens a lot - so I wrapped me arms around her waist and held her. ""Rosalie this is something they want to do, if they are not ready for it then let them be,"" Edward said. ""If they weren""t ready for it then maybe they should have thought of that before,"" I Rosalie shouted. She had a point, ""I admit I haven""t made the best choices. But this by far is the worst. I hope your damn happy,"" Rosalie then pulled herself out of my arms and stormed down the street.

""I know you have a gentle heart Rosalie, but Jasper and Alice think that this is best for them. Though I know we both agree it""s wrong but its them not us. At least Jasper knows you are there for him right baby?"" I asked. I could hear Rosalie nodding in my arms. That""s when I heard someone clapping, who was that?

She sighed looking me over then held out her hand, ""Lily Evans,"" ""Oh, I did not ask to learn your name,"" I stated eyeing her. If she was going to act so ruddy disrespectable so could I, probably more so then she could. I had years of experience dealing with my parents after all. They could be the most impertinent and disregarding wizards in the society. ""Well in that case, I hope I have not bored you with such facts,"" she said her mouth open in a condescending smile. ""Names never did phase me, or flowers,"" I answered sitting back straighter in my seat. ""Well I certainly hope not people would think you sentimental,"" she answered coyly. ""That never was one of my virtues,"" I retorted back. She would be silenced by that. ""Clearly you are missing quite a few,"" she said looking back out the window smiling. Sirius eyed me his mouth open in mock alarm. Peter was shuffling his feet awkwardly, while Remus was messaging the bridge between his eyes. ""Inform me on which ones, I lack!"" I said in astonished horror. ""You lack Patience, Sentiment, Reticent, Intelligence, and Humility!"" she rattled off turning back to glare intensely at me. ""How so?"" I asked in marvel. ""You clearly do not take the time to speak others but would rather impatiently brand them unworthy. Your responses are mechanical and restrained. You have neither manners nor modesty. All in all you are an unbearable person to speak with."" She said breathlessly. Was I really like that? How could she ramble off such horrifying characteristics? I felt my mouth

""You could""ve made it easier by just asking me to climb a wall or something."" I rubbed my eye, then started the sparring match again. I got my butt kicked. When I finally picked myself off the ground for the 50th time, Trevor was watching me, tired and proud. ""Good. You dodged that punch that I thought you couldn""t."" ""Glad you have so much faith in me."" I rolled my eyes. I changed the subject abruptly. ""Why did you seem that sad when you learned Nafael died?"" I watched him seriously. Trevor looked sad. ""Fael and I were really close."" ""Like, how close exactly?"" I raised an eyebrow. ""Marriage close."" He sighed. My eyes widened. ""Wow. That close."" I said, stunned.

The stone door was shut with a lonely thud. Théoden did not move and he stood silently, staring at the grave while the rest of the people excluding Gandalf, slowly returned to their homes. The whole city was filled with the cries of heralds and war-horns. The king had returned with Gandalf and immediately issued his orders for all men to don shield and sword and to be ready to ride very soon. The guests and the house residents sat down to take what food they could in the king""s haste. Many were still very weary, and uncertain of the practicality of plans conjured by a wizard. Had they not been betrayed by such a person and now at war with him. Many questioned why the King of Rohan was listening to Gandalf. While they ate the king told them of his plan that had been advised by the wizard. The host would ride swiftly to the Fords to help Erkenbrand who was still defending the place where Théodred had fallen. Gandalf also told them much of Wormtongue that Éomer had already known. Grima had been the eyes and ears for Saruman in the kingdom watching for circumstances and preying upon weaknesses. The king had come from the mounds with a determined face. He spoke with Gandalf as the valorous man that many remembered from long ago. ""... Most of all I owe to you, my guest. Once again you have come in time. I will give you a gift ere I go, at your own choosing. You have only to name what it is. I reserve only my sword,"" the king said to Gandalf.

Text2: They all stood at the same time and after an awkward pause Rose pushed her way past the other two and stood in the aisle as the vehicle was unloaded. The lawn of Sky High looked freshly manicured and students walked about with smiles on their faces. Those expressions could only be attributed to the fact that school had not been in session long. ""So,"" Cynthia started, seeming very perky in the sunlight, ""What powers do you two have?"" ""Flying, absorption, telekinesis and teleportation,"" Rose growled out, squinting under the influence of the bright light. ""Really? I can fly too using my wind powers...I""m a full elemental with wind, water, fire and earth, both plants and seismic activities,"" she flipped her hair at the end of the long sentence. They both turned to look at the shorter girl who was following close behind. Alyssa smiled shyly, ""I""m a sidekick...""

Usually I only float a couple inches off the ground...one time I was able to do a foot,"" she looked to see if the other two Sues were impressed. They weren""t. ""I can also use it to make gravity increase for others...but not by that much, probably only adds a couple pounds."" Cynthia held up her hand to let the girl know it was time to shut her mouth.

""You wanted to see us commander?"" she asked. Vinyaya smiled at the trio. ""Please sit down. I""m afraid that we have some bad news."" ""I told you."" Artemis said to Holly. ""Excuse me?"" Vinyaya asked, surprised. ""I told Holly that it would be a crises of some sort."" Artemis said. ""Yes well anyway. As you know the two demon warlocks, Qwan and No1 were supposed to show up for debriefing but when they didn""t, Foaly checked the security cameras in the house they""re staying in. We""re lucky that the demons are so oblivious to technology because they didn""t even notice the camera."" ""What happened?"" Holly asked nervously. Trouble was surprised to see her and Artemis looking very nervous. He didn""t know how close the warlocks, Artemis and Holly were. Sharing consciousness kind of does that to a person. Vinyaya sighed, pointed a remote at a screen on the wall and turned it on. The clip showed several hulking demons stomping over to No1 and Qwan. The warped demons were bigger, stronger and had horns. Poor No1 and Qwan never had a chance when the demons jumped on them. Then they saw the demons lift up the warlocks and take them out of the room. Two demons that hadn""t been involved in the attack looked at each other. ""Why did they do that?"" one said to the other. ""Those two warlocks are part of the reason why we aren""t on the surface right now. They

Originally the doctors thought she broke her arm and there was a lot of bruising from her fall. Then they realized that she was bleeding internally. Andy""s father normally picked up Katie from school and Tommy was more than willing to stay with her that night so Sam could stay with Andy. That night had been touch and go - Sam did not sleep the whole night. The next day, Sarah drove in from St. Catharines to pick up her niece from school, freeing up Tommy to stay with Sam at the hospital. By nightfall Andy""s condition was stable, though she did not know where she was because she was on so much morphine. Giving into the urgings of Traci, Sarah, and Tommy, Sam returned home to his daughter while Tommy stayed with Andy. Sarah returned home, telling him to call if he needed anything. Sam was brought out of his thoughts with a loud crash followed by an ""uh oh"". He jumped up and ran to his daughter""s room. It looked like a bomb had gone off; contents of drawers were spilled all over the place. He noted that she must have been trying to get something out of the closet because the rod which held her hanging clothes was on the floor; probably the source of the crash. As soon as Katie saw him, she threw herself at him. Sam crouched and caught her, pulling her into his arms. ""Are you okay?"" he asked her as he stood up. She nodded and buried her head in his shoulder. ""Katie, what happened?"" ""I was packing."" Her voice was muffled because her head was still buried in his","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Running footsteps slammed against the marble floor and Emma felt Regina groan and stir as she came back to her senses. ""Your son is up.""

""Why is it that you have trouble with the same buttons every time?"" He stood back up, and straightened his outfit, not answering my question. ""You hit your head, didn""t you?"" His eyes widened. ""Don""t look at me like that, everybody heard the loud bang... and your word of choice"" He turned even redder than before and walked up to the room where Masako had fallen from.

""There""s an automatic drill lying on the floor down here. Come and clear up at once!"" Thor""s head snapped up, and he dashed down to fetch the drill. Never mind that he could have simply moved Loki""s suitcase, and opened his own again. The god of thunder returned several moments later, brandishing the tool in his hands, ""Don""t worry Nii-san, I""m going to give you air now. Move away from the edge of the suitcase."" He smiled, as he finally turned the drill on. He ignored the muffled complaints that grew in volume and pitch as he began drilling through the suitcase.

He called to Bruce, who was just loading his own case in with Tony""s, ""Can you pass me a spanner?"" Tony missed the look of confusion on his friend""s face, ""What for?

Text2: Laira walked into Draco""s room, carrying a dressing gown and some pajamas that she managed to borrow from her next-door neighbor. She put them on the bed, then almost jumped out of her skin when Draco walked out of the bathroom with nothing but a towel wrapped around his waist. She turned around quickly and walked out of the room, but not before she had seen his abs. Laira went into her own room and sat on her bed hugging a cushion. She had had a very long day, and just discovered that she was a witch. She wondered why Draco had not answered her question properly earlier. She smiled and lay back against her pillow. Draco wondered why Laira had left the room in such a hurry, but shrugged it off, and put on the nightclothes she had brought him. He went to her room to thank her, thinking she might hit him if he did not, but found her asleep in her day clothes on her bed. He walked quietly into the room, wanting a quick nose around before he went back to his room. He needed something to tease her about, some sort of imperfection. He looked at her dressing table, and saw some framed photos that had been positioned carefully on it. Draco moved in for closer inspection; most of the photos were of Laira with girls who Draco presumed were her friends from school or college. The photo in the middle however, was of Laira and a tall blonde guy. His hair was a similar shade to Draco""s. Laira looked a few years younger in the photo and was smiling happily up at the guy, and Draco noticed how the guy""s arm was around her waist.

Hinata""s nod was almost unperceivable. Naruto took a few calming breaths, he had to do it right the first time, or else they""d know what to look for, and they would fail. He wasn""t even sure it would work. Slowly, Naruto began to push a small amount of Chakra towards Sasuke, Gathering it around his right hand. He paused for a moment before he twitched his hand, and just out of sync Sasuke""s hand also twitched. For a moment the Uchiha was alarmed, but soon his right hand shifted into a different sign; A thumbs up. Sasuke would have been annoyed beyond belief, if he had not been at a loss to how to get the answers. A smile lit up upon his face as he stared at his hand, he could feel the lingering essence of Naruto""s Chakra pushing gently down upon his individual finger""s and muscles. Naruto sighed in relief, it had worked, No one had noticed except Sasuke. Slowly Naruto drew a small amount of Chakra from his right hand and pushed it gently towards Hinata""s right hand. This was the tricky part, if he didn""t work the Chakra bonds exactly right the idea would back fire. Naruto bit his lip lightly as he twitched his thumb slightly, but to his satisfaction, his hand did not move a bit, that is until Hinata shifted her hand across the desk slightly. Trying to hide the smirk upon his face Naruto brought his left hand

""What is it exactly?"" ""Well...we found it on this closed entrance. Not sure if it""s possibly a tomb... I thought maybe you could have a look at the writings."" ""Sure."" The lack of attention to her leg, however, resulted in her accidentally cutting her skin. ""Ow! Damn it!"" ""What happened?"" ""Nothing, I just -... Never mind."" She quickly attended to her tiny cut. ""I""ll send the pictures by e-mail. Hopefully you can make out what they mean...Really unexpected."" ""Just by hearing this, I agree."" Finally she dried her skin and exited the bathroom. Rushing into the small room where a blue-and-white desk with a laptop had been. Elizabeth sat down, in her underwear, still with a towel in her left hand whilst holding the cell phone with her right. ""Did you get them?"" he asked. ""Wait..."" Elizabeth logged into her account where a new message was waiting in her inbox. She clicked on it and surely enough, it was an email from Freddie. The ten high-resolution images were downloaded immediately. ""Yeah, I did."" The first picture that popped onto the screen was of an underground, sealed, stone entrance surrounded by - strangely enough - red rock. There were no painted images except pale white letters around the square entrance. ""Wow. I""ll give you a call if I have anything."" ""Okay, thanks, Elizabeth."" When the connection ended, Elizabeth began to view the digital photographs curiously. As she zoomed in on some, her chin resting on her hand, Elizabeth quickly grabbed a notepad and pen next to the laptop without even having to look with her eyes for them.

Text2: Viper doesn""t tell anyone, but she thinks that Mantis may know - she volunteered to help him with Po""s acupuncture session with surprising alacrity and he had caught her gazing at him half a second too long, acupuncture needles long forgotten. Mantis doesn""t mention anything and she doesn""t expect him to, because she learnt a year back that her rattle has a thing for keeping insects quiet; she glares at him and the threat rides a hideous, traitorous undercurrent, causing Mantis to stick a needle a hair too far to the right. He smiles at her with the effervescence she""s come to know and love, gives that laugh she never knew she could care about so deeply - she reacts the only way she knows how; look away shyly, feeling the zither music soaring in her veins. For all her cold-bloodedness, Viper finds that she""s not too proud to admit she""s never felt so warm before. If necessary, she would carve her own heart out and offer it to him, her pound of flesh to purchase his love. If that wasn""t good enough, she""d wear it on her sleeve (if she had sleeves) as a badge of rejection, an epaulet bearing the rank which no one wants; a poor second best. Po""s visibly frustrated - he ploughs his way through five whole helpings of cookie dough, stopping only after four and a half to inhale deeply from the bucket of water on the table. She giggles and raises an eyebrow when he tries to hiccup and burp at the same time; Po starts to choke and she reaches over to bang him on the back.

She already knew what she wanted to do, or rather what she was dying to do; but working up the courage to actually do it, was proving more difficult than she had imagined. Cursing under her breath, she picked up her oil lamp and headed down the darkened corridor. She had no idea what time it was- but she assumed that it must be getting close to midnight- judging by the fact that all of Winterfell had retired to their chambers for the night. She reached his door and exhaled a sharp breath into the cool night and shivered when she saw cold mist come out of her mouth. She knocked loudly and firmly onto the hard wooden door, before she had a chance to chicken out and retreat back to her own bedroom. ""Who is it?"" He called out from inside his chambers. ""It""s me...it""s Sansa."" She said, her voice quivering a little as she spoke. ""My dear, what""s wrong?"" Petyr asked once he had opened the door, placing both of his hands onto her shoulders firmly. The feel of his strong hands on her body almost made her want to kiss him then and there. It took all her strength and willpower to resist the urge. ""May I come in? I would rather have this conversation in private."" Petyr searched her face with a worried expression, before nodding and allowing her to pass inside into his chambers. Her eyes were instantly drawn to the four post bed and she blushed deeply as dirty, unladylike thoughts started to fill her head. Usually she would never think like that. But Winter was coming.

If you listen you will hear her too- Kurama listened intently and sure enough he could hear her, but she wasn""t in her room, nor was she on the roof like normal.

Kurama couldn""t stand to see her in such emotional pain any longer. She called out to every protective instinct in his body, he wanted to protect her from the world, from himself.

Takara said to Charlie, petting him in his little web in her room. She left the House, with Alex, Charlie following them and watching them leave. Charlie then turned his attention to the living room. He jumpped on the couch and to the coffee table to find the remote. He fiddled with the battery hatch to take out the batteries for the Remote. A pair of small batteries popped out and on the floor. Charlie took one battery and started to suck on the Plus Side. When he was finished with it, he tossed it to the side and began running around the house. He explored behind the TV to the vacant Socket that he usually snacked on but noticed the plug about it was different. It was bigger and the cord was thicker. He followed the cord, down till his eyes lit up like a human child on Christmas. It was a Power Strip with three empty sockets. Charlie Squealed loud and excited! He jumped towards the Power Strip, Fangs ready to suck when he was halted by Lillian with Levitate. ""Now Charlie. You are free to suck on that plug behind the TV but the Power Strip is a No no.""

She knew Starfire""s past thanks to the Puppet King, she knew about Cyborg from when they worked on the T-Car, and Robin told everyone where he came from on the first day. But Beast Boy had never offered a hint or a clue about where he was born, or how he came to be a hero. And it bothered her that she had never even thought about this before. She didn""t even know about this place, and how many times he had come here. Of course, it didn""t help that she spent almost all of her time in her room meditating or reading a book, but she usually knew what was going on. How could she not have noticed that he went missing?

She was saved answering that question by the dinging of a bell that signaled that their order was ready. She got up, grateful that her blush had gone down.

Star was just grateful that he didn""t catch her lie, she dropped her mask and turned towards Gambit and told that a car was on its way for him they just needed to make it to the road which should be about a five minute walk from where they were now.

The older tamer agreed and began leading the troop towards the west. They walked for days and days, camping at little spots. It was already a week since they arrived yet they hadn""t reached their destination. What was more disturbing was the fact that no digimon came to attack them. If any came, it was only to be friendly or to hero-worship Ryo (much to the digimon queen""s dismay). This only made the Tamers feel even more unsettled, like the calm before the storm. It was night time again and this time they set up camp near a cave. It was quite a large one though none had seen it in their previous venture, except Ryo.

Of course, everything her parents bought her were anything but the best and finest for a small child.

Obsidian Nightlight Sasuke sat perched in the same branch he had been sitting in every night for the past few months. Being an Uchiha, he suffered from the same affliction that consumed his late family. Insomnia. He used the cloak of night to watch the object of his desires, the one that quickened his pulse and sent his heart into a spin every time said obsession glanced his way. Sasuke smiled at his sleeping teammate, separated by a pane of glass. ""Naruto."" He whispered. The slumbering blonde shifted in his sleep and mumbled something incoherent. Sasuke took the risk of moving closer on the branch, brushing the windowpane with his fingertips. Naruto shifted again and faced the glass,

Slowly, he rose up to a sitting position. He winced in pain, cradling his head in his hands. Around him, everything seemed to be spinning around, his vision blurry. A rustling sound startled Ryouga. The door to his room began to open, little by little. As his vision started to return to normal, Ryouga spotted a pair of eyes peering up at him through the door""s narrow opening. ""Well, look who""s finally up and about."" (Ak- no, it""s Ukyou.) ""Ukyou-san?"" he managed to say while looking around. ""Where am I?"" Ukyou closed the door behind her.

Not to mention the other two, all from noble families. Our division is going to have to compensate this with money."" Hitsugaya massaged his temples.

To be completely fair, anyone, highly likely including her, would""ve prostrated before the feet of the man that could kill them with a jab of a stick-anyone claiming resolutely otherwise was a hypocrite. Or, perhaps, Chara would think such because she had never been to the other side: she had never known the friendship the Golden Trio and the three loyal Marauders had claimed for themselves: undying devotion for one another. All Chara had from her previous life were people she sat with at lunch, in class and to nod to one another in hallways. As it turned out, Chara didn""t need to go to Sirius. He came for her, keen on physical affection as he was. He bumped noses with her, either not noticing or ignoring the instinctive cringe from the baby. ""Sorry for the wait, were you good?"" Chara didn""t find the need to reply though, mentally, she thought there was something fundamentally wrong about three grown men trusting a one-year-old to not get herself killed without supervision-the fundamental difference in mentality of the wizards and Muggles baffled her sometimes.

Her stomach tightened like somebody was squeezing it like a bicycle horn. Pain radiated through her tiny body. Tessie groaned, the sound muffled by the tape that covered her mouth. Her eyes were red from all the crying she did last night. In any case, she wasn""t sure if she could cry anymore. The memories of Mom, Dad and Bruce haunted her fitful exhaustion. Nightmares that were so intense that she dreaded going to sleep. She could smell the blood and gunpowder. Uncle Jay""s laugh always rang in her ears. Instead, she spent that time trying to get away.

I stayed closed in my tiny, cramped apartment, never going out or talking to anyone, in danger of being evicted for not paying the bills and getting fired from my job. Those months were, perhaps, the darkest days of my life. What Ron had done to me made me question myself. It made me rethink who I was, who I had become for him; it made me doubt my morals and standards. Harry came to visit as soon as he heard what had happened. When I saw him, he looked pale and shaken. His emerald eyes were wide and full of concern- all for me. I don""t think I had ever totally appreciated how much of a good friend Harry was until then. He held me in his arms and rocked my until my sobs subsided. He comforted and consoled me as Ron never had. He boosted my spirits and my confidence until I felt almost human again. He convinced me to get up and re-build my life on top of the pieces of the old one. "" You can""t change the past, Mione,"" he gently told me, gazing at me with utmost sincerity. "" You can only change the future. Change yours for the better."" He made me promise to try. He made me swear on everything between us that I would not break down and give up on life anymore. And so I did. In return, he vowed he would never leave me, as Ron had. He swore that he would always be there for me, as a friend. Soon, I lived for Harry. I lived for the promises we made. When days went by without seeing Harry, I mourned. I never felt complete unless if I was with him.

When Sakura thought of it at all, she told herself that it had really started at Jiraiya""s funeral, but if she were going to be honest, things had begun to change between them long before that. A subtle shift had occurred after Naruto had promised to bring Sasuke back; then again, after she watched Naruto lying in the hospital bed, when she had vowed to become stronger. A montage of memories invaded her mind when she thought of Naruto; his face, always earnest and eager when he looked at her; his willingness to do whatever she asked of him, except clean up after himself; his buoyant smile; his ruffled, uncontrollable hair. So no, it hadn""t begun at Jiraiya""s funeral. The funeral had been a mere catalyst for what was already in the making. Tsunade""s eyes had been red-rimmed from crying and sake. ""I""m fine,"" she""d said harshly when Sakura had asked her earlier that morning if she could help. And then, as if to make light of their pain, the day had been beautiful. The sun had been shining down, as warm as Jiraiya""s smile had once been. Naruto""s entire body had been contorted by grief, his face racked by pain. He had reached out for her hand and held it like it was the only thing keeping him from drowning, as if she let go he might be lost forever.

If you don""t want to explore the passion between us then you need only say so."" It wasn""t anger in his eyes but hurt. ""Do not needlessly put yourself in danger because you think I""m unable to control myself."" It burned in his gut that she thought for one moment that he wouldn""t respect her wishes. There was nothing more sacred than a woman, particularly Lydia Martin. He would never hurt one hair on that beautiful strawberry blonde head of hers. In an effort to comfort her, Peter put more distance between them. ""Sit down, relax, comb through my library...do as you wish, Lydia. I will not bother you."" Another rumble of thunder shook the ground beneath her feet and Lydia knew that Peter was right. Her Prius wouldn""t protect her from the violent storm raging outside. ""Fine...thank you."" Nodding curtly, Lydia brushed past Peter as she headed toward the bookcase. Maybe he had some sort of book on the supernatural or a bestiary all his own; a girl could dream. Unfortunately all she found on those shelves were classics, most of them were well worn and loved. Her fingertips slid over copies of Les Miserables, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Alice in Wonderland. Beneath that was a row of what looked like cookbooks, passed down through generations. Gazing upward, Lydia noticed that on the top shelf there were older leather-bound books. Standing on tiptoe she tried to reach but came up short. Jumping to

GIR pointed at the television which was showing a rerun of Mysterious Mysteries. The Mysterious Mysteries episode showed a picture of a Mask. Zim was shocked to see it looked exactly like the one in his hands. ""The Mask."" The announcer explained. ""Is one of the world""s most famous legends. Thought to be created in Africa (others speculate it is of Viking nature) The Mask has the amazing ability to give it""s wearer anything he or she wishes. Though the user has his/her conscience and inhibitions removed thus turning him into a insane living cartoon, many still search for The Mask to gain this absolute power. Last sited in New York, it""s current whereabouts are unknown. But who knows..."" the announcer pointed at the camera, as if pointing to Zim. ""You might be next."" Afterwards the show""s credits rolled, and The Mask was still in Zim""s hands. Zim looked down at the wooden Mask in his hands. It didn""t look like much. It looked like it would be a better paperweight than a tool for fulfilling dreams. Yet as he continued to stare at The Mask, he couldn""t help but notice it was generating an eerie magical glow. Zim wondered what the harm of trying it on was. It was probably a fake anyway. He slowly lifted it to his face, but a split second later The Mask slipped out of his hands, went over his head and landed on his Pak. Then something like an electric storm engulfed Zim""s Pak and the irken began to spin wildly out of control. And that""s where things got real interesting... Author Note: When Zim spins

Every time he had screamed at her, pushed her, called her ORCA (she wasn""t even that fat!), there was always a little weed of anger rooted in her sadness. When she had left Inaba, that sorrow passed, but the anger had remained, subtle, causing barely a ripple in her usual good-natured temperament. But whenever she thought of Kanji, it not only came back, it surged. She wanted to do all kinds of things to him then, say and do things she never had the courage to do when she was younger. She wanted to hurt him, hate him. So many violent urges she had funneled into her intense home runs and frantic sprints. And now, here it was. THE golden opportunity to do it, to make him cry for a change, she could beat him and she knew he wouldn""t lift a finger. She could yell at him, tell him he was a coward, a pervert, a sissy, tell him how utterly worthless he and his offer was to her, how much of a loser he was. Most of all, she could tell him, at long last, finally tell him... ""I""M SORRY!!!!!"" That was it, no barbs at his sexuality, no trauma to his body (especially his privates), no revving of engines to announce a car roaring in his general direction, nothing. And it confused the hell out of Kanji. ""Sorry, what the hell are you apologizing for?"" seeing her tremble slightly and hug the koala close to her chest, only added to his bewilderment.

He""ll be having more than enough screen time in the future. DAY ONE Remy LeBeau was... Bored. It was very depressing for him. Usually, he would spend this time (the time Rogue spent at school or sleeping or having dinner,) thieving, planning his thievery, or planning how he would make Rogue his. Basically, his life was thievery and Rogue. He ignored how sad that sounded. Now, however, he had that antsy feeling that he got right before a difficult heist. Only, instead of minutes before, it was hours before he would be able to sneak into the mansion. He needed to do something. He walked around the base, only expecting to see Pyro laughing his ass off over something trivial and repetitive, and was not surprised in the least when Pyro staggered a little ways down the hall, screaming and bumping into the wall, dripping a red liquid and a sword in his chest. But the sword was tucked underneath his arm, seen clearly from only a good fifty yards away, and the sword was a plastic pirate sword that the team had bought him from Toys R Us to keep him entertained. Remy didn""t know if the blood was real or not. But he didn""t care much. Remy was anxious, and that left him no room to care about others. His antsy feeling was quickly explained when a dark, bulky figure jumped down from the vents and attempted to stomp down on him as if this were

As they walked past the door to the conference room, several zombies busted their hands through the windows, two managing to grab onto Leon""s arm. Dante jammed his knife into the hand of one while Leon fired a round from his handgun into the second, splitting it in half.

Seconds later, the statue moved forward before a key fell from the vase the statue held over one shoulder. The bow of the key resembled a spade, which Dante picked up on.

477,"Text1: last chapter. Yeah, I actually believed that. Needless to say I was not expecting to check my email and find more than 120 reviews waiting for me, with over ninety percent being negative. With those ranging from just plain disappointed to overflowing with outrage and grief. The review from Selonianth summed up the response nicely I think. *smacks the author and walks away* Sorry. To those of you who asked why I decided to put something like this in here now my answer is simple. The idea came to me and I (honestly!) thought it would make a nice little chapter. And to make this crystal clear, what happened in the last chapter is an AU and not the regular storyline. So please, no reviews asking why Naruto is thirteen again when he was the Hokage just last chapter. Given the huge negative response I decided to hurry up and post another chapter before I found myself surrounded by an angry mob with torches and pitchforks. Oh, and about this chapter I already know the physics are wrong. But what I have written is necessary for the story. So I beg you no reviews telling me that what I say is wrong. He was once again in the Uchiha compound. This time he had come without the Hokage. After his usual morning work outs with Fukasaku had sneaked into the tea house and made his way through the secret passage.

Instead he was doing this. ""You know I""m going to complain to the Hokage about this."" Naruto said. Itachi looked unconcerned. ""You are free to

Only a few seconds later did it start up again, yet JJ was still blind to the urgency of the person on the other end of the wretched technology. JJ kept walking, only the cold air and darkness of the night being able to keep her company. As if on cue, her phone began ringing right as JJ began to realize her surroundings.

His contact picture bringing back a memory JJ had almost forgotten. ""God JJ, stop walking so fast!"" Will chided gently from a few steps behind her petite frame.

Will persisted, as he ran behind JJ and wrapped his arms around her hips and picked her off the ground swinging her around in a circle, as she giggled, her eyes bright with a unique light. ""Will!"" JJ squealed as she grasped the strong arms holding her in the air. Finally Will put JJ down in front of him looking deep into her vibrant blue eyes.

The only ones that were not doing that were both Chloé who was still on the phone, trying get a couple of more props to be delivered that day, and Sabrina, who was basically cataloguing everything Chloé was ordering. Soon, there were dozens of black cats, witches flying on a broomstick, pumpkins and ghosts cut out. Mylene, who had just finished cutting out a witch, and was getting ready to cut a pumpkin, noticed that Marinette looked a little absent-minded, as she kept looking into one of the gym walls. ""Marinette? Marinette?! Can you hear me?"" -Mylene asked her, bringing her back down to Earth. ""Uh?! What?"" ""I was saying, what are you thinking about, Marinette?"" -Mylene asked her. ""Me?

Sebastian said. ""But why would that ghost want your cousin and uncle out of the mansion?"" Daphne asked, confused. ""Beats me, Daphne... Mark never told me and I don""t even have a clue as to why he would want to do it."" Sebastian sighed, frustrated. ""Maybe someone from our past is back to get revenge on us."" Fred suggested. ""Don""t forget, we put a lot of them behind bars and they were obviously unhappy about that. Could be a case of revenge.""

All those years he had waited, watching Merlin from across the water that separated them. Yet now when Merlin was a mere hand""s breadth away, he was somehow even further from Arthur than he had ever been before. ""I waited so long,"" he said, and was surprised to find the words come out in a sort of croak. He felt his vision blur and blinked hastily. Merlin""s face was one of absolute pity. ""I""m sorry,"" he was saying. ""It""s just - it""s not me. All right?"" Arthur said nothing. ""I""m Martin Earlton,"" said Merlin. ""And I want to go home now."" Arthur blinked down. He was still clutching hold of Merlin""s sleeve. He let it go. From behind him, Sarah whispered something, and the door to the HQ opened. ""I""d advise not going to the cops about this,"" she said airily. ""They won""t find us and you""ll get done for wasting their time.

Erik sighs and finishes his bottle. On the dancefloor, Storm laughs at something Sabretooth has said to her and Psylocke and Jean are in deep conversation about some technical telepathic subject. Erik decides, abruptly, that he has had enough - of the beer, of the party, of this strange mixture of the Brotherhood and X-Men, of everyone being friends, and turns to go as quietly as he can. Naturally, Charles catches him up before he even gets halfway to the mansion. ""Sick of socialising?"" Erik pauses and glances behind him. Charles smiles at him from his wheelchair and the bench beside him, situated under a group of silver birch trees which Erik had marched past without a second glance. It occurs to Erik that Charles could have been hiding there after Erik""s conversation with Raven, and had just manipulated Erik not to see him. Charles cocks his head, as if reading Erik""s suspicions, but says nothing. He merely waves a hand at the empty bench beside him. Erik is unable to do anything but obey. He sits on the bench beside Charles""s chair, and Charles leans on the wheelchair armrest as is fast becoming his habit, and looks closely at Erik. His eyes are very blue in the dark twilight. ""Do you hate it here?"" he asks. His pupils are quite large, Erik notices blearily, which means he must be quite a bit drunk. ""Sometimes,"" Erik finds himself answering truthfully. Something in Charles""s expression flickers, something so worrying that Erik adds hastily, ""I""m not leaving for the Second Brotherhood, Charles."" ""I know,"" Charles says instantly.

Ishida Uryuu knew quite a bit about this concept of unfairness, and indeed more than anyone would want to. But then, perhaps that was the point.

But beyond the lectures Ryuuken had given him when he was young, there were always the more concrete examples of life""s unfairness. The fact that his grandfather had died so that some twisted excuse of a shinigami could torture him in the name of scientific research had certainly been unfair, and the way he had lost his

Text2: I swear to God that the bitch Rukia needs to go die in a fucking hole. She""s always nagging me to kill Hollows and get off my '""lazy""' ass to save the town while she can""t do shit! When she transfered her powers to me, most of them were taken from her in the process. Though she still had her kido which is absolutely useless as well. Although it feels SO good to rant on and on about how much she is a useless whore, I still kinda feel grateful to her for some reason. Was it because if it wasn""t for her then I wouldn""t be doing this kind of stuff dail- wait.

Thinking about that just made me scowl in disgust because I dont like her or Orihime at all. But at least Orihime isn""t as obnoxious and annoying as Rukia as I thought of her the first time around. So to clear my jumbled head of these head-ache causing thoughts, I picked up my Ipod Touch and started to listen to my all time favourite band, Three Days Grace. All of their songs in my opinion were mind-blowing, especially live. I""ve only been to their concert once and I was already blown away by their music.

After pushing my shoulders down so that I plopped down on one of the many expensive couches, before making her way over to her boyfriend, Jasper Whitlock. The tall, lean, and muscular, honey blond was sitting next to his twin sister, Rose. Rosalie Hale was a tall, beautiful blond that looked as if she was a swimsuit model from the Sports Illustrated magazines. Her beauty was so radiant that I often felt self conscious while standing within a ten feet range of her. She could make almost any models self esteem lower to the bottom of the deepest ocean. Rose was sitting next to her boyfriend, Emmett. Emmett MCarty was huge- muscled like a severe weight lifter- with dark brown, curly hair. Although he looked all big and tough, he was like the big brother I""d never had. He was like one gigantic teddy bear. The couples (Jasper and Alice; Rose and Emmett) fit together so perfectly. They seemed destined to be together their whole lives. I, on the other hand, was the odd man out, the spare wheel. I had no one. No special hubby. No one seemed like the kind of person that I""d want to spend time with. Like my dad says, start looking in college. We were all just sitting there, staring at random things around us. This was big.

He seemed far too happy for her to stay gloomy. Even if his motions still were a little stiff every now and then, indicating that he wasn""t fully comfortable. But that was hardly to be expected after what he had gone through lately. Still, in his eyes was nothing but relief and delight; he was perfectly happy just to be there in the dusky room, eating donuts. In the middle of a chomp he suddenly turned his head slightly and smiled at her again, willing his overfilled mouth to stay at least as politely shut as he could manage right then. Almost as if he wanted her to know that he hadn""t forgotten that she still was watching him silently, and was grateful for the help. And the donuts. She opened her mouth without really thinking, knowing that she wanted to say something but unsure of what. Something named Milly came in between before Meryl could think of anything to tell the blond man, however. ""Mr. Vash!""

Dammit, LJ!"" growled Michael, slamming the door shut and locking it behind him. Getting to the bottom of the stairs and still no sign of LJ, Michael looked over the street before him. ""Oh man, oh man, oh man,"" he mumbled. The street in front of the apartment building wasn""t as heavily trafficked as other streets would be. But to a small child like LJ, even one car was trouble. Luckily, there didn""t appear to be a splash of blood on the street. That was good. But it also wasn""t much of a lead. Michael looked at both ends of the street. To the left was the more busier street. There was a corner store, owned by Mister Caraballo, and a few blocks away was the subway. Michael didn""t want to take that direction. He turned towards his left, and ran that way. Hopefully, LJ would have been turned away from the more active road and more towards the safer right side. & Michael sniffed back some tears as he slowly made his way back to where he lived. Without LJ. He had walked as far as he had dared to go, even threading into areas Lincoln had told him not to go. He""d seen a few people he knew, asked them and looked around as much as he could without bringing attention to himself. The last thing that he needed was for CPS to be knocking on their door. Because he was not going back. Ever. In Michael""s overly active mind, he went over dozens of scenarios that could potentially be happening to his nephew at that

He still had this huge love for soccer and joined the soccer team along with his twin Lil. he grabbed a bag out of his locker. Chuckie watched him carefully, ""what""s that?"". ""Week old sandwich,"" he shrugged his shoulder and took out the sandwich taking a bit of it. ""I have a gross boyfriend,"" a female voice came from behind them, they all turned around to see Phil""s girlfriend Nicole standing with Lil both of them with their arms crossed.

The woman placed her head on her hand, turning her head towards him. Okay, she""ll play his little game for a bit. After all, he was very handsome and had a brilliant smile. Most guys were ugly and smelled of alcohol, smoke, and sweat. He had a very inviting smell of cologne that tickled her senses. ""Oh? What""s the occasion?"" she asked, giving him a flirty grin. ""Can""t a guy be nice?"" he asked, folding his hands in front of him on the counter. He then flagged down the bartender and ordered a drink for her as the bartender nodded and started right on it. ""I can""t even begin to count how many guys have wanted to buy me a drink,"" she mused, glancing towards the uniformed man mixing the drink for her. He placed the glass in front of her and she brought it closer to her, taking the small red straw and stirring it gently. ""Really?"" ""No,"" she admitted, getting him to chuckle at her fib. ""A big girl like me doesn""t get much attention."" ""You got my attention,"" he replied to the comment. She laughed, not believing this guy. ""You must be drunk,"" she joked. She took a small sip of her drink, careful not to get too much lipstick on the edge of it since she had one more set to do before going home for the night. He laughed, glancing down at the table. ""No, not yet anyway,"" he said, bringing up his drink to show his glass was still halfway full. ""It""s Vegas baby, you will be,"" she remarked. She flipped her hair

""And I""m not just saying that to divert attention from the small amount of actual sleeping we did last night."" As if she needed a reminder. She was pleasantly sore from all that not sleeping. She started to shift. ""I should get up and shower. Whatever you want to make sounds fine."" He frowned. ""Breakfast in the shower could be problematic. Will you get back in bed afterwards?"" ""We""ll see, Castle. No promises."" In truth, she was feeling unusually lazy. The defining case of her life was closed, at least her part in it was, her employment status was ambiguous at best, and she had nowhere to be until her dad got back to town tonight. Maybe she would get back in bed for breakfast. Castle sensed the odds were in his favor and pressed his advantage. ""Allow me to highlight the merits of this arrangement. First, the location is convenient for post-carbo-load napping. Second, it""s also convenient for post-nap entertainment."" The hand on her stomach strayed lower to illustrate. ""Third- contranym!"" His hand stilled. Still schooling her reaction to number two- had she always been this insatiable?- it took her a moment to register number three. She turned to look at him and saw that his mind was suddenly elsewhere. ""We should have breakfast in bed because of contranym? Is that related to our methods of protection talk the other day?"" Castle""s attention blinked back to her, but not fully. ""No, that""s not- sorry, different train of thought jumped back on the tracks. But it gave me an idea... Take your time in","{""output"": ""NO""}"

""Oh, and how might I ask, are you going to manage that?"" James inquired, seemingly interested in the idea. ""Quidditch of course! What would be more irritating to the prat gang than, Me, the brilliant, handsome, fantastic wizard, Sirius Black, snogging their leader""s sister in front of the whole school, on a broom, mid air, after we clean their clocks and win the quidditch cup! Seeing as how she is our finest chaser. and I am our finest beater."" ""You forgot modest."" James teased. ""Well this will all only work out if you in fact catch the snitch instead of malfoy. You can handle that cant you?"" Sirius teased back, raising his eyebrow .

""Oh I can get away with it. believe me. I will have her heart in the palm of my hand before long."" Sirius stated, now thoroughly pleased with himself. ""We""re going to be legends."" he added, more to himself than to James. ""Only if you don""t get yourself torn to shreds first, I ""spect Malfoy will want to bludgeon you after all this..""

The trunk of the car was also magically bigger than what a normal car like this one would have been. Soon all was packed into the car and this time Harry didn""t forget Hedwig, much to her delight. Once into the car they all sped off. Harry wasn""t surprised to see that what looked like only two back seats was merely an optical illusion and he saw that there were in fact six back seats with more than enough room for them all. ""I hope they treated you alright dear."" Mrs. Weasley said turning back in her seat to see him better. ""As best as could be hoped in that hellhole."" Harry said nonchalantly. ""Hey Ron, how was the US?"" Harry asked turning to Ron now. ""I thought you""d never ask!"" Ron said excitedly. ""It was great!"" Fred put in. ""Fantastic fireworks for muggles."" Mr. Weasley added. ""It still amazes me how they manage to get things done without the use of magic. Inventive people the muggle are, always finding ways to work around magic. They never cease to amaze me, why just the other day.."" ""AS I was saying Harry. We saw so many cool things. We went to a huge statue called the Satue, Staute, damn. Give me a minute.""

""You have a question for me, don""t you and I have one for you. You go first."" ""Very well."" She sat at her small kitchen table across from Elsie. She had mushed an apple down to nothing and was planning on feeding it to Charlie while his mother had her soup. It would be the boy""s first real food. He eyed it carefully from his place in his grandmother""s arms, wondering what it was. ""I want to know what happened between you and my son."" She said simply ""And I want to know where your son is."" Ch 4- The Very Thought of Him, Part I ""Your poor mum seems tired."" Mrs. Carson whispered in her tiny grandson""s ear.

He was comfortable in his grandmother""s arms now, and understood she was a nice woman who could care for them both...he had no concept of course, that she was his grandmother. A little earlier in the evening, she""d fed him his first food aside from breast milk, a small bowl of strained apples that he""d taken to very quickly. It""d been Mrs. Carson""s final test that the boy really was her grandson: his father had had an insatiable appetite for apples at that age and Charlie had taken to it in just the same way. Mrs. Carson was now thoroughly convinced. ""Let""s let her sleep wee lad. I think she really needs it."" Elsie fell right to sleep after her bath.

Text2: As if something had changed, Michael opened his desk drawer and reached in, lifting his lone, simple book, and let his fingers grope the letter. It was still there, indeed. He lifted it and set it before him. I""ve read about you in the papers, it said, and I want to see you. I want to see you. ""Our business was finished years ago,"" Michael whispered. ""I don""t want to see you."" But his fingers had gone and wrapped themselves in the silver chain around his neck. Maybe, when Michael said such things, he was lying even to himself. He was still sitting on the edge of his bed, face in his hands, thinking. In the earliest hours of the morning, Michael was thinking. Strange emotions had resurfaced in his chest; he could not ignore them again, that much he knew. Once he had ignored, then given in completely. Then he had withdrawn, and now he was once again teetering on the edge. Michael knew that he had to find a happy medium. But Michael did not know how to find a happy medium. He considered exactly how to answer the letter, for not answering it had never truly crossed his mind at all. Instead, he was not sure if he would say yes, or no. Though Michael could feel his heart begin to answer for him. Dear Snitch, he would say, I couldn""t believe it was you after four years... Four years. What an amazing thing, this singular, miraculous letter. A gift, a second chance ... would he now be brave enough to take it? He knew the number already.

Of course, you""re my sidekick now, so you""ll be there with me a lot. It""s really the Audubon Bay Bridge tower."" ""Boy, I""ll bet you have a beautiful view of the city from up there."" ""I do,"" Darkwing said, smiling, ""But I""m going to have to find a house to live in if I""m going to have a daughter. Where do you live, LP?"" ""Well, I don""t have a house yet either in Saint Canard. I""m still in Duckburg."" ""Well, why don""t you move in with Gos and me? It makes sense; I mean, we""ll be working together and we can share expenses."" ""Good idea!"" Things were working out better than Launchpad could have ever hoped. He wasn""t only going to have a job where he could do something truly meaningful again, but he was not going to have to live alone anymore. In a sense, he was going to have a family in Saint Canard. ""Wait a minute!"" DW said, startled. ""What am I thinking? Launchpad, we need to go to the tower before we go to the orphanage. I need to get out of costume."" At the tower, Darkwing took off his mask. ""My real name is Drake mallard. It""s probably best if you call me Drake if I""m out of costume and we""re out in public."" ""You got it, Drake."" Drake""s white feathers were his hair and he had blue eyes, a big beak and worry lines on his forehead. He was young and kind of short, even not counting the fact that Launchpad was taller than the average duck. As Darkwing, he wore a purple costume with a gray fedora.

Text2: feelings in Georgie, but now his Faithful Friend was gone. Stone Cold and The Blonde One were the only friends he had left, aside from his still blossoming friendship with Nurse Nadine. Stone Cold was in a meeting with Milo""s brother and Lulu was avoiding him because he had tried to get her to admit that she had feelings for the Septic Son. He was always honest with her and he wished she would be honest with him instead of getting angry with him and then avoiding him for days or weeks at a time. She had been angry with him before, but she had never used Logan to force him to go away before. There was a huge hole in his life now. Before, when Lulu wanted him gone, he could confide in Georgie. She had never pushed him away or gotten angry with him for his feelings. Now his only source of comfort and true friendship, other than Stone Cold, was gone. He had never felt so alone in his life. ""Some people have to follow their heart, even if it leads them into disaster,"" she had told him once. Georgie had definitely done that. She had gone into the park alone to meet the man who wanted to kill her sister and had become his victim instead. Spinelli""s feelings of guilt came to the surface again. She had come to him for help with finding information on Cooper, but when she had needed him, he hadn""t been there. Over the past few days, he had to fight to keep his most vivid memory of her from being the last one, finding her dead in the park. He didn""t want that to be the memory that came to the surface every time he thought of his Faithful Friend.","{""output"": ""YES""}"

They all got up and headed towards the woods. It was indeed much darker and cooler there. They walked through the thick cover of trees, until they were about halfway through. Syaoran grabbed Sakura""s wrist. ""Kinomoto-chan."" He said, in the same stilted voice. ""Come with me. There is something I need to show you."" Sakura looked confused. She slowly nodded, still highly suspicious of his strange behavior. He took her deeper into the woods, leaving Tomoyo and Meiling together, and very confused. ""What is it that you wanted to ask me, Li-kun?"" Sakura asked. Li looked over his shoulder at her, a sly grin on his lips. ""You will see. Come with me."" Sakura broke his wrist grab and stepped away from him. ""No, Li! Tell me now where you are taking me! You""ve been acting strange all day."" He turned around, exasperated. ""Sakura, come on-"" he froze immediately, realizing his slip. Seeing that his cover had been blown, he quickly flew into a punch, aimed at her face. She too, had been on guard ever since he had called her ""Sakura"" and was ready for it, dodging under his blow. Li was no longer smiling. His featured contorted into rage. ""Come back!"" He screamed. He dove for her, but she was too quick, sidestepping. He fell onto the ground, rolling. She took advantage of his position to quickly take the Clow Key out of her pocket. ""O Key, that hides the power of the dark, by covenant reveal thy true form to me!"" The key glowed blue, grew longer. ""This, Sakura commands! RELEASE!"" She grabbed the fully transformed Sealing

Shrugging, Isumi took his hand off the phone and told the restaurant to add another bowl to the order. Hikaru looked up at his ceiling, unable to erase from his mind the encounter. It was no good, Touya didn""t believe him. That meant nobody else would believe him. He threw the go stone he had been clutching in his fist at the ceiling, still lying on his bed. With a satisfying knock, it stopped against the wood and flew back down into his waiting, outstretched arm. He threw it again, welcoming any distraction from the turmoil of fear and confusion inside his head. A knocking, not from go stone on ceiling, distracted him from catching it on it""s way down. He turned his head towards the door, his cheek pressed up against his pillow. The stone fell and hit him on the side of the head, drawing a curse. The knocking at the door continued. ""Come in!"" Hikaru said, his voice hoarse from disuse. The door creaked open, and two familiar heads peered through the open space. Hikaru""s head lolled back up towards the ceiling as he groaned. Guests were the last thing he needed. ""Oi, Shindou!"" Waya called from across the room. Hikaru closed his eyes. He could hear the door to his room being shut, and two pairs of feet crossing the carpeted floor to his bedside. ""Shindou-kun?"" Isumi poked his prostrate body. Hikaru groaned in reply, not moving. ""We brought you some ramen!"" his friend said, and Hikaru could hear the crinkling of a bag, the aroma of noodles assaulting his senses, but he did not move, silently willing them away.

He shielded his face to protect himself, then continued to break them off his legs and arms. ""Where""s Yami?' he thought frantically, struggling to keep the vines away from him as more came out from the ground. He looked downwards and saw them crawling around his Puzzle. ""No!!"" he yelled, ripping the Puzzle away from him and throwing it roughly a metre away. It was getting too much; no matter how hard he tried, he couldn""t resist the darkness around him. He smashed more and vines as more and more came from the ground, tightening around his body. ""YAMI, HELP!!"" he yelled, more desperate than before. His vision blurred as he stared helplessly at the door. The vines tightened around his arms, then pulled them to his side, and his head fell downwards, weak. ""Yami..."" he gasped weakly, seconds later, the vines shattered around him and the Puzzle and he collapsed to the ground, motionless. Yami banged into the door again and it flew open. ""Yugi!"" he ran over and knelt down beside him. ""Yugi, wake up!"" ""He won""t wake."" Sierra said grimly. Hayley looked at her, surprised. ""Why?"" she demended.

I fell backwards a little and struggled to catch my balance. ""That""s interesting,"" I said. ""I know much about fighting,"" she replied. I came at her again, staggering a bit, a little on purpose.

""Now why would I want to do that?"" she asked and struck out at my legs, slashing into the other one, though not as bad as the first hit she had gotten on me. She jumped up and moved to strike again and I dodged out of the way. Her crew began to cheer her on as she lunged at me again and this time, as I protected my front, she kicked my side.

As the two attempted, in vain, to pin the other Numbuh one crept around them and stole the couch. The three non-fighting members of the team spent several moments watching their fighting teammates in a shared silence before talking.

A motionless form lay hidden beneath the comfort and warmth of a pale pink blanket. At first glance the room seemed quite plain with pale coloured walls, a few books placed neatly on a desk and a lone photograph displayed beside a big bed. Though the room did seem plain, the person who still lay sleeping wasn""t and neither was the person in the photograph. The picture beside the bed had captured a moment in time not too long ago. The frame held a photo of a young woman, Kyoko Honda. A bright smile lighted up her kind face and vibrant orange locks fell just beneath her ears. She had been wild in her day, being called ""The Red Butterfly"" in her gang. It was said that the taillights of her motorbike were like butterfly wings flashing as she sped by. Though some thought her reckless and too carefree, she had a kind soul and a pure heart. These were special qualities that could also be found in her only child, Tohru Honda. Tohru was special, no doubt about it. With her long brown tresses and her sparkling teal eyes, Tohru had a bright personality and a big heart. Always polite and friendly, Tohru Honda was the optimistic type. She always looked on the brighter side of things, always looking for a silver lining on a cloudy day; especially when her mother died in an unfortunate car accident. Though it was extremely hard for her, Tohru had been brave and she faced all the days that followed. Of course, her two best friends were there to support her every step of the way.

He grunted and smiled, then grabbed and started tickling me. I giggled loudly, making everyone else jump. They had just woken up as well, still stiff with sleep. They laughed at us, we were obviously newly mated. I shoved Edward away and kissed his cheek. ""Are you going to catch me a mountain lion today?"" I asked licking my hand and wiping the dirt off of him. He smiled and kissed my forehead, thanking me for cleaning him. We walked out of the cave, welcoming the light that warmed our skin.

Either way, he was more concerned with Stiles""s recovery, which was surprisingly fast for someone who had 4 broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, sprained ankle and 5 gashes down his chest and back. At first it was little things. Stiles would look down at his phone and grin, texting back whoever it was and then staring intently at his phone until they responded before repeating the process. He would catch his son staring off into space with a light smile at the corner of his mouth and his eyes focused on something in the bare air. Often though he would be jerked from his daydreaming though when his phone went off, as it always did throughout the day. Then, one Saturday afternoon about a month ago, he caught Stiles leaving the house wearing one of his nicer plaid button downs, with one of his few pairs of unripped jeans. His hair, which had grown out longer over the past few months, was carefully styled with gel.

She fiddled with the larger black band on her right wrist before fixing the smaller black band and black string on her left. Clipping a silver chain to the right side of her hips, 74-sama looked at the two chains around her neck: one had a silver plate and one had a green omamori.

She snapped her fingers as a rift appeared before- Plop! ""Muhuhuhu~! My cosplay is COMPLETE~!"" - she cackled as a silver octopus made itself comfortable on her head. Yes! The master has mastered the art of looking like Hayato Gokudera. Most particularly - the hairstyle. Truly identical. Now then... ""MUST. FIND. UMAs!"" She declared striking a pose and cackling, ""Kekekeke~!"" ""But!"" Came the sudden thought, ""Where can a devilish soul find such a being...?"" Cradling her chin, 74-sama closed her eyes in thought. And so, she thought... and thought... and thought until- ""Wait, since I""m not human, does that make me a UMA...?"" -and- BOOM! -a lightbulb exploded overhead. ""EUREKA!"" She exclaimed before wriggling around with her hands on her blushing cheeks, ""I""M A UMA~!"" Her canines flashed in a toothy grin before she pointed towards the sunset, ""NOW, I MUST GO TORTURE A CERTAIN TAKO HE-DO!"" But, as she got ready to prance on ahead with her plan, a certain three-tailed fox held her back. Now, you may wonder why Go-chan has three tails instead of two like Announcer-san said in Crack 02: Go-chan""s Return and the answer""s simple: He got stronger. But,","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Hikaru""s eyes went back to Shinji as she calculated if there was a chance she could give him a good pounding before Rider got to her. Yup. She could do that. Maybe not an actual pounding, but one good punch would be good enough for her. Right in the jaw so he wouldn""t be able to eat correctly for a while. And perhaps lose a couple teeth. That would be great too! Rider took a step towards Hikaru with the dagger in hand but stopped after just one step. ""What""s wrong Rider?"" snapped Shinji. ""Teach her a lesson!"" ""You must be her Servant,"" said Rider. It was then that Hikaru noticed the crackling of prana in the air. She turned her head to the direction Rider was ""looking"". There he was, Gilgamesh, her Servant. His hands were in his pant pockets and he looked like he was out for a nice, relaxing stroll. Well, everything but his crimson eyes that seemed to be blazing with the intensity of a thousand suns. ""I was wondering what was taking you so long to get home my Queen so I came to look for you."" His eyes looked down to Rider""s chain around Hikaru""s leg. ""I will have you know that the only one allowed to tie up my Queen up is me."" He would. ""Really now!?"" she snapped. ""I""m currently at risk for dying and you had to make a comment like that!?"" A grin spread across his face but wasn""t his devilish playful grin. Instead it looked downright malicious. ""In any situation your comments amuse me."" Ugh. Why did it

Hikari was confused to what they were talking about. She looked back and forth between Owen and Kathy but none offered an explanation. She opened her mouth to speak but after the first sound left her mouth Kathy hissed for her to be quiet. The blonde woman turned and quickly walked back to Owen and Hikari. ""Come on. We need to get above ground before that thing catches up to us. Fighting down here is not in our best interest."" ""Where are we closest to?"" asked Owen. His blue eyes kept shifting up to the path ahead of them like whatever they could sense would come at any second. ""The graveyard,"" replied Kathy grimly. ""I thought going a round-about route would work in our best interest but..."" ""That should be fine. No one usually goes there."" Kathy winced and looked back again. It was like she knew what was going to happen. Hikari wished she did. She didn""t even understand what was going on at the moment! ""Fine then."" Her green eyes shifted to Hikari. ""Can you run fast?"" ""Huh?"" Owen placed one arm on her shoulder and yanked Hikari backwards. She hit a wall, her head banged against the stone painfully. Clearing the spots from her eyes she looked up at see a huge red-furred wolf where Owen had stood. Kathy was right next to him. She was drawing the sword out of the sheath. From the way the blade was shaped, Hikari guessed it was a katana, a sword with one flat side. Her eyes shifted to what they were facing. Her stomach dropped. A huge shadow","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Suddenly footsteps were heard and I attempted to look towards who it was. It was Jasmine. ""Your head."" She told me softly, seeing as the other two weren""t going to answer me any time soon. ""It has a terrible wound. The dark eco in your blood has stopped it from spilling anymore. Usually, this doesn""t happen but you have an unnatural amount in the body; even as a Kamelotian."" ""...So what does that mean?"" I asked her as Zidane let go of my head gently, but I could still feel his gaze on my head. ""It means...if you start bleeding from your head again..."" The older twin trailed off, clenching his fists as he gritted his teeth together. His eyes were shut tight as he looked away from me. He looked like he was about to cry. Zidane gently placed his hand over mine. ""...It means you""re...most like to die."" He gripped tightly as my eyes widened. ""What?"" I said barely above a whisper. Jasmine nodded her head. ""You cannot slam you head against anything or that will most likely be the cause of your death."" I could feel myself shaking slightly. ""Normally, I would have been able to heal it but I can""t since your body harnesses dark eco and I will purify you if I even try...which will also result into your death.""

It struck every man to the core, and an astounding flow of adrenaline raced through Éomer""s blood, so strong that his horse danced beneath him. Now was the time. Now would be the greatest war against Sauron that had yet occurred. Now Rohan would rise, rise, rise in the legends and stories of greatness! Here on these fields, beneath the great sky, for all that was good and right! ""Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered! A sword day...a red day...ere the sun rises!"" Spears were lowered, aimed and ready towards the awaiting evil. Everything suddenly was silent, all breaths held in anticipation, all horses still in preparation. Théoden urged his horse into a smooth canter, floating like air before his troops as his sword was raised high, sliding in encouragement across the prepared spears, an unspoken sign of respect, of honor, and of pride. ""Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride to ruin and the world""s ending!"" The king""s great horse, the mighty stallion Snowmane, pivoted, turning to face the wicked armies that lay before Rohan""s best. ""Death! Death! Death!"" The king""s cry was echoed in jubilation and power by his men, encouraging their king in return for his encouragement to them, and then Éomer drew in his breath, waiting for the charge, waiting for the call that would send them into a suicidal situation where the odds of winning were horrifically slim. ""Forth Èorlingas!"" The ram""s horns were sounded, the only sound heard across the entire field for a few split seconds. The mighty warriors of Rohan felt as though their hearts were about to beat out of their chests as their

James played back, winking at her. She blushed crimson, and he grinned at her response. ""Now I know why you wear no makeup. You create your own,"" James teased. Autumn gasped and aimed to throw one of her shoes at him. He took off running across the beach, and she chased after him, laughing with delight and squealing as he danced around her. She hadn""t played such games since she was a child, and truth be told, she did, at the moment feel as wild and unburned as a ten-year-old. ""Great Scott!"" Aunt Ellen exclaimed as Autumn trotted into the kitchen and set her books on the table. The older woman had never seen her niece so flustered. The young woman""s brunette waves were in complete disarray, windswept, about her face. Her blouse was wrinkled, the bottom of her skirt was drenched, and her legs and feet were covered with sand. Despite the disarray, however, there was a beautiful smile and a brilliant glow radiating from the young lady""s face. ""Oh Aunt Ellen, I had so much fun!"" Autumn exclaimed, collapsing in a chair. ""What on earth did you children do?"" Aunt Ellen questioned. ""We raced on the beach, and once James fell in the water, only barely managing to rescue my school books. He taught me how to dance the Charleston and the Jitterbug!"" Autumn jumped to her feet and showed off some of the steps. She then flung her arms around her aunt, hugging her tightly.

Strangely enough the destruction of Blastia helped sever some of the hatred amongst the social classes. Other Mana Blastia were still being created, Yuri guessed that Barrier Blastia would be the last Blastia created maybe not at all due to the complexity of Blastia which left Yuri in a daze whenever he tried to understand them. In general technology had regressed but was slowly being recreated in a healthier, more environmentally friendly way. Yuri grinned as he stared up the large steps leading to the Royal Quarter, even from where he stood he could see the look of disgruntled nobles who suffered the most from the fall of Aer powered Blastia and this rage was commonly directed at him. Yet it amused him that the nobles had to learn to do things themselves just like everyone else, it was an unexpected bonus of saving the world. Without caring for their glares and instead relishing in them, Yuri walked up the steps unperturbed; Repede at his side seemed to feel the same way as his master. As they reached the top of those high steps, which were intended to represent how nobles were above all else, Yuri smirked as he did his best to lock eyes with as many nobles he could. The anger in their eyes was as clear as day, but they would never voice such thoughts. Most nobles are cowards after all.

""Anyway,"" I said, ""I need to get a new dress for Malon."" Saria helped me get what I was looking for, and then I left. When I finally got to the ranch, Malon was up. ""I went out and got this for you, and I also ran into an old friend of mine from the forest. Her name is Saria, you should meet her,"" I said, cheerfully. She smiled, and i walked up to her.

They wait until the next to last night to hit any of the casinos. Scully is reluctant at first, but Mulder insists that they take at least one night for themselves, and she eventually agrees after they listen to the kids argue about what they want to watch on one of the suite""s TVs.

Integra found her eyes drawn to the body of Melissa Owens, her life""s blood pooled underneath her.

Some of the voices belong to the dead while others resemble the living, who could just as well be dead. She tries to shrink further into the cushions but its soft solidity will not allow her. She is still in the land of the living and unfortunately, only unearthly spirits are given the privilege of breaching the constraints of reality and allowed to flutter through the air; light, free and unrestrained.

Memories of another girl, who had little to worry about and much to learn.

The warrior couldn""t make out anything out of the ordinary. Nothing. Sure, the storm had seemed to be moving a little faster than normal, vomiting forth deep rolls of thunder at an alarming rate, but storms blew through the plains all the time. Herobrine had clutched at the blood-soaked bandages wrapped around his midsection. Still in pain. ""Someone saw me."" ""Someone saw me..."" Ridan murmured, his mind lost on that night. That fateful night. ""You saw him? You saw us?"" ""Yes, I did."" Ridan""s strange companion was now fully visible. She was tall, taller than Ridan, and slender in a fragile way, yet her dark-rimmed eyes cast a gaze that could bore through steel. Pale face. Long glossy mane of raven-black hair. Thin, cracked lips. Dressed completely in plain, understated black. ""I saw you protect him with your life. So, I took it upon myself to confront the creator about it, ask him why he was letting his brother live, after..."" She shuddered a little. It was not from the cold. ""After all he had done.""

He wouldn""t fight now, not when he didn""t know whether or not Kai was all right or if he would be harmed for his rebellion. Tala understood the sound when he heard it. It was the sound of a person giving...for the time being. After how the Chinese boy had fought and persevered in his battle with Bryan all those months ago, he knew better than to believe him to be the submissive type. The younger boy was a fighter, not one to let himself be pushed around easily. But he""s not stupid either, he thought. He knows that putting up a fight will only make it worse for both him and Kai.

Kayura was busy working on at new treaty between the southern and eastern lands of the Youjakai before they turned to the war that was soon approaching. She hoped that by giving ways that a war would damage both clans that dwelled in those lands and alternatives that could benefit both, they would go against the fighting and make peace with each other. A small content smile fell across her lips as she finished the document. She did love her work a great deal, as she enjoyed keeping war from arising in the Youjakai and maintaining a favorable sense of peace and understanding. Yet, inside she was very worried. One of her guardians had slowly been pushing himself away from the others. Kayura could tell that it was not intentional, but a way for him to hold on to things that were long gone. Oh Yami, I cannot save you from your mourning, she sighed, but I can hope you pull yourself out of it. Just as she was about to deal with the treaty matters at hand the air in the room shifted and the cause of her worries stood before her. "" Why Anubis, what brings you here?"" she asked curiously.

Rin turned to look, and saw that it was a grotesque reptilian youkai. ""Aaaaaaah!"" Rin screamed, holding her arms in front of her to shield herself as the monster swiped at her with its claws. ""Shisho_ichijin!"" Katsumi yelled as she swung her sword and killed the youkai with a well-placed kamaitachi of energy flung from her blade. The youkai disintegrated, leaving behind a completely unharmed Rin. ""Are you alright, Rin?"" Katsumi asked as she knelt beside the girl. Rin nodded and smiled. ""That was cool, Katsumi-nee! It""s been a while since I saw you use your sword."" Rin said. Katsumi smiled. Yes, she hadn""t needed to use her sword much since most youkai new better than to get too close to Sesshoumaru.

Long peroxide and chlorine bleached locks were tossed angrily. ""I""m not gonna stay here all my life!"" A different tack, ""What about swimming? Surely your hair must interfere with that.""

The scientist quelled and retreated from the looming man holding the pointer in his hands. Tatsumi only ever called him ""Yutaka"" if he was angry or if the scientist was particularly distracted--in this case both probably applied. Sometimes, however, Watari felt that his antics were worth hearing his first name drop from those cultured vocal cords--no matter how much anger the word was charged with. Masochist, the scientist chided himself. ""Sorry Tatsumi..."" ""If you don""t mind Watari-san, I""d like to continue the meeting. Would you be so kind as to join us this time?""

You can only take my word for it."" He responded in a matter of fact tone. Another growl was elicited from him at the irritating response that revealed nothing and only created more questions. He was disliking this boy every passing second. ""You don""t like me very much, do you?"" The young jounin finally turned to focus his attention on him, a sad smile on his face. Minato didn""t bother to answer his current housemate, and Naruto turned his head to look away right after - seemingly expecting the silence. ""Do you have any precious people?"" He blinked. The question caught him off guard. Precious people? Once again, he refused to dignify the question with an answer, and it seemed that Naruto had already expected that, because he continued on. ""I""m sure you do. I do, too, you know. Well, I did... but I""m not sure if I""ll even get to see them again."" Saddened, sky-blue eyes were suddenly stormy with raw emotion, darkening. ""I""d do anything to protect my precious people. They were the only ones who believed in me when no one else did. They were the ones who helped me through those hard and painful times where it felt as though the world had turned on me. They stood up for me when people were cruel to me... I live for them; to protect them."" The words were spoken with raw honesty and sincerity. The blonde captain shifted uncomfortably, feeling awkward.

Sam could almost feel her wide eyes on his face, ""No-Sir! I -"" ""Relax."" He smirked at her. ""And I don""t think you have to worry about that."" She seemed to take him at his word, turning to stare at the city as it rolled by. ""Late night last night?"" Oliver asked, so casually it was impossible for Sam to miss the real question behind the words. ""Little late, yeah."" Sam loaded his gun, checked it and slid it into his holster in smooth practiced motions before turning, ""Nothing like you""re thinking."" Oliver raised both hands in surrender. ""Whatever you say Sammy."" Sam slapped him on the shoulder on his way out. In a way he was grateful for his friend""s caution.

When were you and Marcy together?!"" Finn cried, looking as hurt and confused as Bubblegum did. I watched them fight just a few feet away from me, wondering how it had come to this. Had I started this? Or was it already in motion? Did I just make it worse? No matter how it happened or what state it was in, this fight was going to continue until everything came out. I just knew it. ""When were you and Marceline together is the real question here!"" Bubblegum shouted back. Finn""s face went hot as he scowled at Marceline, upset with her for taking it this far.

She intended to hide in the pits out in the excavation and make a final stand, although how they could possibly win was beyond her. Lara saw the pits emerge from the darkness ahead of her, and knew they had reached the excavation. She pulled Susan and Carlton farther into it, searching for one of the deeper pits. Susan let out a shrill scream and Lara followed her terrified gaze as she reached for her pistols. Her hands were on the grips when she saw him, and then she was unsure whether or not she should draw. The man who had upset Susan""s frayed nerves was none other than John Nash.

In many ways, their recent ""adventures"" helped break the ice that had built up in the space of two years, helped Sherlock and John feel at home again, safe. This was normal, this was as it should be! ""All right, Sherlock?"" John asked, getting the post-panic giggles. They were contagious, and Sherlock joined in. John had gone through a two-year stretch of adrenaline withdrawal, and was happy to have finally gotten a good dose. No one could provide better than his favorite lunatic detective. How it brought everything back! Hearing his friend""s demonic chuckle along with his was music to his ears. I could listen to that all day, he thought contentedly. He sounds like Tim Curry""s long-lost son. ""I think so. You?"" He shook his head bemusedly. ""Never better. I""ll be back in shape in no time if you stick around long enough."" Sherlock had gotten his breath back by now and was searching the room for something. His far-seeing eyes scanned intensely. A slow, triumphant smile spread onto his face. ""Oh, my old friend..."" he sighed with satisfaction. He crossed near the fireplace and picked up his violin case. He opened it up and slid his hands over the surface of the instrument. He picked it up, gave the strings a pluck, and tweaked the pegs. The second he started to play, however, he realized something was amiss.

With an obedient nod as she stood from the leather couch and took the gun, she replied curtly with, ""Right. Be down there in a bit."" As she traversed the spacious living room, Lita couldn""t help but feel the hairs upon the back of her neck rise as her brother eyed her closely. There was an undecipherable glint that appeared within his brown orbs. Although Lita""s instincts immediately told her that the expression was nowhere near menacing, she couldn""t shake the feeling of discomfort from her body. Deciding to leave it and not say a word as she crossed Luis"" path, Lita merely took a deep breath before lithely hopping down the basement stairs. Briskly walking through the dimly-lit corridor, Lita dreaded what she would find in the room before her. Taking a final breath, she finally twisted the latch of the door and steadily pushed inwards.

Gwaine appeared at my side, sipping at his cup with a darkened expression. He bared teeth. ""They eye you as though you were prey."" ""Oh, come off it, Gwaine!"" I lightheartedly clinked our cups, not even paying mind to the men to which the knight was referring. I reasoned, stepping in front of him in order to block his view and alleviate the menace in his stare, ""They""re probably just not used to seeing women who look like me, that""s all."" Whether this was true or not, I decided to give those Druid men the benefit of the doubt. Setting aside my drink upon a wooden table nearby, I lithely took Gwaine""s hand in mine. This was much-needed diplomacy at work. ""Come! Let""s dance and enjoy this!"" Gwaine hesitated for a moment; then, seeing the pleading expression plastered upon my countenance, he finally obliged with a curt nod. He set aside his drink and allowed me to lead him forward. As we began to join the circle of dancing Druids around a large bonfire, I heard Merlin distinctly yell from somewhere behind us, ""Lourdes, you""re on fire!"" I laughed in glee, twisting my head in his direction. It was a bit odd that he appeared petrified. I shrugged anyway, exclaiming, ""Wow, Merlin, where did you learn how to say that? Did I teach you that or..."" At Merlin""s side, Lancelot interrupted me and tried once more, arms wildly flailing, ""No, Lourdes! Your dress is caught on fire!"" I immediately blanched. ""What?""

She saw the other children staring at her and whispering amongst themselves, and that was when she noticed that instead of wearing a school uniform like the others, she was clad in a priest""s outfit that did not fit very well. She was so preoccupied with this discovery that she did not see one boy""s outstretched foot until she tripped over it and fell down hard. ""Watch where you""re going, sewer rat!"" the boy laughed. ""What?"" Hilde sat up and tried to recover the books she had dropped, but one of the other children kicked them away. ""Phew, sure smells like a sewer rat,"" said another student, shoving her back down, ""Get lost! Don""t stink up our school!"" Other children in the hall began to laugh and point, but the clamor of vicious laughter was not enough to prevent Hilde from overhearing bits of what the students were saying: ""I heard this kid sleeps in garbage..."" ""What""s with those funny clothes?"" ""Hope this dirty kid""s not in MY class."" ""Yeah, too bad the virus didn""t get this one!"" ""Aw, you shouldn""t say that..."" ""Fine, let the dirty kid be in YOUR class, then!"" ""Yuck, no way!"" Hilde bit her lip and said nothing. She wasn""t used to such treatment... When she had been a schoolgirl, nearly everyone had wanted to be her friend. She was enraged that these students would say such hurtful things about Duo, but at least it was a step up from eating out of trashcans and seeing children dying in the streets. Rather than voice the anger she felt, she simply sat there in silence and diligently took in every cruel word the bullies said, trying to imagine the

I could hear a voice inside of me screaming not to do it, but the memory of all the nightmares of the past few weeks came roaring into my mind, drowning out that scream. Then, the roaring was gone too, and the only thing in my mind was silence. I took another step forward. The scream of protest came back into my mind. I took a moment to stare into the invitingly quiet, dark place below, and waited for silence to return to my mind, so that I could take the final step and forever be a part of that quiet darkness. It was about a year after Mayuka""s suicide. Sasami stood by the window in the hall, letting the moonlight wash over her. She folded her soft hands in front of her, fingertips gently brushing her collarbones. She longed to feel another""s hands on her. Tenchi""s hands. She smiled. Soon, very soon. A few more moments, and the assimilation with Tsunami would be truly complete. Her breath quickened with anticipation. Tenchi was in pain, but she would comfort him. She could fill the void that his daughter""s death had left in his heart. She had the love, and soon she would have the light, and then she would complete him... and he would complete her. Yes, this was how it was meant to be. She understood that now. As she had come closer to the assimilation, she had come to see that. She... Tsunami, actually... had created Tenchi. Some of Tsunami""s memories had somehow become muted, but she understood that much, at least. Tenchi, same name as the Master Key. He was her key. That had to be it.

From everything she had heard of Aeryn""s mother and father, Nikolai Odezvan and Mira Wolf, they were the strangest couple on Mobius; A human revolutionary and a she-wolf who was no reactionary either.

He hoped he could convince her, for he certainly wasn""t convincing himself. ""I am just having a little difficulty at the present time remembering some things."" The look on her face was still one of shock. ""Victoria, please ...just tell me the year."" His voice portrayed a calmness that surprised even him. ""Really, I need to know."" She told him the year and carefully studied his face. Her panic was subsiding somewhat because of his studied tone, but her mind was spinning, thinking of all the possibilities that his question had meant. The doctor had said that his injury might mean some changes in Diego, but she had never considered this! Diego""s mind was racing. Five years! He had lost five years! He was shocked and he felt he had to hide that fact. How much more could he dare risk asking? One thing he needed to know was why he was feeling so secretive. There had to be a reason for this almost ominous warning in his brain not to say too much. What was is? Should he even trust Victoria? He looked at her. This woman loved him! It was obvious. But the last he remembered of his relationship with her, his love had not been returned. Victoria had always been besieged by admirers since their childhood. The young lads of the pueblo, those closer to her own station, displayed far more courage than he ever could in efforts to win her affections. He was a caballero""s son. A de la Vega, even.

Through his travels, he once met the ultimate manifestation of a fire being, the Dragon of the Darkness Flame, a MASSIVE black flame with the head of a dragon. He manages to tap into its power and even consumes the demon itself, becoming the ultimate fire demon. He is even able to create multiple of them for massive near instant death attacks. He can also utilize darkness flames to augment his sword and body with the black flames, increasing the power of all his attacks immensely. He can also turn the Dragon of the Darkness Flame on himself, absorbing the dragon""s power and getting a full boost in power and restored energy reserves. However, he""s only shown to do this once during any given battle. His final ability for combat is his Jaganshi form. His body turns a grayish green color, gaining more muscle and tone as eyes open up all around certain points of his body, including the Jagan Eye in the center of his forehead. The Jagan Eye grants him a whole slew of telepathic abilities and can see through illusions. The Jagan Eye will often open on its own as a third eye by reflex during Hiei""s fights anyway. Once in his Jaganshi form, he gains massive boosts to speed, power, and new techniques like a paralyzing move, the Jagan Binding Curse. Hiei is very stubborn and never admits defeat easily. Despite this, he shows overwhelmingly his own combat ability as an excellent strategist and analyst. He doesn""t toy with his opponents, not believing in wasting time and effort, unless they""re so laughably below him that he wants to

This duct was smaller, about a foot in diameter, and circular, so I wrapped my legs around it and hung there like a sloth. Then I could easily move forwards by using my arms and legs to pull myself along the duct. When I got to the A/C thing, I let go with my arms and hung upside down by my legs. I could see Erek standing below me. He looked like he thought I was about to fall at any moment. I gave him a thumbs-up and looked at the air conditioning. It did look pretty loose. The bolts in two of the corners had come out, which had loosened the other two. I could pull them out without needing a screwdriver or anything. Unfortunately, it was too heavy for me, and I dropped it. Erek caught it and set it down on the floor. ""Okay, I""m going to let go now,"" I called quietly down to him. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and dropped. Erek caught me and set me down on my feet. He grinned. ""Great work, monkey-girl."" ""Thanks,"" I replied.

Another ten minutes were spent getting to the Separatist communication station. Anakin could see what Dari meant when she said they wouldn""t be spotted. While most of the buildings on the upper level were connected through a large platform, the buildings themselves were scattered across at great distances. Many of the structures rose up from the lower ring, with the platforms having been constructed to allow employees of higher status direct access to their specific place of employment. At this time of day, the platform was practically deserted, with only the occasional person moving around. ""I thought your contact was waiting for you.""

He opened the refrigerator and began to reach for a Mountain Dew, when he saw the three cans of Hieneken that he didn""t drink in his independence rave from the night before. The can of beer seemed to beckon to him: ""C""mon Double D, just one drink, you want to forget about what just happened don""t you?"" ""Y-yes..."" Edd replied, reaching for the beer.

Kirsten insisted but her argument was weak. How could you not be the princess when your dad was the king? It was like genetics or something, Seth couldn""t really blame her. But then again theoretically he should be the next prince, but maybe he was like Prince Harry ignored unless he did something bad. Also Seth didn""t really plan on becoming head of the Newport group when his mom died. He figured that if anyone from the Cohen family would it would be Ryan. After all he was at least semi-interested in it. ""Come on stay Ryan!"" Seth demanded turning towards his brother.

Eight positions as bodyguards to the sickly son of Jon Arryn would be awarded to the top competitors at the tourney, who would then serve the young Lord for three years. From the sounds of things many of the strongest knights in the Vale were travelling to compete, for Lysa Arryn, she who had so recently been murdered by a love-struck musician by the name of Marillion, had kept them out of the War of the Five Kings. Many were chomping at the bit to prove their skill at arms, mainly young men who hadn""t seen true battle. Harry, Roland and Wallace were among them, as were plenty of lordlings from all across the Vale of Arryn. Roland had a true chance of winning a position through the joust while Harry and Wallace were unlikely to do so; the competition would be fierce. Mychel Redfort, Lyn Corbray, Littlefinger""s man Lothor Brune...they were all more skilled than any of the boys seated around Hadrian. Hadrian himself could likely hold his own against them, but not on horseback; he""d have to bring them to the ground, and even then Corbray was a superior fighter.

There is a hell of a lot of completely random green code to start with, but eventually it ends. There are two security guards sitting in some place or other talking crap to each other. One leaves, then a motorcycle comes flying through the air and blows the control tower to shit. The fireball is extremely over exaggerated but looks awesome, so no one really cares. The rider of the motorcycle removes their helmet, its Trinity. ""Check me, I""m in the script so early on"" exclaimed Trinity happily. ""Oh my god"" said an extra, who wont get another line in. ""I rock, I""m gonna kick your asses!"" said Trinity. Trinity ran forward, and kicked a guard in the face. Then she sneezed and concussed the remaining three. The guard she kicked in the face was whining, so she booted him across the floor. Randomly the green code appears again, and now we are in a skyscraper.

Sephiroth had led them up to a balcony where Ansem was facing two frightened creatures that appeared to be half feline and half human. They appeared young, ten or twelve years old. Both had human builds, one a bit bigger than the other; large feline ears; a long tail; green-gold eyes and paw- like hands and feet. The larger of the two had red-brown hair and a thin scar that ran across his left eye. The smaller had black hair with a shock of white in front. Both were wide-eyed, their tails bottle-brushing as they backed against the wall. Ansem stood before them, his empty hands held up in supplication. ""They just appeared."" Sephiroth said quietly. ""Cloud came and told us. I came for you two, and Ansem came up here."" Ansem ignored the three of them, his eyes staying on the two creatures. ""We do not want to hurt you."" He said softly.

He is wearing a reddish-pink robe that is a little too large for him, making him look even thinner than he is, and it slips off his shoulder slightly showing white skin, the collarbone sticking out almost painfully. That is another thing the whisperers say, that the stranger does not eat. At all, ever. ""What do you mean?"" the stranger says in perfect Tibetan. Siger nods at him. ""Sometimes you wear a look on your face. As if you are somewhere else. You wore such a look now."" The stranger glances away, to the pool of water, watching his pale and thin face reflected almost perfectly inside it. The sun glances off the water, sending long stripes of weak light across his cheek, stroking along his long eyelashes. He looks deeply saddened, Siger thinks, on some strange incomprehensible level. ""I think of my friend,"" he says. ""I think how he would have liked it here. It is peaceful."" ""Your friend is gone forever?"" Siger hazards. The stranger shakes his head, a very slight smile touching the corner of his sunlit lips. ""No. I will see him again."" Siger thinks about this. ""Then surely this is a happy thought?"" The stranger smiles properly this time. It is quite a change; the smile lights his body up far more than the reflected sunlight can do, from head to toe he is smiling. ""Yes,"" he says. ""Yes, it is."" Siger smiles too, because it is impossible not to when such an entity beside him is doing it as well, and because he is glad that this stranger - who he thinks is more lost than anyone he had ever seen - is briefly home. Somewhere, a bell tones, and the stranger stands up abruptly. ""I must leave,""

Instead she was pleasantly relieved to feel Clarke""s mouth moving quickly, eagerly, wantonly against her own. It was different, she realised, and deliciously so because it wasn""t a kiss stolen. It was one given freely. And when Lexa moved back to look down at the panting blonde she could see a promise of many many more to come.

She knew if she stayed out any longer that she would freeze to death if she didn""t die from blood lost and shock, but she had to catch the flame. The cold was starting to take over her body and her ankle finally collapsed under the pressure of her body. There Riza lied in the snow. This couldn""t be the end. She couldn""t die yet.

Text2: atmosphere. Making slumber almost unachievable with such a surrounding temperature. Soon, Hinata was able to fine relief, completely kicking off her blankets as she turned to face her window, letting the wind brush against her face as she laid there. Drifting off to a deep sleep that she had been deprived of not moments ago. That lovely lullaby, sung by the wondering existence of the darkness, soon put the Kunoichi into a deep slumber. Leaving behind a resting female, having only the moons iridescent glow to blanket her body for warmth. Oh how such a simple thing could heal all her ails, just by receiving a decent nights rest. If only it would last though. But, as with everything, dreams must come to an end at some point in time. For within her state of rest, there were images of scattered memories being played out in a saddening sequence; something the female""s subconscious put together without hesitation. One might call it a dream; but for others who know this all too well, Hinata, was indeed, having a nightmare. For in the state of abstraction, she could hear the weeping of a fragile soul; a broken girl whom everyone had forgotten, but where was it coming from? From where the Hyuuga was standing, nothing could be seen, nothing but the solid black of darkness creeping in around her timid form from every direction. Shadows were everywhere, consuming everything in sight and in mind; this giving the atmosphere a choking feeling that caused the Kunoichi""s stomach to sink into a bottomless pit of despair. She could feel the hands of people she couldn""t see, grasping at her clothing, jerking her and tugging at her form until she was nearly toppled over from the struggling. Though she couldn""t see their faces, she could","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He was in his seventh year, and I was in my sixth. He was in Gryffindor, and I was in Hufflepuff. It could be worse I guess. Melissa is the name. Nice to meet you. I should tell you about me. I""m pretty tall for the girls in my year, and in some cases, I can tower over some of the guys. I have stick straight, dirty blonde hair that just reached my shoulders that curled upward at the end for no apparent reason. I""m normal I guess for weight; doctors or parents aren""t complaining. I""m not the smartest in my year, but I""m not stupid either. I""m in the middle. I""m passing, and it""s good for me. No teacher has anything against me. Only problem: I have no love life. Being raised three older brothers, I""ve come to be a bit of a tomboy... okay, I""m basically considered a boy in my house until it""s special occasions, so I have to dress up. I love Quidditch, and I""m good at it. So good, I""m a Chaser on the Hufflepuff team. With that being said though, I have basically talked with the male population and don""t find myself relating to girls very well. I also hate wearing this skirt-it""s too bloody itchy. So, as you can see, it""s kinda weird for me to be fancying a boy. Physically, I do carry most of my mother""s traits.

""You need another drink?"" I asked, brandishing towards his almost empty glass. His eyes widened slightly in surprise. He looked down at his glass, then back up at me. ""For...me?"" he asked slowly. I laughed. I knew that he probably wasn""t of age yet. He was probably sixteen, and in all the ""magical"" pubs they had loose guidelines for you to be seventeen before they would sell any to you. I say loose, because there was no way for them to really tell unless you had your Apparating license, which many wizards didn""t even bother with. Plus, Malfoy looked old enough anyways. I doubted that they would even ask. Still though, I didn""t want him to get into trouble. Ugh. Looking out for a Slytherin. I would have been beaten by my old team if they ever found out. But this wasn""t Quidditch. This was drinking, and in it, everyone played nice. Well, usually. ""Yeah, for you,"" I said, still chuckling. He smiled slightly and nodded, looking away. If I didn""t know any better, I would say he was...shy. A far stretch from the stories I had heard, that was for sure. ""Er...thanks,"" he said, scratching the back of his head.

I sat still, my mind free of any thoughts, night and day blurring together as time felt faster, almost as if someone was watching a sped up movie. |-INSERT THE NAME OF YOUR CHARACTER-| Time slowed to a halt. A screen appeared in front of me. I sighed. I had no idea what I should name my character. Using my name from my old world would be stupid, so my conflicted mind created and reviewed several names that sounded nice and names that I personally liked. Kanzaki won for reasons that I do not consciously know. Is ""Kanzaki"" correct? A smaller menu appeared in front of the menu that I had used to type my new name in, and it looked nicer than the large white letters on a black background, ""Kanzaki is correct,"" I muttered in a raspy tone that sounded exactly like my old voice. Not to deep, but smooth and flowing and laced with kindness that was most likely hard to find these days...I knew I was being arrogant, but Kurumi and Akane had once described my voice to sound exactly like that. Do you want to combine souls with Issei Hyoudou? There is a wide range of beings you can choose from! I was confused, having no clear idea on what the message had meant, my mind working to figure out what that message could entail.

You will now be attached to Issei

They had trekked all the way back to Gold Saucer in order to obtain the Keystone from Dio, only to have the man tell them that they could have it in a couple of days. As in, not at the moment. As in, if Cid was anyone to judge, when he felt like giving it to them, and who knew when that would happen? He""d been all for just stealing the thing and busting their way out, but unfortunately he had found himself voted down. A majority of the members had already enjoyed a fabulous, all-expense paid vacation in the prison and they had no interest in repeating that experience ever again. So Cloud had reluctantly agreed not to do anything illegal such as theft. It was fairly obvious that with the world at stake, the ex-SOLDIER was going to be in a bit of a hurry, but either Dio didn""t notice or didn""t care, and they had no choice but to sit on their asses for a couple more days until the Gold Saucer owner was ready to hand the blasted thing over. All of that was enough to put their leader in a pet mood, but Cid still didn""t know why it had to get taken out on him. Of course, he knew on some basic level that Cloud wasn""t doing this on purpose, just as he had long ago realized that Vincent wasn""t a bad person... but it didn""t change the fact that the gunner was just plain creepy.

A little later than I planned, but I hope you like it! Today is Saturday and as usual I was doing nothing. With nothing to do I found myself opening the wallet I found yesterday to try and find a way to return it to that girl. I stared at the school id that was in the wallet and tried to think whether I had seen that school before. The name didn""t seem familiar. Closing it back up i turned it around in my hands, thinking of how to return it to her. There was a knock on my door. Quickly hiding it I went to open the door. ""Time for breakfast!"" Mom said before I even had it all the way open. ""Ok."" I followed her down and settled at the table while she served the food. We ate our food in a comfortable silence. Suddenly, I got a strange feeling like I couldn""t stay in the house anymore. I needed to go out. ""Mom, is it ok if I go out?"" I asked, smiling brightly. It was hard to miss the worry in her eyes as she bit her lip. I hated to see her so worried. I wish I could tell her that there

The air seemed heavy, and I leaned against the swing, the cool wood a relief against my warm skin. ""Lizzie? Do you wanna dance?"" Eric asked nervously, biting his lip. I sighed, nodding slowly.

She found most of them to be overrated, like she was supposed to like them just because everyone else did and that was how they became popular in the first place, but there were a few that she genuinely enjoyed. Every time Clint made a joke about some new book she hadn""t read, she would sneak out at night and buy it. If he ever wondered where their money disappeared to, he never asked, but she suspects he knows, and makes the references on purpose so she will know what to read. She had really liked Harry Potter, especially when it had looked like the series may actually have ended with Potter""s death. She""d mentioned that to Clint after she""d finished it, and he""d laughed and said it had to be the Russian in her, to hope to go through all that literature only for it to end in a tragedy. She had briefly thought he was making fun of her, until she read some of the Russian classics. However, there were some parts of Harry Potter that she had not liked. Too clean an ending notwithstanding, she had never quite bought what had bought Harry, Ron and Hermione together as friends. Growing up, she had faced far worse things than a fictional mountain troll and had never bonded with the people that had been there with her. They had faced dangers together, but they did not suddenly become friends afterwards, and especially not if the only reason she was in danger in the first place was because one of the other members of her team had made some mistake that forced her to be there.

But then, this was a woman who had faced down muggers, murderers, district attorneys, and big city editors and who claimed the planet""s most powerful being as a friend and possible lover. He showed her the structure, the various nooks and crannies, watching her reaction. He dared to caress her neck, smiling shyly at her.

Superman hurried around the world to gather dinner for the two of them. It wasn""t often that he got to show off this way. The Fortress created a table with two chairs and two place settings in crystal and silver. ""What else is missing?"" he asked her as he poured the wine. ""For the very first time in my life - nothing at all,"" Lois replied, watching him. Her expression was full of love. It was what he had always wanted, but he was filled with trepidation. It was too easy. He was going to wake up in his apartment in Metropolis and it would all be a dream. He leaned in to kiss her and found she was trembling at his touch. She pulled him to her, fingers weaving into his hair as though she was as afraid as he was, that this was all a dream. The kiss sent shivers down his spine. It was beyond anything he had ever dreamed. ""Where did you learn to do that...?"" Lois whispered when they finally separated. ""Here... just now..."" he confessed.

It was free today if you got in before eleven and Jack had found waking Ralph up that morning to be quite amusing. Ralph, of course, had been shocked, enraged, and now had completed the metamorphosis to sullen. It was just after ten o""clock; they had been walking past an old church when the bells started to chime, shattering the silence. Ralph had jumped and even Jack had been hard-pressed to hide his surprise. The bells had sounded deep and old, weary and warning. Still silent, Jack walked to the furthest reaches of the museum, past the fun exhibits that children and adults alike preferred to walk through. The third floor was where the older exhibits, most of them about Eastern cultures, were slowly moldering away. ""What""s the game this time?"" Ralph asked in a whisper, sarcasm warring with apprehension and anger in his voice. Jack kept walking, not deigning to answer. After a long moment, Ralph followed him. ""Why do you suppose they put carpets on display?"" Jack asked, leaning over the guard rail to get a better look at the Oriental rugs on display on the far wall. Ralph was looking over his shoulder, obviously hoping that someone else would join them in the exhibit, but at the question he turned. ""Why are you asking me stupid questions?"" ""No question is stupid,"" Jack replied, turning to stare at Ralph quizzically. The other boy frowned and looked away from his scrutiny. ""Even questions that seem totally obvious have value. Do you know why?"" ""I don""t know what you""re talking about,"" Ralph said, looking at the carpets and trying to ignore Jack""s presence.

Soon after another part of the burning stage came down, blocking the entrance to the lair. Everyone applauded Raoul for his bravery and pitied him for being witness to his loves demise. The story kept and everyone believed that the infamous Phantom was gone. Unable to let the once beautiful opera house sit in ruin, the people of France petitioned to have The Opera Populaire fixed. Workers were brought in and set to their job on bringing the great opera house back to life. Soon the iconic building was restored to its original state. All its elegance, beauty, and mystic had been brought back. Two new managers came in as well, Monsieur Claude Dawson and Monsieur Luc Leroy. The two men implored Raoul to return as their patron. He agreed without a second thought. He would be able to return to the place where he lost Christine. He wasn""t sure what he would find, but Raoul couldn""t give up on her like she asked him to. Raoul was convinced that Christine still loved him. The last words she had said to him were out of fear. She stayed with that horrible creature of darkness to save him. For if she hadn""t, he knew that the Phantom would never let them be. Meanwhile, Erik and Christine had made a new home in a small opera house just outside Paris. Erik adopted a new persona he could use to conduct music and give criticism to this theater. However upon hearing that their old home had been rebuilt, they both agreed upon returning. Together with their daughter, Ariadne, they made it back to The Opera Populaire. NOTE: So I hope you guys like

""What do I need a book for?"" Before Sanzo could launch into another outburst of paper fan abuse, Hakkai intercepted the question. ""A thesaurus, Goku, is a book which helps you find the right words to use in a certain situation. By applying a variety of words, it makes one""s speech less redundant."" Goku stared blankly. Through his teeth, Sanzo gritted out, ""It will broaden your vocabulary and make you seem smarter."" ""Ohh..."" The boy wrinkled his nose in obvious distaste. Turning the book over again in his hands, he asked petulantly, ""Do I have to?"" Once again, Hakkai smoothly cut in before another verbal or physical diatribe could burst. ""I""ll tell you what, Goku. After dinner, we""ll play a game and see what we can do from there."" Gojyo seemed to have caught on, because he added, ""Winner gets the extra dumplings and the bed furthest from the window."" The cold season was beginning to fall the further west they traveled. For this reason, when an inn could be found, there were often squabbles (usually just between Goku and Gojyo, as they were normally roommates in these cases) over who got to sleep furthest away from the frigidity. The problem could be easier solved by simply requesting a thicker blanket, or even another layer, but that defeated the purpose for those two. Goku lost horribly that night.

She was just taking a small walk around, she had just moved to the bustling city from a rural area not too long ago, and she was already used to hearing a lot about the miltary and the State Alchemists. She found one in particular (No, not Armstong). She found the youngest State Alchemist and the hero of the people, Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist, to be the most intriging. She didn""t have a crush on him (although, she could name a few people who she has already met that probably make out with a poster of him or something both male and female) she just found him amazing. Maybe it was the fact that he was the youngest State Alchemist; gaining the title of Fullmetal at the age of twelve? Or was it the fact that he had automail and that his younger brother was in a seven foot suit of armor? She didn""t know the exact reason she found him so cool. She had always been in some kind of trance when she heard stories about him, and when ever he got hurt, she knew deep in her gut that he was okay.

She decided that as the maid of honor she should hold it together. Especially since Santana was fairly certain that Quinn would be absolutely horrible on the actual wedding day. After an hour and a half of practice, the whole party felt confident enough to be done. Everyone rushed home to their hotels and apartments to change into formal dinner clothes. Santana stayed with Quinn and helped her relax. The dinner went without a hitch even though it was the first time both families were pushed together. Santana didn""t have any time to talk to Brittany between all the introductions and whatnot. By the time the whole thing was over, Santana was ready to go get drunk at Quinn""s bachelorette party.

Several months ago, Melody had been driving home from practice with her father when a speeding semi ran a red light and slammed into the car. It had caught the back end and the car had swung around, the bumper sliding under the back of the semi. Strapped to a support on the side was an odd-looking staff. When she regained consciousness amidst the flashing lights of emergency vehicles, she was clutching the piece of wood as if her life depended on it. She could hear voices, some in English, some in a language that sounded Asian. Maybe Japanese. She didn""t know. She hurt too much to care. ""There""s a girl over here!"" ""She""s hurt! Bring a stretcher!"" ""He""s dead..."" ""Her father?"" ""Poor girl."" ""Stand back, please!"" Opening her eyes, she saw two worlds. One was full of flashing lights and screaming voices, the other a quiet forest clearing. Shying away from the lights, she followed the staff in her hand to the clearing, lying down under a bush at the edge to rest. She""d been awoken by voices nearby. She couldn""t understand the language, but was sure now that it was Japanese, and the same one she""d heard before. Once again forcing her eyes open, she saw a group of women staring down at her.

Quatre always liked to take some sort of interest in his friends, so he was trying to give the marathon a chance, Ed...well Ed was a female version of Duo, except the woman was insane. Wufei still did not understand how Trowa and Ed ended up together. It boggled the mind, at least Quatre and Faye made sense, and they both had tactical minds like steel traps.

Derek wasn""t quite sure if should be in here but he stayed anyhow, ""Um Sure. Any preferences?"" ""Well I""m a sucker for a happy ending. Whatever it is can you make it end happily."" He smiled at her, ""Well okay. There once was this place in a faraway land where there lived this girl named, ""Casey"", Casey wasn""t just your average girl though. Although she was very pretty she had the power to clean everything in sight and turn any person into a super keener. One day while she was out doing her homework.

Text2: A rebellion occurred in Falena. No other nation knew about this-except for Harmonia, their ally, with an almost unshakeable allegiance. Poor Selena. Sasarai thought, gazing out from the window of his carriage. Looking out at the road towards Celesta, the capital of Falena, Sasarai would never have believed that it was a land rent by rebellion just a couple of days ago. The Queendom of Falena is definitely one of the most marvelous States in the Known World. And now, she will have to bear its burden... Sasarai sighed sadly. Oh Selena... How can this happen to her, is there any justice in the world?? Sasarai frowned. He was not much older than her, he had just turned 12... but he often feels much, much older than she was. And an impulse to protect her. No, it is not fair for Selena to be catapulted unto the throne like so. I may be young, but I""ve always known when they will turn me into High Priest... when I turn 13... But Selena never had time to prepare. What a cruel world. Ever since Selena was born, she and Sasarai had been engaged. A fixed marriage, but it certainly would not be a forced one-they had loved each other since childhood. Uh, early childhood. Sasarai corrected himself, realizing they were still children after all. ""When we grow up, I will take you away from here."" Sasarai vowed; his mouth set in a stubborn line. ""No matter what happens."" ""You don""t have to do that... I will marry you Sasarai..."" Selena smiled sweetly at him. ""I will never marry anyone else...and when the Queen says never, she means never!"" ""You""re not Queen though,"" Sasarai said dubiously. ""Not now, but I will be."" Selena giggled. ""Ah, Selena."" Sasarai sighed. The moment after he","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Shizuo said glaring at him, he was getting mad now just remembering how this person, this, this flea. Ruined his life.

You wanna fuck with my life to get back at me or something?"" Izaya said with a chuckle. Shizuo stared at Izaya absentmindedly. The brunet stared at Shizuo. ""Hm, it looks like the lights are on, but no ones home.' Izaya thought as he suppressed a giggle. The only thing that Shizuos minds registered was, ""You wanna fuck."" after that his mind went blank, thinking back to his dreams. Just the thought of the man in front of him under his control.

Drayden then grit his teeth as the smoke cleared and Zarc was completely fine. ""Damn, how did you survive?!"" ""It""s a little thing called Kuriboh, lets me send it from my hand to the graveyard to make the damage 0. Also, since Starve Venom just bit the dust, it""s safe to assume you know what comes next.""

Text2: Chapter 2 - The Beginning When Jack awoke all he felt was pain. He got the feeling that he""d just been put through a blender. He struggled to sit up, and discovered that he was not in his little ""room"" on the sleeping mat, but in a real bed. He glanced around and recognized the room he was in as the temple""s infirmary. His left arm was in a cast and he was practically covered in bandages. He sighed as his thoughts turned from his injuries to his fight with Chase. He reached up and pushed his blazing red hair from his eyes. ""Jack Spicer. You are awake."" The old master of the temple""s voice came from his side and he looked up into Master Fung""s solemn face. ""I guess so,"" Jack said, not bothering to quip about Master Fung""s ability to point out the obvious. He noticed the bed-tray in the master""s hands. It had a teapot and two cups on it. Master Fung sat in a chair and placed the tray on the bed in front of Jack. Jack took the pot and pored both of them some tea. ""We have much to discuss, young one."" He picked up his cup and took a sip. ""How long was I out for?"" ""A week. And two days."" Jack nodded and took a sip of tea as well. It burned his tongue. ""You fought well against Chase Young,"" the master began. ""Well? I got my ass...er...I lost, sir. Horribly."" ""Remember, there are no lessons in victory, but a...""

Suddenly, Maureen laughed, loudly, twisting a strand of curly hair around her finger. ""What is she doing?"" Abeth whispered, a smile pulling at her lips.

Would you---"" he suddenly stopped, and shook his head. ""I mean---"" Is he going to ask me if I want to go out with him? If so then the rumors of him and Meling breaking up must be true! Oh my God!

""My autograph?"" I asked. ""Autograph...what?"" I felt horrible. There I was picturing him and I together and all he wants is a stupid autograph. Instead of exploding, I felt my heart slowly crumble. He nodded. ""Yeah. We can exchange autographs, just in case one of us gets famous."" He eyed me over and smiled a fake smile. ""You know, it would be cool."" I narrowed my brows at him. He hardly made any sense, however I felt something different with the way he was acting.

Before Damian could register what had happened the warmth of Cameron""s lips were gone and he became confused. ""Cam...what?"" Damian trailed off as Cameron linked their hands together. ""Maybe I didn""t hate you kissing me after all."" Cameron smiled sheepishly; Damian laughed for the first time in hours and smiled along with Cameron. Suddenly, he didn""t feel as numb anymore.

And being the kind hearted innocent soul he was, (""You""ve never been to a strip club before, Ai-chan?!"") he couldn""t say no when his fellow classmates invited him to go. But as he stood staring at the doorway and the bouncers and everything else, his stomach was starting to flip. He no longer knew if it was a good idea to go in there or not. Redirecting his path slightly, he placed a hand over his chest and walked into the alleyway right next to the entrance, trying to calm himself down. Everyone else was already in there, there was no doubt that Nagisa was trying his oh so hardest to get Rei to screw him. Aiichirou stepped around the small area blindly as he tried to locate the wall so that he could lean against it and settle his racing heart. He didn""t understand why he was so nervous; all he had to do was walk in, meet up with everyone else and stick with them! He was sure that Makoto would stay close with him but judging by the fact that the older boy already had to deal with Haruka and his tendencies to dip out whenever he felt like it (and was often found lounging in the community pool which at this time of night could get him into serious trouble),

In spite of what Sandra said, he really couldn""t cooperate, for more than one reason. If he led them to Sam, the young man would definitely prove stubborn and uncooperative and there would be no telling what would happen to him. Alan wouldn""t, no couldn""t, be the cause of that.

As they were still in different countries a few weeks later, they met in the dreamscape. This time Colin""s mind had placed them in an old forest. The actor was sitting on a low log, a small fire burning before him. Merlin could tell he had been mulling over something for a while. It was an expression he saw often in the mirror. He took a seat on an adjacent log. ""What""s on your mind?"" Colin said nothing for a moment, just stared into the flames. ""You""ve read all the scripts, right?"" Merlin said that he had. ""The episode with the Disir. Merlin, well the character, not you, obviously, he tells Arthur that magic is evil. Just on the chance that it would mean Mordred would die."" He fell silent again, but Merlin said nothing. ""I guess I wanted to know if you had ever faced a decision like that. I guess I do not understand how it was a difficult choice. Surely if magic became accepted in Camelot, it would be easier to protect Arthur. And Mordred was still a good knight at this point in the story."" He looked up at Merlin.","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""That, or she""s falling over really slowly."" Dark Star was leaning into something, all right: Luke""s translucent hand. He was concentrating on not putting his hand through her head, but ON her head. It had taken three tries, but now he could sort of do it. Which was why Dark Star was leaning into his hand as he held it there firmly. Then he slipped and his hand went right through her, and she glared up at him. ""Sorry."" Mara frowned. She""d heard a low sort of static of a whisper earlier, and it was back again. Odd... Mara and Leia watched as Dark Star glared at nothing and then leaned into thin air again, and then Mara shrugged and turned to look at Leia. ""So... did Solusar give you a comm link yet?"" She held hers up so Leia could see it. Leia took her eyes off the cat, looked at the small device that Mara was holding up, and shook her head. ""No, not yet... What""s that button on the side for? Comm links don""t usually have that."" ""We found these in a storage locker, and I think the look outs used them when the base was here. The button is an alarm setting. As for why... something happened and I just wanted to be cautious. Better safe and feeling idiotic, than sorry later."" Leia nodded in understanding. ""That makes sense... I""ll ask him for one.""

That tough girl apperance was cracking under pressure. The countless arugements with Beck about Tori. Beck defending her like she was his girlfriend. The way he protects her from anything even Jade""s wrath. If he had a choice to choose between the two girls life, she knew in a heartbeat that he choose Tori""s. She was just that perfect. If anything it would be her and Beck being the perfect couple not her and Beck. Jade was no Tori, she couldnt be. She couldnt show empathy towards others or even sympathize for a mere minute. If anything she has low self-esteem that she likes to hide. Not even make-up could cover the scars she bore on her arms from ""playing"" with her scissors. ""Jade."" Daniel whin. Jade then turn around holding back the urge to break down right in front of him. She refuse to cry, she refuse to scream, she refuse to do anything out of character. Jade was tough.

Look what you got, Jim."" He chuckled in a booming baritone unsuited to his squat frame. His accomplice agreed heartily with him. ""How""d you get her to come way out here? Did you promise her candy if she was a good little girl?"" He guffawed at his own joke, and Sora stiffened at the sound. ""Naw. She was already here all by herself, like she was waiting for someone to come along and collect her."" The first man chuckled, and every hair on Sora""s body stood on end at the pleasant sound, so mutated when escaping from the man""s mouth. Unlike the other two, the one known as Jim didn""t sound drunk at all. By comparison, he sounded chillingly sober, every word and move calculated to evoke fear into her heart and increase the block of ice forming in her gut. Her hazel eyes sparkled with terror as Jim took another threatening step forward. There was nowhere to go, nowhere to run, and the three stalwart characters were obstructing her only escape route. Unless.... Sora hastily cast a surreptitious glance at the fence behind her. It was very high, and quite flimsy, but the mesh might serve as usable hand and footholds. Having little other choice, Sora whipped around whilst the men were still at the other end of the alleyway and began to climb. There was a shout from behind her, followed by the unmistakable sound of running footsteps, and she tried her best to swarm up the steel netting, trusting to the strength borne of her years of soccer training. Her fingers were finding it difficult to get

""Answer me!"" she demanded, voice rising a notch and telltale, dazzling wisps flickering around her clenching and unclenching fists. ""*Answer me*! *ANSWER ME*!"" ""Because you""re my sister."" The shortness of the response took her aback a little, and her concentration faltered just enough for him to fall a few inches, before she recomposed herself and dragged him back up again. Tendrils of her power wrapped themselves around his wrists, securing him further without her having to direct them. ""You""re lying,"" she spat, and mentally tightened the bonds so that they dug into his yielding flesh. Pietro grimaced, but made no other acknowledgment of the move. ""I""m not. For one of the first times in my life, I""m not lying. Wanda, you""re my sister. Whatever you think of me and what I""ve done, you were always that first, to me.""

She tried to get up from her kneeling position and found that her legs too were almost immobilized and it was tiring to try and get up. Had Renji just cast a spell of on her? Was she really awake or had she fallen asleep amidst her musings? ""Now, we can get down to business,"" Renji muttered, inwardly relieved that Tatsuki hadn""t tried breaking the spell by force, as it would""ve caused her destruction and that she didn""t start cursing him into oblivion. She seemed to be in a daze. Probably wondering if she""s in reality or not. There""s going to be a lot to explain later on... ""Howl, Zabimaru!"" As he said the release command, Renji skimmed his hand over the surface of his zanpakutou. Zabimaru glowed red and its form shifted to the fang-like blades. The Allankar eyed the transformed zanpakutou, the annoying smirk still on its face. Apparently, the shikai form of Zabimaru didn""t faze it the least bit. Renji decided that it was just too overconfident of its newfound abilities. When he wanted to protect something, or someone, he went all out to do so. He had almost lost Rukia back then, this time he wasn""t going to lose another person who was beginning to worm her way into his heart. The relatively small room was soon filled with noises of metallic clashes, ripping of cloth and the sickening sound of sharp metal piercing through vulnerable flesh. The high amount of spiritual pressure released was starting to crack the floor tiles and the walls. Even the lamps in the room were beginning to flicker unsteadily in the presence of

All this ""power of love"" thing? Really?"" Dean exclaimed. ""You realize that Cain tried, right? And he failed in the end. I had to kill him to stop him when he decided to exterminate his bloodline."" He was incredulous. Did Chuck, who was God, really believe that Dean would find his equivalent of Cain""s Colette, fall in love, and then have a long and peaceful spell that would hopefully last forever? And it would have to be forever because with the Mark on his arm, Dean wouldn""t have been able to die. Not without worse consequences. That plus the fact that Dean had never really thought about bringing a woman into the hunting life, not since Cassie. Then after his disastrous attempt at finding normalcy with Lisa... yeah, getting a Colette was out of the question for him. ""Cain didn""t have the fortune to meet someone who could stay with him forever."" That was a loaded statement if Dean had ever heard one. If Chuck had really been keeping an eye on things, then this sounded like he""d heard Dean""s conversation with Cas just a day ago. From the sudden hard expression on Chuck""s face, Dean was a hundred percent sure that Chuck knew exactly what went down with Cas. Meaning that Castiel""s dad had seen Cas swearing to stick by Dean for all of eternity, and how did Dean repay that lov- loyalty?

Everyone followed his lead, far happier with the unexpected chore now that there was a reward waiting for them in the morning. It was only a second later that Levi joined the line. He shoved in next to Eren, causing Petra to gawk and Mike to raise an eyebrow. ""Sir..."" she ventured. Petra held out her cloth. ""Are you sure you don""t want to dry?"" Everyone in the squad-minus the newbie-knew that despite Levi""s desire for cleanliness, he despised actually cleaning dishes. Touching the remaining food (even the miniscule bits that were left tonight); the greasy spots where peoples"" hands had touched... it made his skin crawl. Even now he eyed the sink, body unconsciously leaning away it, but he shook his head at Petra. To everyone""s shock he snatched a dish from a still mute Eren. ""Oi. Stupid brat. You""re doing it wrong."" The next morning, Hanji got her pancakes. At the crack of dawn Petra was shoveling shit and Eren was riding hard towards the nearest farm, Gunther once again at his side. Eggs were nearly as hard to come by as meat and Eren doubted that Hanji knew that her beloved breakfast food contained so many rarities-dairy, flour that didn""t resemble a concrete block-but he only needed a little to make a usable batter and Gunther had once saved the farmer""s wife. Rescue from titans bought you a lot these days. They made it back despite the sudden rain and by the time breakfast rolled around that platter was once against stacked, this time with pancakes.

Any more vinegar and my poor enormous cock will become a pickle."" Honeyplace limped back down the corridor. He knocked on Morecombe""s love-nest door. The door creaked open. To a scene that would incriminate Morecombe for more than three human lifelong sentences in prison. Slant was unclothed and balanced rearwards on Morecombe""s tongue. Honeyplace drew back. He knew the law. Sodomy was only allowed cock-in-arse within the walls of Ankh-Morpork. Beyond the walls, cock-near-cock had to suffice in the suburbs that considered themselves above that sort of thing.

By the sound of his tone she could tell he was upset with her. She sat down right there on the floor bowing her head in shame. Robin immediatly felt guilty for making her sad. She didn""t know any better. He kneeled down to her and lifted her chin, looking into her emerald eyes he spoke as soft as a whisper. ""I""m sorry"". He apologized. He hugged her just for a second and let go. Starfire finally smiled after knowing he wasn""t angry with her anymore. She motioned her index finger for him to come closer, so he did. When he did that, she lend in and kissed him on the cheek. A blush creeped was now visible on his face. Which Starfire found it amusing and started to giggle.

Nor did the warble of birds flutter in the air, or the buzz of swamp bugs stir lazily in the gloom. Starlight""s eardrums boomed softly with the sound of quiet. She saw nothing but what lied ahead: a wall of black claws reaching toward her. Once trees, she assumed, but whatever lurked within gnarled them into a defense designed to scare anypony away. Their trunks grew, curving sporadically into whatever shape ensured only one way to enter. Almost mockingly, a black-mud path before her beckoned visitors inside. The woodland""s maw opened wide, the trees themselves curved and their brambles ensnared to form a tunnel. Starlight wore a critical eye as she examined its utterly perfect architecture. She hoped nopony was watching. It there was, she prayed even harder for them to have been fooled by her mask. And ponies call the Everfree unnatural? At least there, the trees grew in their own shape, their own freedom. Whatever force ruled here, it preferred absolute control.

Gamin watched in horror as the group swelled with energy and numbers, then tore himself away to run over to Sunon. She wore an excited grin, leaving him feeling like the only sane man in a cave gone mad. ""Can I talk to you for a second?"" He grabbed her arm to lead her away, but quickly withdrew

Lei Fang loosened her guard and left her arms fall to her hips, a heavy sigh being her first form of response before speaking. ""I doubt it was because of you."" Her eyes flared up at him as she shook her head, turning to Hitomi with a shrug. His arrogance was classic. ""Strange,"" said Gen Fu, driving a thumb and finger down his chin. ""Doesn""t seem like his nature."" Hitomi drove a fist into her open palm as her head was at a tilt. ""We should go after him."" Jann Lee had already taken his leave from the group, not even issuing words over his hasty departure. He was but a few yards away before the rest of him faded into the hazed distance. Hitomi trailed after him. Lei Fang was ready for hot pursuit, but adverted her gaze to Gen Fu and Mei Lin. ""Coming?"" The old master shuddered his eyes to a close with a grunt as he shook his head, hands withdrawn behind him. ""I cannot leave Mei Lin. Consequences would erupt if I were to bring her."" He bowed his head and patted the shoulder of his Granddaughter. ""I have forced myself to believe you can handle this. But remember to work together. Tengu is strong and he will not hesitate to kill you if given the chance."" There was so much to ask him of the knowledge he knew, but now was not the time.

Gone in an instant as it morphed into a bubbly smile as she addressed with a new air of playfulness that almost defined the former police girl, almost. ""I moved them."" Seras stated in a cheerful matter-o-fact way. ""And what compelled you to do such a thing?"" Integra inquired as she crossed her arms over her chest. ""Well I moved them hoping you would leave and go searching for them. You can""t stay cooped up in here forever, wouldn""t want you to age and gain weight now would we."" She stated it so nicely you could have easily have thought you miss heard her, but this was nothing new to Integra. The consistent aging jokes will always be there and probably started around the time she turned 35 and started to ""feel"" her age, or act like an old man as Seras put it. However the fat joke was new and she intended to get to the bottom of it. ""I haven""t gained any weight!"" Integra rose from her chair and ran her hands down the sides of her suit as if to smooth out the material, but in reality she was seeing if she could feel any weight gain. She didn""t feel any different, though not entirely convinced either. ""C""mon Integra"" Seras gestured towards the doors.

Will was thoroughly confused, and even more so when she excitedly grabbed his forearm and ran him down to the docks near the beach, where the water was in view. She took them to a more secluded area, and he felt nothing but confusion and the color appearing in his cheeks. Once she was satisfied with her location discovery, she began walking around on an elevated board, like a balance beam; and Will, sighing with what could have been annoyance, stood under the limited shade offered by a nearby palm tree. ""I hate it there. It""s nothing but terribly uncomfortable clothing, teas and ceremonies, and people so dull and boring it would make you fall asleep just hearing them speak. Not only that, but their noses are so upturned that you""d think they should need to come down for air occasionally. They just walk around like this, thinking their better than anyone else, just because they have nice shoes or a bundle of money,"" She imitated an aristocratic woman by walking with her hands flared out at her sides, taking short, uppity little steps, and sticking her nose dramatically high in the air, which wavered her balance on the wooden beam she had been mounting, landing her square on her rump, and sending her into a small, amused fit of laughter at herself. ""Sounds like you""re describing yourself,"" Will muttered under his breath. ""What did you say?"" Elizabeth inquired, looking concerned.

She preferred to be left alone since most of the time, if anyone knew her well and knew what she was they would be able to eventually see a pattern in her everyday lifestyle.

It wasn""t particularly good for her and some would think that she was in denial about the fact that she said she accepted what she was but it didn""t mean that she had to like it. There was a difference, even an uneducated mind could see that. Maybe it was because she hardly knew any of her kind. She didn""t have anyone to discuss this with other than Ivan.

The sheer height of the mount overwhelmed Jet. He took a deep breath and started up the steep slope. After some time, he reached the top. He collapsed onto the dirt path and gasped for breath. After he regained a sufficient amount of oxygen, he got back up and push past the heavy sheet that covered the door. The tent only had five rooms; the lobby, two rooms for operation, and two rooms where the Elders could reside.

Only a couple other people were around when they walked onto the sand, and they chose a fairly empty spot to lay down their towels. Brennan immediately buried her nose in a journal, and Booth watched her for a few minutes before remarking, ""Let""s go into the water."" Brennan looked up at him. ""It""s winter. I""m sure the water""s freezing."" ""It can""t be that bad. It""s the beach, and the sun""s out."" ""The air temperature is still around sixty."" ""Fine, Bones."" He turned away from her, and she assumed that was his cue that he was finished with the topic. Of course, she should have known better. As soon as her eyes returned to her journal, she felt two strong arms grab her and lift her from the sand. The journal fell from her hands, landing upside down on the sand as she bent her body so that she could punch his torso. ""What are you doing, Booth? Put me down!"" ""I will in a minute,"" he said, carrying her toward the water. As he stepped into the waves, an involuntary shiver traveled up his body from the sudden change in temperature of his feet. ""You""re right, Bones, it is cold,"" he remarked. ""Which is why we shouldn""t go in."" ""I thought you were tough. You mean to tell me you can""t handle a little bit of cold?""

When Scully opened the door, she found the same tall, broad-shouldered man who she had spoken to in the furniture store. ""We brought the beds you asked for tonight as promised, Ms. Scully,"" he said, indicating a truck behind him. ""Thank you. I""ll just show you where they go."" ""That sounds good, Ms. Scully.

Scully asked herself. Of course, there were cases where woman had children even after doctors said they couldn""t. The human body was still something of a mystery. Her Mom would call this a miracle.

Later he saw Arwen again, staring out of an upper window at the night; in the starlight her face was calm, but a deep sadness was revealed as she gazed across the vale towards the falls.

Rachel had quietened a lot - finding her dads corpses the way they were had shaken her more than anyone would have thought possible. Finn had matured in the last few months, taking his position as quarterback and naturally stepping into the role of leader for their shell-shocked group. He still wasn""t exactly the smartest guy around, but he could think in terms of battle strategy, especially when backed up by the rest of them. In the middle of the bus, Kurt had been showing Brittany and Tina how to clean their shotguns. They""d removed several of the seats, and generally remodelled the interior of the bus, so that there was room for them all to sleep or prepare for their battles. Brittany had been given a harsh lesson in the realities of their new life early on, and though she had bounced back with remarkable resilience, everyone knew that she was no longer as naïve as she had once been. As bad as it sounded, the last year had been good for Tina. She was much more self-assured now, and she had been on the front lines since the start. There was a great deal of rage in the small Asian, and she had learned to harness it enough to complete some of the rituals and spells they had required. It might not have been the pure magical energy that the books said was needed - but it worked better for them this way. A little further back, Mercedes smoothed a bandage over Matt""s side. The whole team had been hit pretty hard during the last fight, Matt taking the worst. One of the creatures had taken a

Eventually months passed I had found my feelings that were once focused on the head of the Kuchiki house had completely shifted over to this man I had once barely known and had grown to become acquainted with, so when he asked me to dinner as more then what we were, you could imagine how surprised and excited I had been. Our first date had been quiet but beautiful, a simple picnic in the garden of the fifth division. When I look back on my time with Sosuke there""s always one thing that comes to mind. Every first that we ever shared was at his expense, he was the first one to ask me out, he made the first move, and he said I love you the first time. Never once, had I even thought to say I loved him, but I did, and once he told me he loved me, it hit me fast and hard - which lead me to believe the whole time during our relationship I was under his spell, the power of Kyōka Suigetsu - but... I""d never been exposed to his Zanpakuto before, never once had I seen him in battle and never once did I know what it could do. So how did he deceive me?

Mizuki had worked as Sesshomaru""s secretary the moment she quit her college career- which was a little over five years ago. Never once had she thought anything romantic about the serious business man. Mizuki thought he was quite boring actually; he went to work early in the morning, stayed over time and sometimes stayed all night locked up in his stuffy office of the twenty-fourth floor, glued to his desk doing some sort of paper work, or typing madly away at his computer. The truth is the only time she ever really saw him was when she brought him coffee or his mail. Mizuki went as far as to call him an asshole when she first starting working with him. He had never once acknowledged her when she brought him something other than a grunt or a nod. The first time she even heard him talk... no scratch that the first time she even heard his voice, he was yelling at some employee who ended up being fired on the spot. She was kind of glad he never gave her that much attention after that and she had even cried for the person, she was so scared from the anger being admitted from the man. Mizuki being only nineteen at the time felt rather intimidated and never spoke ill of him again, scared she to would be at the other end of his anger. No Chance, No way! I won""t say it no, no.

The woman collected her composure and began to walk away. ""Thank you."" She spoke quietly, turning back. ""Don""t mention it."" He replied simply. ""Hey lady,"" The Red Hood spoke up after a moment. Jason began digging through his pocket, a second later he found what he was looking for. It was a piece of paper and a pen. He quickly scribbled down a number and passed it to her. ""This is a bad neighborhood. If you ever need help again, give me a call. I know it""s odd, but around these parts it never hurts."" He stated. The woman nodded. It was something Jason hadn""t done in a long time, but given the recent crime wave he figured it would be alright. It wasn""t his real number of course, it was burner. It was something he had done in the past for some of the residents of Crime Alley. Because believe it or not, you can""t always count on the GCPD. There were plenty of corrupt cops, especially ones that dealt with the Alley. Some who would rather make a deal with criminals than actually do their job.

They had just taken down the latest villain that had been terrorizing not only the city, but Barry as well. It had been an exhausting night, both physically and emotionally. Caitlin couldn""t blame Barry for needing to take a minute. However, what was surprising was that somewhere along the way her hiding places had also become his too. When she found him he was sitting on the floor, his head leaned back against the ledge. Caitlin stood in the stairwell and knocked lightly on the doorframe, announcing her presence. Barry""s eyes snapped open and he tensed, but once he caught sight of her, he seemed to relax a little. Caitlin offered him a smile and held up the fast food bag she had been carrying.

They rushed her to the ER with Komamura in a wreck. Unohana calmed him down, but Komamura still worried. He looks into the waiting area, seeing his family and friends there.

He knows Balthazar first tried to hide his scars, even Dean knew about them before he did. He finally confronted him, in the shower of all places. Balthazar first looked at him in surprise, which then turned into a lecherous grin. But he then saw Castiel was looking at his chest, his smile fell and looked nervous.

Iceland wrapped the boy in a simple red cloth; he would have given him something a little more extravagant, but he wasn""t expecting to meet him so he was really quite unprepared. Still, the boy seemed entranced by the crimson surrounding him. ""You like it?"" Iceland asked curiously. In response, the baby let out a soft sigh, almost sounding like an affirmation. Iceland smiled again. He wasn""t sure when the last time was that he had smiled this much. Had it been ever? ""I like the colour red too; it""s on my flag, but blue is still my favourite. I""ll show it to you sometime."" The boy blinked up at him, clearly not having understood a word the older one had just said. Suddenly, his stomach grumbled.

Maybe he""s not used to this kind of food... Wait, what did this kid eat? The boy started to eat some of the dried fish. Well, at least he was actually eating now.

Finally Krystal called for Stefan, ""She wants you to read to her,"" Krystal explained, ""Okay, I left you drink on the kitchen bar,"" Stefan softly, ""Bless you,"" Krystal giving him a kind smile, ""Hey Krystal can you stay with us,"" Kate asked, Krystal turned back, she gave her a small smile, ""Sure,"" Krystal knowing it was one of the last nights she would have with both of them together.

Bobby gladly agreed, handing the key over to Methos. ""Thanks, Adam! G""night!"" ""Good night!"" Nadya returned over her hot chocolate. When the boy had gone, Methos deepened his sprawl and fiddled with his coffee cup. ""You seem to know everyone, just like Duncan."" Nadya commented after a while. Methos shook his head and sniffed lightly. ""I know enough to keep me comfortable."" He gave a shrug, the beginnings of his apathetic mask. ""Don""t have much use for people; too many questions."" His guest pursed her lips and set down her mug. ""Bull! You need people as much as the next person, Methos. Even us Mortals!"" The sidewall suddenly became very interesting as Methos stared a hole through it; relationships were a sore spot for him, even now. ""I am an island, or something like that,"" he muttered. ""No, you""re more of a peninsula because there is a way under your skin."" This statement was made very matter-of-factly, though Nadya had no idea as to why she said it. Silence was the only sound from the other side of the table. Methos didn""t like to admit that there was a way to get to him. First Kronos, then Cassandra, then Alexa; he didn""t have a good track record with relationships and preferred to steer clear of them for now. But Nadya had proven difficult to put off and Methos often found himself opening up to her unexpectedly. Even with his knowledge of her imminent Immortality and the possibility that they may some day have to face each other, he found himself wanting to look at the world the way she

He didn""t know why he felt so comfortable speaking in Russian to her, but it only served to make her that much more special to him. Nadya refused to look at him; it hurt too much. How could she tell him that she just couldn""t do it? That she couldn""t endanger him? Piotr reached out with his other hand and, cupping her chin, turned her face towards him gently. He ran his thumb over the small bruise on her cheekbone. ""Nadya, when he hit you..."" ""No!"" she yelled and pulled out of his arms! ""I won""t let it happen to you! I won""t do it!"" She stood back from him, her arms wrapped around her like a shield. Her eyes were liquidy and red, and her bit her bottom lip, one of her nervous gestures. Piotr""s face was all confusion and pain but she wouldn""t let it touch her. ""Methos has died twice because of me! I won""t let it happen to you! You won""t come back, Piotr."" Just then, her eyes looked beyond him and she quickly turned, hurrying out of the corridor. Going somewhere, anywhere. Piotr looked behind him, tears in his eyes, to see Logan and Talia. They""d heard the noise. Piotr silently retreated in the opposite direction. The Wolverine and the ancient looked at each other before each heading off after their respective comrades.

""While we were out for coffee with Wes and David- Kurt""s friends- I um..."" Blaine started and then trailed off, his courage leaving him. ""Boys, just spit it out."" Burt said, trying for the right balance between firm enough to get them to tell him but not firm enough to scare them. ""We""re dating."" Kurt and Blaine blurted out at the same time and then flushed red. ""What?"" Burt asked, not entirely trusting what he had heard. ""I told Kurt that I had feelings for him and he said that he has feelings for me too...and well, he""s agreed to be my boyfriend."" Blaine replied, trying to get a read on his father but his face was a blank slate. Burt remained silent and the boys sat there anxiously. They didn""t know what to expect but one word and then silence with an unreadable face wasn""t what the had expected. ""Mr. Anderson, please say something."" Kurt said, his voice shaking slightly. He was just starting to realize just how much he had to lose: a family, a home, a boyfriend, an education. ""Well, I can""t say I didn""t see it coming."" Burt said finally.

""Come in."" she said, without looking into his eyes. ""Katie, what""s going on? It""s after one!"" Jim complained, unbuttoning his coat. ""Do you know who""s upstairs?""

Since our rough beginning things hadn""t really gotten much better. But we were on a mutual grunt of acknowledgement basis. I would save his life if it was in desperate measures and I had no doubt he""d do the same for me. I decided to allow this. He finally said something. ""Must you have those damn bells, Mana?!"" He growled at me. I glared at him then decided to avoid an argument. ""Fine,"" I said and began to untie the bells. Without my bells it was silent seeing as they were tucked away between my breasts in my uniform. ""Thank you,"" He choked out in astonishment. ""I just want to avoid an argument,"" I muttered as we trudged on. We began to approach the plant-like building. (AN: That""s nuclear plant or business plant, not stuff like trees or flowers). Then a loud roar broke the silence. A large over-sized hollow literally grew from the sand of the desert around us. I began to unsheathe my Zanpacto but Captain H stopped me. ""We need you later on if anything happens,"" He told me. Rangiku nodded and Byakuya didn""t say a word (as usual) but the rest were shocked. However, no one said a word about it.

She was taller than me at the age of seventeen and was slender with just a touch of curves. She was a Prefect so she had to sit with them. I loved Rosie but we were sisters; we bickered. I frowned and followed her onto the train. She was wearing a traveling cloak along with a pair of jeans and a white blouse that lagged on her with the heavy Prefect badge sewn on. She was magically carrying her trunk behind her whereas I had to carry mine, unfortunately. I rolled my eyes at my sister. She wasn""t lazy; she was just a show-off. I, on the other hand, was wearing a pair of jeans and a grey lace camisole along with my pair of black Adidas. I had my hair let down for once and had let it run cleanly over my shoulders, just barely brushing the tops of my breasts. I found an empty carriage and ducked inside before Rosie could even notice. I reached up and tucked the trunk onto the overhead shelf while I settled my new owl on the patented seat. She was a caramel colored spotted barn owl and fairly beautiful; her name was Cinderella by my choice. I""ve had her for a little over a week and she was already a piece of my heart.

""No fair!"" shouted Duo, patting him on the shoulder before continuing to the bar for a drink. He may not have been 21, but Duo knew the owner, and the owner let him buy beers, because the owner was well aware that steady customers were always a good thing. That, and underage kids were usually the ones that bought the most drinks. ""If Wu gets a practice game, we all do,"" he finished over his shoulder. ""I""ll be damned if I""m paying for a table while you morons chase your balls around!"" he yelled back over the music before turning to the others. ""Who""s this?""

The two robots grabbed Abe roughly and pulled him out of the room. The door was slammed shut and Valentine was left alone once again. Abe could hear her pound the door and scream. She thought he was going to die! Was he? That thought only made Abe panic. Abe was forced down the stairs to the first floor. His ankle was still giving him a lot of grief and he couldn""t help but wince a few times. In the hot room the temperature had taken his mind off his ankle, now the pain was back again.

""Because it""s lonely to be so disconnected from one another, that""s how my people felt. They dreamed of being able to be connected, to be able to visit one another relatively quickly without fear of attacks or taking a long time to reach the destination.

""Mikan-onee-chan can we get some candy? Ugly dummy is really weird. "" I nodded. Then we teleported to my room for some Howalon. I let her down then got a box out as well as some milk candy. ""Thank you."" ""Miku do you want to do something today since it""s a free day?"" ""Can we get Noba-nee-chan and go to central town?"" ""Sure."" And so we were off.

KOKORO STOP READING MY MIND OR I WILL BURN YOU TO A CRISP! I glared at Kokoro who was trying to hide from my sight. Now what to do with the rest of my day... Most of the class had already left after Polka and the little girl left. Then Ruka interrupted my thoughts. ""Natsume, do you want to go to Central Town?""

Then I sat down at a nearby bench and opened the case. Inside was a doll with blonde hair with curls at the end. I picked up the doll to examine it. The doll""s outfit was a light blue long sleeved dress. The bottom of the dress was long and flowing. Crystal flowers were at the waist and were connected to silver chains. There were also flowers at the end of her sleeves, as a hair clip, and strangely one as an eye patch. It was strangely elegant. I""ve never seen something like this. I pulled back her hair to see a key hole.Then I looked back in the case to see a small key and picked it up. It wouldn""t hurt to wind it up would it? Rima""s POV I felt a sudden chill.

695,"Text1: ""Can I get you another one?"" Sarah nodded, grinning. She handed over her empty glass and strained to hear what the crowd across the room was saying. No luck. Way too much noise. Frowning slightly, she eyed the book again. There was no way she""d be able to concentrate on it in this environment. Mentally she calculated the size of the purse she""d lugged along with her. It would fit. That was the nice thing about being an artsy person; you could get away with carrying huge bags around without receiving strange looks. Looking around the room as if one of the partygoers would be suspicious at the book""s mysterious disappearance, she nonchalantly stuffed the leather bound volume into her bag. Spotting the waitress carrying her drink from the bar, Sarah decided to get up and meet her. She should be finding people to talk to, after all. She carefully stowed her bag behind the chair, hiding it slightly, and walked over to the girl. Swiftly paying for the drink, she downed the sweetened liquor and winced as she felt it rise to her brain. It now seemed imperative that she find Kate. Her friend was wrapped in the very center of the throng of people. When Kate spotted her usually reluctant friend, she squealed with joy, and immediately grabbed both of her hands with her own. Both of them were soon moving to the rapidly paced rhythm that saturated the room. Out of the corner of her eye, Sarah spotted her guitar guy and his group of people. They were walking toward the doors of the club. Too bad, Sarah thought. When the colors began to spin a bit even when she was standing still, Sarah realized that it was time to sit again. Laughing now, she dragged Kate

Text2: ""Yeah, we probably should,"" said Fred. He Apparated the two of them to the entrance to Diagon Alley, and they quietly went in. Diagon Alley no longer was a happy place, it hadn""t been since everything had been taken over. Being very careful, they slowly went to the shop and went up to the flat. There were two bedrooms in the flat. One had been the room the twins had shared, and the other had been more of a storage area. George had moved everything to the downstairs storage room to give the couple a room. Soon the two were ready for the wedding night. Angelina awoke with a jerk. This was the first time she had dreamt of their wedding since that night. She leaned back against the pillows, her cheeks wet with tears. Yes, she was very glad that they had gotten married instead of waiting until after the war. She gently placed her hand on her slightly curving stomach. Soon she would look like she was pregnant, something she wasn""t entirely sure about. Not very many people knew that she was married, and she didn""t want to go around advertising it, at least not yet. Pity was the last thing she wanted right now. She just wanted her husband back. Angelina reached up and pulled the chain out of her dress. The two rings, her engagement ring and the wedding ring, sparkled in the moonlight. Angelina gently unclasped the necklace and slipped them off. She carefully placed them on her left ring finger. She was married, and she would wear the rings to prove it. She briefly wondered where Fred""s ring was, then figured that most-likely George knew where it was. It felt strange to have the ring on again after so many months of not wearing","{""output"": ""NO""}"

The walk back was oddly silent so it seemed that they were all more tired then they were letting onto each other. Double D, though, was silent because he had that mysterious figure on his mind. It didn""t look like a meteor but sure enough...it had to have been one, right? They reached their street and turned right onto it but Double D""s house was the first one across, on the corner. ""Good night!"" He smiled and waved to the others. They all waved in response and continued their walk down the dark street, barely illuminated by the street lights, while he entered his house. He immediately saw a new sticky note on the clothes hanger in front of him which read: Went to bed. Remember to shower in the morning! (Heart) Mom. He smiled and walked up the stairs and to his room which was the first door on the right from the top of the stairs. He placed his telescope in the corner by his desk and placed a new label on it, just how like he liked it. He eyed his Astronomy book but decided against opening it to try and get more sleep through the night. That was just too weird...He tried to convince himself but he was set on getting whatever was left of a good night""s sleep. He changed into his read pajamas (with the feet included!) and snuggled in under his covers before flicking his lamp off and dozing asleep to his dream world without boundaries. Down the street as each kid returned home their lights flickered off and the darkness grew. The darkness tonight though wasn""t the typical one. This one was warm and

She glanced at Kevin, who had reloaded his .45 and was shoving ammunition magazines into his pockets. He handsome features were grim, but he showed no sign of fear. Like David, he was fully prepared to do whatever he felt was necessary to keep them safe. Her warriors, she thought as her gaze moved between her best friend, and the man she loved. She was lucky to have them, and she was fully aware of it. She would do her best to help them in this, and not become a liability. She wouldn""t be able to live with herself if anything happened to either of them. David watched Yoko as she glanced back and forth between he and Kevin, and fought the urge to laugh. It would inappropriate, and it might hurt her feelings. Yoko was sensitive that way. She cared for Kevin a great deal, but she loved him. If she was worried that he would be jealous, she was doing it needlessly. He wasn""t the least bit unsure of himself. For good or ill, he knew who was, and exactly what he was capable of. It was more than most people ever discovered about themselves. He grabbed her hand and pulled her towards the bunk, rejoining the other six Raccoon City survivors. ""We""re going to have problems if we try to do this during daylight,"" he stated in a rumble. ""We should hide the guns, wait for nightfall, and make our escape then.""

He bit her shoulders and breasts through the fabric of her clothing. That wasn""t satisfying enough; he tore her dress, exposing her breasts, and bit her nipples. He tasted blood, but didn""t know where it came from. All he felt was the anger within him that made him act like an animal. She bit in his fingers, forcing him to withdraw his hand from her mouth. She managed to shriek again, but to his immense surprise she screamed in ecstasy instead of pain. When he dug his bleeding fingers in the soft flesh of her breasts, she pushed himself more into his touch. She even began to move with him. The sweat dripped from her body and there was an expression of pleasure on her face. His mind lost the last control over his body now the pressure in him became almost unbearable. She helped him change his position, so he could penetrate her from a different angle and bury himself even deeper in her. They groaned in unison. She tightened once more, and seconds later she found her release. Her wetness and the extra friction made him shudder. He pulled out almost completely, and entered her again so hard any other woman would""ve beg for mercy: all what Bella did was moaning in pleasure. It drove him over the edge. A few thrusts more, and he climaxed. It was like his body and mind exploded and would never be the same again. Everything around him faded away, all the feelings of hate he had, and all what remained was the body of Bellatrix beneath him. He collapsed

I don""t want it to stop."" ""It doesn""t have to,"" Mrs. Lovett whispered. As the demon barber was lying so close to her, muttering those words to her, something inside of the woman awakened again.

Like most of my other stories, it""s going to have a lot of action and of course N and Touko moments. Just as a little note Touko is the only name from the Japanese version, everything else uses the English names and such. The reason is because I don""t like the name Hilda for the main character. XD So yeah. Enjoy the story! ""Okay Cubchoo! Use icy wind!"" cried Touko. The small bear-like Pokemon inhaled a deep breath before opening his mouth and releasing the ice-type attack against the Zebstrika it was facing. Without even thinking the electric-type horse dodged to the left before charging at the Cubchoo with a flame charge attack. Cubchoo""s eyes widen and he covered his eyes with his hands as the huge Pokemon charged towards it covered in flames. Touko, knowing this could get bad spoke up, ""That""s enough Zebstrika."" ""Zebstrika!"" cried the zebra-like Pokemon before the flames around him vanished and he walked over to Touko and the Cubchoo in a slow walk. He gently butted the Cubchoo with his head in a gesture to ask if the young Pokemon was alright. In response the bear made a happy noise and hugged the Zebstrika""s head. Touko sighed and put her hands on her hips. She had been at it for days and still Cubchoo would have trouble dealing with attacks coming straight at it. ""Touko!"" Turning to the voice Touko said happily, ""Mom!"" Touko""s mother chuckled as she held up a basket. ""I brought lunch."" ""That""s great!"" Touko said happily.

""Only unlike Cherrykit, I have had my full training. I have more powers than she does. I know more. And I can help you."" Cinderheart turned away.

That sounded like a good plan to him. ""Will you be ok?"" Bruce asked. Roy nodded again. ""Is Dick asleep"", he asked in a dull, empty voice.

She glanced back at him for a moment; it was a snapshot she knew she""d see with painful clarity when trying to sleep the next time the opportunity came around. He simply twisted and lifted the bow, jamming it between his leg and the wooden stanchion. He gave a grunt of pain as he rammed it down. It bounced off the wooden shaft pinning his leg to the structural support. He hammered at it again and again; each time it ricocheted off as if daring him to slam the end of the bow into his own foot. ""Goddamn-"" ""Stop,"" she said. She backed away from the window, retreating until she was level with him. She crouched, her eyes still on the window, as her right hand went out and touched at the shaft behind him. ""What is this?""

I step up to the tomb and torches all of a sudden burst into flames all around the room. I look around the room and see a continuous mural painted onto the walls depicting a warrior in black armor. At the end of the mural the warrior has his armor off and is standing beside Salazar Slytherin of all people. I feel a pull to look at the warrior""s face and walk over to do just that. My heart stutters as my breath catches in my throat at seeing beautiful crimson eyes. ""Why do his eyes make me feel safe while Voldemort""s make me feel terror?'

704,"Text1: [Ddraig]{Albion} talking openly Chapter 2 Sun streamed through cracks in the curtains of an unknown room, in an unknown area. It was a bedroom, to be exact. In the bed, a head was sticking out of the cover. It was a boy. Almost a man, really. He had shoulder length brown hair, tied in a ponytail at the back. He had a streak on scarlet going through his hair, looking like a gash on his head, pronouncing the rest of his hair excellently. From the length of the bed, we could see he was roughly six foot one. Despite being only seventeen, he had an old face, looking more like a man. Not old, but older. He was also extremely handsome. When the sun rotated around to his bed eventually, as it shone into his eyes, causing a flutter on his eye lids, and he opened them. The sun moved away slowly, continuing its sweep of the room, his eyes were then seen. Deep and chocolate coloured. Issei, the teen, slowly felt life creep back into his body as he woke up. Checking his alarm clock, he realised that he had school today, and he let loose a deep, frustrated groan. First day of school in a town he hasn""t been to since his Dad died. As he tried to rise from his bed, he felt a weight on his chest. Having a rough - no, clear - idea of what it was, he lifted the covers. To normal people, they would have been freaked out, and even out right excited at a girl in their bed that wasn""t there last night, but Issei was just annoyed. ""Ugh,"" He groaned, ""Vali, wake up. You""re in my bed again."" The now introduced Vali started to stir, moving around on Issei""s chest.

Without an activity that would require the entire team in attendance, the teenagers tended to go their own ways. But this didn""t mean that Damian was offended; the team separating was actually the perfect chance for Damian to hunt down the clone and speak with him - alone. He found the clone in the lounge area, intently watching a channel tuned to static. Damian scowled at the irritating buzz and quickly crossed the room to turn off the television set. ""Hey!"" He ignored the protest and turned to face the enraged clone. ""You are the one they call Superboy,"" he stated. ""What""s it to you?"" Superboy glared. ""I would make a deal with you.""

He did have certain... urges. Ever since he was a teenager. But he never acted upon them. He never had sex, he never masturbated. Whenever he would feel an urge to do so, he would remind himself what dirty and messy result would acting upon those urges have and soon, those urges would disappear. But now... it was different. It was eleven pm and he had no new projects to work on. Thinking about his older projects would only remind him on what Leslie did with his equations, resulting in more and more frustration. And he recently got another problem... the one that was tenting his pajama bottoms. He simply couldn""t get the mental images of Leslie""s naked body reveling in pleasure out of his mind. Feeling of arousal was evident, but what was bothering him more were feelings of confusion and frustration. He sighed and glared at his alarm clock. It was almost twelve pm.

She also has multiple stabbing wounds on the chest and stomach area. There was blood everywhere: on the pillows, walls, ceiling. She wears nothing but a white T-shirt and blue lance panties. Bed sheet is ripped off her, laying on the floor. Sid walks over to the bed amd photographs the body from four different angles.

Logan leaned his head back onto the Mansion wall as he thought over the past two years. Logan and Creed had had met Gambit while looking for Star and had become friends. They exchanged their memories about Star and Gambit told Logan and Creed that he was in love with her, this caused a bit of tension between Logan and Gambit however they finally decided that since they both loved her and wanted her to be happy, whenever they found her that is, that they would be okay even if Star picked the other one. Creed was simply happy to finally have his real memories back and to him Gambit was like another little brother. Everyone at the Mansion had been extremely wiry of Creed when Logan had first brought him in but now he was one of the X-men although he refused point-blank to even touch one of their leather suits. The Professor still tried to find Star through Cerebro however he hadn""t even heard a whisper of a thought from her but he still looked once a week every week.

Since no one had any idea where Osiris currently was no time had been wasted when gathering the necessary information and deciding on a proper course of action. This meant that they had to work fast and not wonder why SG1 was late in checking in. Luckily that worry had been assuaged right before they headed out. It appeared that the typical luck of any combined mission with SG1 was holding true. Even for the rest of SG1. Okay, enough. Focus. First priority was getting a hold of those documents Ri""ku had mentioned. Which was why Morrow was laying motionless in the dirt surrounded by jaffa still loyal to Osiris. They needed to have leverage before Osiris showed up. If she does. We don""t really know how important anything here actually is. Not to mention we don""t have a clue what she actually is planning.

He glanced briefly at his watch, confirming that he should be able to get into position in time. The timing for his part was critical. At least Kintu knows the lay of the land. And he admitted to himself at the very least we will end up with some valuable Intel. He shook off any more doubts. He could worry about the slim chance of success of the greater mission later. Right now he had a very important task to complete. Sometimes I really hate being the one in charge. Major Griff bemoaned in his head. After all, it was

The only differences were the color of the overmantle, mask, and shin-guards he wore, which were yellow rather than blue. The eyes too, were different. They were white. No pupils denoted color. No life, no sign of emotion was visible in them, save one. Rage. For he was dead, this one. Had been dead ever since that night almost a year ago, when he had embarked on that mission to the Shaolin temples in order to acquire a map. A simple mission it had seemed, but he had no way of knowing that it would be his last. For another had been sent on the same mission, this one from the rival clan of the Lin Kuei, hated enemies of his own Shirai Ryu. He also had no way of knowing that they had been sent by the exact same individual, for his own sinister purposes. He did not know then, and he did not know now. There was much he did not know, in fact. These were not things he remembered, they were simply facts. For after the other had ended his life that night, and he had been remade by the dark forces of another world, nearly everything had been erased from his memory. Well, almost all. He remembered who killed him, and in that dark place, it had been revealed to him that not only was he dead, but that other and his ilk had also gone about exterminating his family, and his clan.

The Decepticons onboard Astrotrain stared at Starscream, in utter disbelief at what he""d just done yet expecting no more of him. It had been inevitable, really, Soundwave thought - he had been vying for this position for so long, what seemed like eons, now. Ever since he had first joined the Decepticons, he had questioned Megatron""s every decision, pointed out his tiniest weaknesses. He had even attempted to assassinate him, on more than one occasion. The mystery was, why did Megatron tolerate it? It went beyond insubordination, beyond treason - it was blatantly and obviously raw ambition. Although he had been confined to solitary imprisonment once or twice, and on one memorable occasion, had been discharged from the Decepticons entirely, marooned on an island on the planet Earth, many a Decepticon had been punished far worse, for far less. Perhaps the answer was that, sad as it was, Megatron needed him around. Although many of the higher-ranking Decepticons were not privy to this information, Soundwave had been present at the many meetings where Megatron had conferred with his lieutenants, planning this or that raid, drawing whichever blueprint, deciding which resource to plunder. Millions of years back, on Cybertron, on Earth, and back on their home planet again, as they had proceeded to wrench it entirely from the hands of the Autobots, and all but win the war. No sole Decepticon could claim to have been the driving force in the conquest - it had been the greatest of team efforts, Starscream too contributing a great deal, plotting out many of the air strikes against the major Autobot strongholds.

The knock on the door had Rory on her feet in seconds as Paris and Janet continued to argue, ignoring that there was someone at the door.

Rory didn""t know what to think as she immediately ushered Louise into the dorm. ""What happened?"" Rory asked, as soon as the door was closed and Louise completely inside. Paris stopped bickering with Janet long enough to notice that her oldest friend looked unlike she had ever seen her before.

In an almost animalistic state, Rotom reveal itself in a form of chuckles and sinister giggles before he reappear again a distant away from the Sun Pokémon. Rotom is so stress out that he is willing to reappear before it got close to Espeon just to execute Sucker Punch. This allows the calmer Espeon who is holding a ball of pure raw energy to turn towards Rotom fast approaching form and mercilessly fire Hyper Beam at it.

""Any idea what it was?,"" Beckett urged him to continue. ""No, but when we had our breakfast, she seemed in a hurry,"" Adam said, ""Like she had to be somewhere and she was trying to get rid of me. I didn""t think anything of it at the time. I just thought she had an appointment with the baker or the florist or another detail for our wedding before she had to go to work."" ""Do you have any idea where she went after she had breakfast with you?,"" Castle asked, hands clasped, as he leaned toward Adam. ""I figured she just went to work or to an appointment with someone for our wedding,"" Adam said again. ""You don""t seem to know a whole lot about the details for your own wedding,"" Castle observed and Beckett gave him a look. ""That""s because Anna didn""t want me to,"" Adam gave a small smile, tears starting to form in his eyes, ""She wanted to plan it all herself, she wanted her dream wedding and told me that I shouldn""t have to worry about anything...""

And she felt even worse every time they kissed for with each one she fell deeper into his spell. Even now the moonlight cast its silvery light upon him, providing an image that burned itself into her memory for keeping, and she fought against the traitorous emotions that rose within her. Legolas saw the warring emotions that played upon her features and knew she fought with herself over what had happened this evening just as he had his own misgivings about it. He had often wondered why he was torturing himself like this when he knew that it was very likely that the one she loved would return to her, and who wouldn""t? But then all his thoughts vanished when he looked into her eyes, and he knew that he would do anything for her, even if it meant letting her go if she chose to be with another. She fascinated him as no other had during his long years, a fact which drew him ever closer to her as he wished to know everything about her. Shaking off his wandering thoughts, he rested his hand on her arm and leaned close to kiss her cheek. ""I thank you for sharing this evening with me, my lady."" A slow smile appeared as she was grateful that he had sensed her emotions and had chosen not to make things any more complicated than they already were, although a small part of her was disappointed that he had kissed her so formally. ""I thank you also, my lord."" He found himself gazing at her mouth,","{""output"": ""NO""}"

He manifests lightning with his hands but waits just long enough to be able to tell himself that, when he does throw it across the arena, it""s in self-defense. Cole""s attacks move slower, but they look like they would really hurt if he got hit the wrong way.

He goes flying, lands, and skids along the ground for a few feet before he finally stops.

Now I could see enormous black hellhounds prowling around the edges of the room, and the skeletons that had laid in piles on the floor the last time I""d seen them were now whole and standing at attention amidst the cracked and ruined thrones.

Killian looks over at an individual in front of a large van, he has several large boxes in front of it. Killian stops and cautiously approaches the man. He can""t make out the man""s face as it is shadowed due to the nearby streetlight and he had his hood up. The guy is struggling to pick up the large boxes and put them in the back. Killian was suspicious of what a guy was doing, loading his van in the middle of the night, but he figured the faster he helped, the faster he could get back to his ship. ""Just grab one end,"" the guy says, pointing to end closest to the pirate. Killian leans down and both of them lift the box into the van. They repeat the procedure until all the boxes are loaded and the owner of the van slams the door shut. ""Thanks so much,"" the guy says. He pulls his sliding side door open","{""output"": ""NO""}"
723,"Text1: Danny took his arms out of the sleeves of his hoodie, and then his head. As he tugged the hoodie off, his book tower clattered to the floor in seemingly slow motion, with a sound that seemed louder than any ghostly wail. The teacher turned towards Danny. Every student in the room moved their heads in the direction of the sound. ""Oops."" The ghost boy whispered. He put his hands behind his head and rested his elbows on the cluttered desk in a failed attempt to hide his bright white hair, his anxiousness only making his eyes grow unnaturally brighter. He bit his lip and picked up his books, one by one, from the floor. ""I""ve made a terrible mistake.' He thought, focusing on the chipped desk. If anyone didn""t realise it was him then, they definitely would now. Because Danny fell through his desk. The (Mass) Realisation What could be worse than phasing through your desk in front of the people you know? Phasing through the roof of the classroom below that desk in front of strangers, of course. Danny surveyed the classroom he phased into. This classroom was full of other freshmen, though he hadn""t met them before. ""Uh, sorry, just passing through."" Apologised Danny through gritted teeth. And through the ceiling. And the floor of his classroom. And through his desk. If this was a ""normal"" day at school, a few students would""ve laughed, maybe chucked some paper at him, but that would be all. Unfortunately for Danny, today was not normal. Today was his first day back as a ghost, so naturally, like most people do when they see a well-known superhero use their powers, cheers erupted and the classroom became a... well, anything but a classroom. Desks were flipped, students ran down the halls, and

Rin, who was sitting on the other side of Naraku, was moving around the food on her plate, rearranging them into random patterns. Naraku looked at her, eyebrow raised. In a falsely sweet voice he began, ""Rin dear! Why don""t you eat your food, hm?"" He smiled and tapped her hand with his fork which was meant to be a slap, though it looked like a friendly little pat to everyone else. If one listened closely enough to Rin, they""d hear her chanting the mantra ""Remember Rin, you are adopted, you are adopted. You have no connection to this family. No connection."" Kagura, her older sister who sat beside Rin, was stealing glances at her, almost as if she were trying to burn her with her ruby eyes. Damn her! The only reason she""s sitting there is because she""s not married! Thanks to the fat lot of help this ""family"" provided, I""m married to this stupid Kouga freak. He""s a barbarian! Now she decided to send her glare in waves towards Kouga who sat beside her, unaware of her anger. ""Thanks to you, I""m not the one who gets to sit across from Lord Sesshoumaru!"" She hissed. Kouga merely grunted and replied with something that sounded like a ""You can barely see him from this distance!"" Kagura huffed and returned to her dinner. Rin smiled smugly to herself. At least one good thing came out of this night. It was about two in the morning when Kagome collapsed on her bed. The cleanup had taken longer than she expected, so it was a relief to be back in her room. Not even the abnormally cold atmosphere that seemed to settle in only her room","{""output"": ""NO""}"

""Do you believe in love at first sight?"" Kira asked. ""No,"" Renji answered quickly. ""Do you?"" Kira remembered that smile as the two of them talked to one another. He remembered the way that Hisagi Shuuhei had made him feel. The sensations were taking him over until nothing remained. That moment was carved into him like Hisagi was a knife. He closed his eyes as the memory faded. ""No,"" Kira whispered, barely audible. ""Of course not..."" I""m sorry that it""s taking me so long to update.

But all matters have been discussed within the Order on what we should do, and I think it""s best to leave it up to us."" Hermione scoffed at him. He was treating her as if she was a child! ""I am not a child! I am perfectly capable of leading my ideas inside the Order as well as you do. Don""t pretend you don""t know that Harry, Ron and I are more than willing to fight."" She stared at him with hard, cold eyes, as if trying to hit him with her lethal look. He knew she was right. How could he not notice her and her abilities? But she was too young. Her life was not worth giving up for this, unlike him, who had lived long and was ready to die. He suddenly had the huge urge to protect her. ""You""re right.

Before you go and decide to fight a war that hasn""t even started."" ""I already have, and I""m staying by Harry""s side till the end."" Hermione said this with no hesitation and pure dedication. He could only feel a swell in his heart, seeing how loyal she was. Just like Lily. She""s not Lily, and you""re not 15. Stop dreaming, he told himself.

He remembered when everything was simple, and Jacqueline was younger and didn""t worry about protests, or crime, or death. She was innocent and pure. She knew the horrors of Paris. Javert was so unbelievably proud of the beautiful young woman she""d grown to be, but he seriously worried if she would do something that would put pain in both their lives. Jacqueline didn""t respond, she wiped the tears away from her eyes. She sat back down on her bed. ""I just-"" Javert lowered his voice from yelling to soft, ""I just don""t know what would happen if I lost you. I don""t know what I would do."" Jacqueline looked up at her guardian with red-rimmed hazel eyes, glassed over and vulnerable. Javert reached his hand out to her, doubting she would take it. Just as he did the night they met, when she was trembling, alone, under the bassinet. She blinked up at him, her lashes thick and wet from the tears. She sniffled quietly and put her small hand in his, and stood. She caught Javert off-guard when she quickly hugged him. She wrapped her arms around the man that had raised her, held her, comforted her, and kissed her when she cried. Javert sighed, putting his chin on her head. Jacqueline hated fighting with him. Not only was it hard to yell at those gentle, kind eyes, but she couldn""t ever keep up a fight with Javert. He was too relentless, too calm, and would always seem to win the argument.

However, he knows that there are those who would attempt to kause you harm, and he has no wish for anything to befall a friend he remembers with the warmest memories."" The tension of the room lessens somewhat, simply because the captain has assured us that Palandir will not force us into an early agreement. I catch Xylander""s eye, and give him a slight nod. Turning back to the man before me, I speak again. ""I, too, remember my old friend with warm thoughts. I am honored that he still thinks of me, and worries about my well being. I do not deserve such a gift. Tell me, sir, what is your name?"" He straightens up a bit, serious expression on his face. He then gives me the common salute of all the Earthbound countries, voice clear and strong. ""My name is Mryth, my Lady. Kaptain Mryth of the Magliss guard. We are at your kommand.""

""All I know is that, I""m trapped in this marriage, and I love you, and I detest Liu Bei with every fiber of my being, and I--"" Gan Ning cut her off and wrapped his arms around her in the darkness. He leaned closer to her and gave her a kiss. Shang Xiang stopped her tirade, raised her arms and embraced him as well. She moved her hands to his short brown hair, spiked up as usual, and ran her hands through it. It was amazing; just hugging him was enough to make her feel as though all the pain she had felt had been lifted. ""Isn""t there some way we could just run away from it all and be together?""

Instead, she stretched out her hands, and the spiders all ran back towards her, clambering up her legs and running up her clothes to nestle in her hair. She hugged herself tightly, and her spiders rested on her arms, making it look like she was hugging them. The people in the street stared at her, their faces twisted into various expressions - shock, disgust...fear. ""Hiragana..."" She heard someone mutter, and some of the stares turned to distrustful. Hitomi clenched her jaw and began to walk, fixing her eyes on the road, refusing to show her hurt. She would not run. It was hard to believe that just seconds ago she had been embroiled in a playful battle with one of her team mates. Said team mate was still firmly cocooned, and she felt his stare on her back, burning her as she walked away, only breaking into a run once she was past the glares and accusing fingers being pointed at her.

It hurt more than she would ever let on. Of all the reactions, the young girl""s hurt Hitomi the most. What was the child afraid of? She had asked Akihiro why people were scared of spiders, and he had told her that sometimes it was because of the way they moved - so fast, and with so many legs, or because of the way they looked - creepy, apparently.

Kid Flash could see she was deeply upset. He took her arm and guided her out of the ruined store and into open air where she collapsed against him.

Everyone was personable in their own way and equally likeable, thus far-save Spock and Uhura. Then there was HIM. Kirk was a bundle of energy, always curious and nosey, almost like a hyper teenager. He was witty and sly and very mischievous. He was equally endearing and obnoxious. He definitely thought he was a sex god, and that was a turn off, though in my deepest, darkest mind I found it a turn on-maybe I should""ve gone into psychiatry after all. While the womanizing of the other Kirk was more like a fall back maneuver in tight situations, this Kirk just flirted for the joy of flirting, and seduced for the joy of sex-well it was a coping mechanism also. This Kirk was younger, had a stronger libido, so I suppose that accounts for that. He used his charm to maneuver in ways the other Kirk didn""t have to. That was probably because the other Kirk had been older and had more of a reputation. This one was still green, minus the epic battle he""d just pulled through against that psycho Romulan. This Kirk had moments where I could see an exact replica of the Kirk I""d known and it made my heart ache to be around him.

Now, don""t be confused, Will was cute to begin with, sweet and an all around great guy, but he had changed more than just about anyone in his time since high school. Will had finally hit a growth spurt his junior year, growing nearly four inches and becoming a decent six foot one. His jaw got broader like his dad""s, his shoulders wider and with constant crime fighting, his build grew too. Will was as wide as a door almost, buffer than a linebacker and a hundred times stronger than an ox.

""If I Only Had a Father"" Three years had passed since the fateful visit to Besaid to celebrate Vidina""s thirteenth birthday. Nedia had grown into a beautiful young woman, much like her mother. Like her mother she was a quiet girl, never talking much but always having lots on her mind. Nedia tried talking to her mother about her late father, her real father. But Yuna would change the subject, or answer vaguely, and so now Nedia didn""t even bother to ask. She didn""t see what there was to hide. She knew that Seymour wasn""t her real dad, that was obvious. ""But why would Mom hide my real dad from me?' Nedia would ask herself over and over. ""Was it not supposed to happen? Am I...?' She shook her head. ""No, it""s true. If it was, then they""d abandoned me.' It wasn""t a very comforting thought, but it made sense. So, despite the possible bleak outlook, it gave her a shred of comfort, enough to satisfy until she really could find out. Nedia rolled over in her bed. She looked out the window and saw the light shining through. She squinted and then covered her eyes. ""Didn""t I close the curtains last night?' Too tired to really do anything about it, she just rolled back over and covered her head with her covers. About an hour later she was up and dressed. She went to her mirror

""Are you going to swim with Ambyr and I?"" ""Yes."" He crossed over to where she was, and kissed her. ""I""ll meet you outside."" He knew that if he saw her naked all thoughts of swimming would be forgotten and the fact that they had company be damned. When Avalena and Ambyr rejoined him out on the deck he saw that Ambyr had dressed in a sleek little purple bikini. Where Avalena had dressed in a dark red one piece that was low cut in the back, the front cupped and lifted her breast and showed off her cleavage to an advantage. He licked his lips in appreciation. He saw the pile of towels sitting on the deck and knew that Avalena had grabbed them so water wouldn""t be tracked into the house. Victor glanced up from what he was doing and saw what Ambyr was wearing ""You are not wearing that. It shows way to much skin."" Ambyr""s response was thumbing her nose at him and stepping over the railing and taking off for the beach. ""Ambyr!"" he yelled after her quickly retreating back. ""What about me? Am I showing to much skin?"" Squall asked sarcastically. He put one hand behind his head, placed the other hand on his hip and took the classic supermodel pose. ""And me. What about me Victor?""

Holiday Blues Chapter 9: Tumbling Down ""Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why did I pick this stupid movie!"" Anzu was sitting on her couch with a half gallon of double chocolate ice cream in her lap, repeatedly clubbing herself in the forehead with the TV remote. Her hair flew wildly around her face. I should have picked a sports movie, or something with slimy aliens. But no, I had to go and watch...this. She""d learned about the therapeutic powers of ""Pride and Prejudice"" from a fellow dance student in New York. The six part BBC miniseries version of Jane Austen""s novel was widely appreciated as surefire blissful distraction from a broken or otherwise damaged heart. Anzu had utilized its mesmerizing powers a few times in the past, and thought it might be worth auditioning as an effective way to cure her Kaiba fixation. But, apparently, the distractive powers of ""Pride and Prejudice"" didn""t work so well when the object of your affection had so many Mr. Darcy-esque qualities. Anzu felt like a complete idiot. She was trying to put the infuriating Seto Kaiba out of her mind... so she had chosen to watch a movie where the romantic lead is filthy rich, handsome, lacking in the social niceties department, and prone to protective and affectionate behavior toward a younger sibling! I must be on crack, she reasoned. Turning off the TV and VCR, Anzu pushed the hair out of her eyes and headed to the kitchen to put the ice cream back in the freezer before it melted all over her favorite black satin pyjama pants. Closing the freezer door, she idly wondered

""I""m gonna go see what""s keeping Brick."" Jessie stood up and was about to leave, but Scott stopped her. ""Wait,"" Scott said, ""Help me?"" Jessie grinned, ""Per your request."" she said happily, making her way towards Scott""s bedroom. By the time the two were finished, Scott had on some fairly new Levis, a clean shirt, and had gelled his hair back. Jessie had made Scott shave off what little hair he had on his upper lip. ""Scott,"" she""d said, ""Boys- as well as girls -hate kissing boys with facial hair, especially when they can""t grow facial hair!"" Scott had turned bright red. She wasn""t wrong, after all.

Jessie practically had to drag Scott to Brick""s apartment. He must be nervous, she decided as she rang the doorbell once more.

How could Ryan explain to her that it was something that was out of his control? He couldn""t immediately turn his feelings for Greenlee off - she was his rock. Kendall was his weakness, his downfall. The person who more than anything he wanted to rip out of his heart, yet he found that every time he tried, he couldn""t. But this time, this one time it was easy. It was simple. He knew that he wanted to keep Greenlee. Kendall saw Ryan once again deep in thought. ""Go Ryan. Think about this. You did come back to me tonight. I will wait until tomorrow for you. I know you will make the right choice. You will choose me over Greenlee - because I do truly love you."" Ryan headed for the door, not having to hear Kendall say it twice. He wanted out of there as fast as he could and before she would change her mind. Ryan looked at Kendall one last time and walked out the door. That had not gone as expected. He believed that he would start a new life with Kendall but now, now he did not know. He was at a crossroads: Greenlee or Kendall. What was he going to do? Ryan came out of the elevator at the same time as Greenlee made her way to the door. They both put their hands on the doorknob and Greenlee had to step back as Ryan pulled the

Of course his perfection was everything she wanted, everything she needed but did she want it from him? For so long she had been alone, pining over Derrick, doing everything in her power to forget him and suddenly...enter Finn. He was so wonderful but her heart did not belong to him completely and she did not even know if it would ever be his. In spite of what happened tonight and how much she had missed being with Derrick and making love to him, could she just turn her back on Finn and at a chance at real happiness? What about Derrick though? Would she be so prideful as to not give him a chance to explain why he did the things he did and how he hurt her? Could she be that spiteful to him just because she had cried herself to sleep night after night for weeks while he had gone home to his wife? They were both looking at her expectantly. They had glanced at each other just seconds before and Finn with his innocent look and his naïve outlook on the tumultuous relationship that she shared with Derrick truly expected her to leave with him. On closer inspection, however, she saw, as he understood the heavy tension that was emanating from her and Derrick. It was so noticeable that you could cut the tension with a knife. His face changed immediately as understanding started to hit him. What was she going to do? In her life nothing had come easy for her and this was just another example of her being taunted by fate, destiny, whatever you chose to call it. In one hand she had a chance","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Shane laughed, and then scooped her up into a quick hug. ""Want ta come over to my place? We could play ""The World"","" Shane offered. ""Alright, lemme just grab my coat,"" she said, and then Shane said something strange. ""Are you alright Sharie?"" he asked in a voice not his, ""What?"" Crystal asked, confused. ""I asked if you were alright,"" The incorrect voice came again, and she was snapped back to cold reality. PRESENT ""Are you alright?"" the voice asked again, and Sharie nodded.

While the things in front of her struggled to find a way around the foot high barrier in their path, Ericka grabbed a handful of shells for the shotgun. It took her a few seconds but she figured out how to reload the weapon. She was back on her feet with the shotgun in her hands the same time that the five remaining of the arcade staff started towards her again. I only put four shells in, so I need to slow them down after the fourth so I can reload... This seemed simple enough. So why did she feel so damn nervous? Ericka pulled the trigger of the shotgun. The head of the one with the axe was gone in a few seconds. It fell to the ground. Then it stood up. It started to feel around blindly for her. Ericka pulled the trigger three more times and watched the results. Another body joined the first on the floor and another of the staff had a rather large hole in his chest. Ericka scooped up the remaining ammo on the floor and shoved it into the shotgun. That was only three shots worth. She""d managed to get a third down before having to reload. For once she had time to shove as many shells in the shotgun as would fit, which was only six. Once this round of shots was fired, all of the bodies were on the ground. Ericka sighed with relief. They were still twitching a little, but it wasn""t anything she thought she had to be worried about. Ericka knelt down near the chainsaw for a second.

He pulled on the heavy hooded robes that he refused to think of as maternity wear, whatever the Headmaster may have quipped. Long, deep cuffed sleeves draped over his puffy fingers, falling almost to his aching feet. Perhaps the worst possible garb for a potions laboratory - but at least the heavy hem covered the quilted slippers he was forced to wear. Not that he was getting in to his lab. Not without at least one Imperious - and possibly a few Kadavra""s - aimed at that damn Weasley the Headmaster had hired as his ""teaching assistant"".

There was something gentle yet pleased around his eyes. ""He knows this? That they might feel this way?"" ""Yes."" Distance from the Host would not have weakened Gabriel""s memory. ""It causes him pain, I think, although he denies it."" Gabriel would mock the idea that he still wants Heavens approbation, but watching Dean has taught Castiel how often mockery can cover bleeding needs. The similarity between the two souls is in this way painful to consider, and at times Castiel fears that Gabriel in heaven had suffered as deeply as Dean had in hell.

""He knew there would be consequences, but he helped you anyway."" The minister sounds strangely upbeat. ""Willingly. You didn""t force him to help you, right?"" "" I begged him but... no.""

He is much stronger than I ever was."" ""Well then."" The man nodded, as if some great conclusion had been reached. You have to respect your brother, and allow him to make his own moral choices.""

He was perfectly healthy, according to Lazer""s senses, but the teenage fox had a thousand-yard stare only war veterans should have. Sonic opened his mouth but Tails interrupted: ""You were missing for seventeen days,"" he said, his voice hollow and mechanical. Lazer reeled at this. Even Deomorg was taken aback and halted his attack. Space and time are, by themselves, immense; anyone who lives in the third dimension will attest to this. These warriors, however, had not merely passed through the third dimension like a rock skipping across a river, but had tumbled through multiple dimensions. Their journey had been like a rock skipping across a river that was simultaneously dry in Summer heat, frozen in Winter chill and flooded in Spring rains. They were both lucky they hadn""t been gone seventeen millennia - by then, everyone Lazer knew would have been long dead, and Deomorg would have been faced with a planet that had thousands of years to prepare countermeasures to his dark magic. Nothing less than a miracle had brought them back so soon from their interdimensional jaunt. The red hedgehog groaned, smacking a paw against his forehead. ""Rebecca?"" ""Hasn""t had the baby yet!""

It was her goggles. She was standing in Titan""s Tower in her uniform. She looked at the open hole in the floor. In the T-Car- ""What is that!"", Cyborg continued. Robin looked out and saw a tiny yellow speck falling from the tower. Robin surmised that it was out of the range of Cyborg""s mechanical eye if he was asking.

Two days were not very long by any stretch of the imagination - unless you were a butterfly with a lifespan of three days - but it was certainly enough time for him to realize that he needed to go back, despite any reservations he might have had. He needed that odd peace of mind that he got when he lay next to Inuyasha""s older brother, that odd peace of mind that was paradoxically the cause of all his anxieties. And yet, despite that need, it took him a very long time to accept the fact that he was willing to remain in purgatory for the rest of his life. !-! They rarely kissed, and if they did, it was never on the mouth. So when Sesshoumaru brushed those cold lips against his, he passed it off as an accident and never deigned to think about it again. !-! Somebody had once told him that if you hit rock bottom, then the only place you could go from there was up. He swore that he would hunt down that person, rip off his lips, and force-feed it to him while smiling like a crazy person. Because he was a crazy person, and it was only natural for a crazy person to act like... well, a crazy person. He didn""t care if that made no sense. It wasn""t exactly the time to be worrying about that. What he should be worrying about, especially in the immediate future, was the stare that Inuyasha was giving him. It was the kind of stare where the eyeballs looked about ready to fall out in disbelief-slash-petrifying horror, and he had a feeling that if he didn""t say something soon, he would have

Never mind that he was wearing leather again, instead of the pinstriped suit that was the favorite of this regeneration. Never mind the haunted look in his eyes; self-centeredly I may have put that down to him missing me. It was the same voice, same face, same body walking back to the TARDIS, so I never took the chance to take a second look.

Will opened his mouth to thank him when he shifted his hand and coins began to rattle. He paused. ""This isn""t the nest."" he croaked. ""No, you began to walk in your sleep."" Hannibal confirmed. He tilted his head. ""Is that normal?"" Will flinched and looked away. Taking it as a negative, Hannibal continued. ""Does this happen often?"" ""Sometimes."" Will whispered. ""But I have it under control."" ""Arguable."" the dragon said. He sighed before standing and dragged Will with him. Before Will could say otherwise Hannibal flung him over his shoulder. ""Hey!"" Will objected, but there was little else he could do. He was tired and embarrassed and all he wanted was a good night""s sleep. However, he doubted he would get the latter. Hannibal brought him back to the nest and set him upright once more. In an instant, Hannibal transformed into his true form and

""Uh...no..."" he replied. ""It was quite a few years ago...but it was around two in the morning, I guess, and I had gone into your room to see you.

Why can""t I contact central command?"" ""I can""t reach traffic control either."" Droids started gathering by various terminals to sort through the mess that Anakin was making. Staying low, Obi-Wan slipped between crates slowly, mindful of his very pained ribs. Carefully, once the droids were looking elsewhere, the Jedi master slid up the ramp of the Action VI transport. He needed to move carefully, as there were still droids on the ship, but none outside heard the sweep of his lightsaber. There. Now for the tricky part. Sitting down, Obi-Wan slipped into meditation and started to harness his own focus. Outside, the droids were getting more confused until a panicked cry over the PA system announced Jedi were in the facility. ""Jedi? Well, what are we supposed to do?"" ""Go fight, I guess."" ""But we""ll be in little pieces before we can fire a shot!"" ""It""s our programming."" The droid sighed. ""Roger, roger."" As the droids continued to try and order themselves, the Delta-7 fighter slowly started to move. It gracefully eased its way across the hanger. The droids paid no attention to it, since ships were always coming and going in the spaceport. There were no questions as the fighter boarded the freighter. With a sigh, Obi-Wan slid out of his meditation and smiled. He had quite the present for Anakin. Now to get out of here. The Action VI may have been designed for a minimum crew of six, but take off remained the same, no matter what ship one was piloting. He didn""t go far. The freighter landed by the river they""d crossed two days prior and Obi-Wan went in back to

Text2: This book didn""t have anything either. He frowned heavily. As a member of the Galaxy Garrison, any cadet had the same required courses in first aid. After all, one was going to be out amongst the stars for months, possibly even years at a time as they explored the far reaches of their solar system. Being able to handle colds, broken bones, burns, those were all standard, as well as a long list of mental disorders such as isolation and its effects on the human psyche. The largest concern was post-traumatic-stress-disorder. If something went wrong on a mission, there was no doubts that PTSD could occur. All cadets knew the signs and the rough basics of treatments. Watching Shiro, Keith had no doubt that his only friend was suffering from whatever ordeal he had gone through. Shiro""s hair was turning white after whatever had happened in the year since the Kerberos mission went bad. And Keith had only one goal. Learning all Shiro""s PTSD triggers so that he could prevent them. Yet Keith didn""t dare start anything without refreshing what he knew. He didn""t want to mess this up. It was Shiro. He couldn""t afford to fail or stumble. So Keith went back to his shelves to pull another book. At his chair, he once more glanced along the perimeter, listening to the natural sounds of the night and then glanced back at Shiro. Only the glance back showed the small white kid coming over with the laptop. ""Here,"" Pidge said softly, ""I think this is what you""re looking for."" A glance at the screen showed a website and lists on PTSD and various treatments. He looked to the kid. How...? Pidge shrugged. ""It was pretty obvious."" The kid looked away. ""He""s going to need a lot of help."" Keith","{""output"": ""YES""}"

She rubbed some sparkly blueberry lipgloss onto her finger and then applied it lightly to her lips, brushed on a small amount of blush, and considered herself ""made-up"".

Author""s notes: Hehe, yes, I know this chapter was pretty short and pretty frivolous but I felt it was necessary to the story and chapter 7 is going to be rather lengthy, so I figured I separate the two. See! Don""t get mad! :D!! Also, the title of this chapter ""A Telephone Call"" is stolen from Dorothy Parker...not one of my favorite writers, but that short story is EXACTLY the emotions that will be portrayed a little further on in the story (and a lot in this chapter as well) To Budgie- Great minds think alike my friend!! ^_^! I had been planning on sending Tai to Tokyo (mwhaha! The power of the author) after the typhoon and you""re review gave me the encouragement to finally write that chapter ;) To Kahlia- Of course you can have James! ^_- But I""m not quite done with him yet ;) To everyone else- *Blushes gratefully* Thank you immensely! Honestly, on crappy days, your reviews are the only things that keep me from going completely insane! :) Chapter 7: Tai arrives at TAGAT, Taiora fluff ensues...but is everything all sunshine and flowers?

Text2: They walked in to find a very distressed looking professor at the front of their class. The trio exchanging questioning looks, but got no answers. ""Please be seated,"" Professor McGongall announced, her steady voice shaking only slightly. The whispers flooding the room broke off abruptly. The curious class obeyed, all eyes glued on their teacher. Professor McGongall gazed back on them, but try as she might to stop them, her eyes hit one student in particular. ""Open your textbooks to page 787 and read chapter 19, ""Manaimi Transfiguration"" in its entirety. If by some chance you should finish this before class ends, move on to the next chapter. Your quiz on this next lesson will be worth half off your grade, so I suggest you use your time wisely. If any of you so much as thinks of talking, you will fail this class and lose your house the House Cup. I kid you not."" The class was dead silent. None of them needed to be told McGongall wasn""t kidding. Her voice was ice cold and her eyes alone looked like they would burn a hole straight through you. Hermione looked absolutely beside herself, fumbling madly for her book with intentions of rereading the 200 page chapter at least 4 more times. ""Ms. Granger, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, if you would please follow me,"" McGongall said. Hermione became completely frantic. ""Professor, I was just getting my book out! I""m sorry! Please! I can""t fail this class! I didn""t mean to-"" If Harry didn""t know any better, he could have sworn he saw some kind of deep pity in McGongall""s eyes.

792,"Text1: ""But you enforced it."" He quickly cut in, noticing how fast she could quiet down. ""Maybe I did..."" At that moment, she decided to avoid any further embarrassing statements. ""So Captain Hitsugaya why did you call me up here?"" His playful smile turned back into his usual apathetic expression. He avoided her eye contact and reached into his sleeve, pulling out a small velvet box. With one swift hand motion, he tossed it right at her and she caught it. ""Open it."" Hitsugaya said. Confused, Naori opened the box. At that moment, she only stared at the content. Her eyes widened in shock and her mouth dropped open, making her hand instinctively reach up to cover it. Behind her, fireworks were going off one after another, leaving huge, colorful flashes of light in the sky. It illuminated him and her and left two long shadows along the roof. Slowly, he took one deep breath, ""Will you..."" The young shinigami held the orange-haired baby close to her body with shaking hands. Naori""s golden eyes crept above a lush green hedge to survey all of her surroundings. When any of her fellow officers passed by, she quickly ducked back into hiding and silenced Masaki from any noise. ""Damn...it""s completely surrounded. That""s what I""d expect from Captain Hitsugaya."" She mumbled to herself as she took another peek. The entire division area was completely occupied by ready-to-attack officers. Each door and window, all the roofs, and inside all rooms, were covered. She could probably guess that the only room not occupied was her captain""s barracks. That was her goal from the very beginning. Quietly, the girl leapt out from her hiding spot and flash stepped as far as she possibly could. But a large horde of officers got in the way of her path.

Text2: He sat down beside her but she didn""t notice, too busy trying to translate something particularly difficult. He ran his arm up her leg that caught her attention all right. She gasped, was Draco Malfoy doing what she was thinking he was doing? He pinched her as if reading her thoughts, she felt the pain and realised it wasn""t a dream. Jumping up she knocked the chair over but took no notice. ""Malfoy,"" Was all she could say, she was speechless and embarrassed, why had he just done that? Draco looked into her eyes, filled with lust, the way she flushed was so alluring. He grabbed her arm and pulled her towards him, running his hand up her side and sliding under material. Regaining enough thought for speech Hermione cried ""What stunt are you trying to pull?"" Draco stopped for a second trying to process the question, Hermione took this time to pull herself out of his grip and leg it from the library and headed up to the tower. When she entered she saw Harry and Ron crossing the common room, on their way to breakfast, she followed them out, realising that she had left her things behind as she passed the library. Her face tinged red, ""Erm, Harry, Ron, I forgot my work, can you come with me to get it?"" She needed their protection, encase he was still there. Once they sat down for breakfast, Hermione thought back to the incident in the library. What was Malfoy thinking? She wondered, forgetting her breakfast completely. ""Hermione, are you okay?"" Harry asked concerned, she had some funny look on her face and he wanted to know if something had happened to her. Hermione came back to earth and answered, ""Uh, I""m fine, just something strange happened, it was really","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Olivia walked over and stood with her hands on her hips before the oldest Stabler boy ""Why, why do you continue to do this?"" she asked. The blank stare she was met with was hard not to laugh at. Rick had been doing this to his little brothers for years. Olivia and Elliot had hoped that it would stop someday but Rick seemed too set in his ways. ""Go apologize to your brothers,"" Elliot sighed. Rick nodded and went out into the hall. He knelt down in front of his two little brother""s and smiled at them ""Hey guys, sorry I scared you,"" he said softly ""I was just having a little fun. Are we cool?""

Text2: Palpatine threw his head back and continued to scream. He had been tricked! He had been fooled! He""d allowed himself to believe that Anakin was no longer a threat! He was furious. Someone would pay for this betrayal. He would make sure of it. There would be no escape. He would find and punish all who had a hand in this deception. He would make sure that when he found those responsible that their suffering would be unmatched. After several minutes the screams died. The bodies and shattered transparasteel dropped to the floor and Palpatine exited the mausoleum to where his guards stood stone still in quite a bit of shock. ""Contact Imperial Center!"" he commanded gruffly ""Have Pooja Naberrie arrested immediately and held until I can return and question her myself!"" The guards nodded and dispersed while Palpatine went in search of the other members of the Naberrie family and Queen Kylantha. He would question Kylantha and if she so much as hesitated for even a second, he would kill her. On Coruscant, Senator Pooja Naberrie was long gone when a contingent of Imperial stormtroopers came to arrest her.

794,"Text1: ""What""s not too bad?"" Jack asked, hovering by his shoulder and trying to get a better look at the drawing the Doctor was examining with such care. ""Not brilliant, per se,"" the Doctor continued, angling the paper away from Jack in his musings, ""But nothing to sneeze at either."" Jack raised himself up on his toes to try and get a better look, and wondered if the Doctor was holding the paper away like that on purpose. The remainder of the Torchwood gang, as well as Donna and Martha, were now arranged in a respectful semicircle around their two acknowledged leaders. ""Capital idea, actually,"" the Doctor sounded surprised. ""What!"" Jack growled in frustration. The Doctor looked up from the sheet before him, into the eyes of the seven humans watching him intently. He managed to meet them all. It was unnerving to someone unused to his mannerisms. Donna and Martha waited patiently, knowing that, sooner or later, his own desire to prove just how smart he really was would win out over his natural reticence, and he would explain all of his thought processes to his companions. Jack, though equally familiar with the Doctor""s ways, was considerably less patient with them, and stood next to him with his head tilted arrogantly and his hands perched aggressively on his hips. The remainder of the Torchwood team, being only passingly familiar with alien life forms in general, and lacking entirely in experience with Time Lords, collectively wavered under that burning gaze. Gwen caught her breath, and thought inexplicably of fire. Of the hiss of gas and raging flames, and smoke, which was not smoke, but was somehow thicker and more deadly and absolutely terrifying. Her breath caught in her throat and she looked uncomfortably away. ""So you found something then,"" Owen asked

Millie had never grown up, whatever she said. Meryl watched clouds race across the hazy blue of the sky. A hot wind blew hair damp with midday sweat from her brow. One of the kids screeched as the play got a little too rough. Millie stood with comforting words and moved to break up the altercation. Meryl""s eyes drifted closed.

She curled up on top of her blankets, it was too hot to do otherwise, and drifted off to dreams that, for once, didn""t involve him. She dreamt of the kids and the park. Of screaming laughter and childish tears. She dreamt of bouncing balls and swings and jump ropes. And smiling blue-green eyes. In the morning she was sick again.

It seemed someone ripped out that section of the mosaic. ""We should probably find that piece of the mosaic. Maybe it could give us a hint as to why Robin""s father came here."" Eggman said. They nodded and the group seperated looking for the mosaic slab. Luckily, Sonic found it in one piece beneath some fallen rubble. ""Here it is guys. I""ve got it."" Sonic said. With Robin""s help, he carefully fitted the slab into the empty hole in the mosaic. On the slab was the king holding some kind of lamp in his hand. ""Hello. What""s this?""

""I just want to remind you of who you really belong to, and what I can offer you if you cooperate."" Spectra said seductively. As Danny held her breast he knew something was wrong. Her breast did not feel the way they looked! As he had suspected, she""s using an illusion spell to make herself look far more sexier than she really was. Which explains why she always wore transparent clothing around him rather than just coming in the nude. This revelation has caused him to completely lose interest in her, and to think he almost wanted to sleep with her that one time. ""I""ve always known where my place is mistress,"" Danny said as he kissed her on the forehead. This caused Spectra to feel giddy with anticipation. She began to lean forward about to kiss him on the lips when suddenly... *knock*knock*knock* They heard a knocking on the door.

""I have things to discuss with Veil in private. GIRL things!"" she reiterate. ""Until a more opportune time then,"" Danny said as he kissed Spectra on the hand before leaving.

Tall jagged peaks stretched up and down the coastline as far as they eye could see. Saphira looked down and spotted two urgals on horseback.

He didn""t remember the conversation. ""Charlie. What do you have for me?"" ""All right, all right. I""m just trying to make friends."" Charlie pulled out a paper bag from his jacket pocket and spilled the contents onto the table. There were about eight different pill bottles and some folded up pieces of paper. House limped over to the table, wincing with each step. He picked up some bottles to look at the prescriptions, and opened one of the paper slips. It contained two beige pills. He looked over at Charlie. ""Where""s the Vicodin?"" Charlie was quiet for the first time since he stepped through the door. ""Look, House, that""s all he had. He said it was a slow week."" He looked apologetic. ""But hey, I got you that anti-whatever shit you""ve been wanting for like a month. That""s some good shit."" He pointed to the bottle labeled ""Azithromycin.""

Basically it""s a writing practice where you turn on your Mp3 player or Cd player or I-pod and make the songs shuffle. You have to write different situations regarding the first ten songs you hear. I know you""re only supposed to write during the duration of the song, but there""s no possible way I could do that, so I usually repeat the song until I finish the little part. Anyway these little drabbles may or may not include my oc, Volt. So if you don""t know who that is then please refer to my fan-fic ""The New Recruit."" Warning: Slight Lockdown X Prowl implied. Transformers Animated is not mine. Simple as that. 1. Alex Ubago- Sigo Aqui (I""m Still Here Spanish version) Bumblebee sighed as he slowly walked into the main room of the factory. As usual he was being ridiculed by Ratchet, or being told to grow up by Prowl. Even Prime and Bulkhead found faults to nag Bumblebee for and he was getting fed up by it. So what if he wasn""t a war veteran, a stealthy ninja bot, a bulky klutz, or even an Elite Guard dropout? That didn""t make him useless did it? ""Hey Bumblebee! Want to play with me?"" Sari asked the yellow mech, coming up to him from behind with two game controllers in her hands. ""Sure!"" Bumblebee answered pleasantly. At least Sari could relate to Bumblebee. She seemed to understand him more than his own kind did. Even if he was in just a ""rebellious programming phase"" as Ratchet had said it, Bumblebee was glad he had a friend like Sari to spend it with. 2. Savatage- This Isn""t

""They""re already being taken care of,"" Clu tells her. He attempts a reassuring smile, but it comes off as looking rather false. ""All you two need to worry about is Rinzler here."" The male program nods, seemingly satisfied, and Clu hands him my disc. The female program seems more hesitant, but also nods slowly. While the male program fits my disc into the reader, the female once again comes over to check my restraints. Once again, she keeps her head down, focusing only on her task. ""You don""t like doing this, do you?"", I whisper to her, a note of sympathy in my tired, still somewhat pained, voice. She seems like a decent enough program, but she also seems... afraid, both in general and, for some reason, of me. I wonder if that fear is what is driving her to do this, and what sort of lies Clu might have told her to feed it. She pauses. For a moment, I think she won""t answer, but finally, she whispers back, barely audible even to me, ""It""s the only way... I""m... I""m sorry. But... there""s no other way..."" She trails off, going back to her task. Before I can ask her to elaborate, she hurriedly finishes her check and walks back to the middle of the room, giving a small nod to Clu and the other blue program.

Carefully resisting the urge to touch the window and gaze in any further unseemly curiosity at the mist-shrouded city or the water streaming along the glass, he turned away from the view and gathered his robes around himself with slow and deliberate movements. Though his clan had always been known for an uncompromising command of logic and steadfast adherence to ritual protocol and ancient ways, he found that here - on Earth - even in the smallest of matters such as efficient movement, the discipline of logic was necessary. He brought his fingertips together and reflected on that fact. Despite decades of diplomatic training on numerous planets, a lifetime of the teachings of logic, and a clan-culture of dignified restraint, this particular world unsettled him in a not-unpleasant way. Just like fog. The transport dipped and slowed, gently swiveling into a docking port of an island once known as - he checked his father""s notes - Alcatraz. He arched an eyebrow as he skimmed the history of the locale. When the transport came to a complete stop, he patiently waited for the hurried passengers, mostly Human but some Andorians and other Vulcans, to disembark first, then slowly rose and retrieved a satchel from overhead. Satisfied he had everything, he turned to exit the vehicle and immediately colliding with something, or rather, someone, smaller, softer and - as the briefest of psychic jolts from the contact implied - as equally unsettled in a not-unpleasant way. He gathered his robes about him once again to recover from the unexpected physic contact. As he did so, he couldn""t help noting that the Human female he""d collided with had hair the color of the sands of the Forge. Her books and the contents of his satchel were now scattered

For a second, I didn""t get it. I just sat there slowly rubbing my hand, perplexed. Then it started to dawn on me. Longarm""s hard, suspicious tone, that ""sticky paws"" comment, the fact that everyone now knew I was, used to be, a thief, it was all sweeping over me like a tide. I heard Inferno""s voice in my head, ""How do we know you won""t suffer a relapse?""... I felt myself spinning off into orbit again. I couldn""t think properly. Everything that had just happened was starting to sink again, and I had no base to keep myself from crumbling. I stood up shakily. ""I... I think I""ll get back to work now,"" I stammered, dazed. ""Alright then,"" Longarm said. He was now doing something to Blackout""s optic and didn""t look up. ""Bye Gridsy!"" shouted Blackout, still oblivious. I walked away slowly at first, slightly dizzy. Then I started to run. I started running faster, sprinting almost. I ran like Megatron himself was after me. When it occurred to me that I wasn""t going at top speed, I transformed and drove as fast as I could. I""m still amazed that I didn""t hit anyone, I was going so fast.

802,"Text1: Hermione had received the shock of her young life when the door had suddenly been pushed open and Minerva had rushed in. A horrifying abundance of anxious fears and worst-case-scenarios had hit her; McGonagall finding her in this very delicate and compromising position had been the centre of them. She had felt her heart clench at that thought and had visualised the dead certain disappointment and indignation in her former mentor""s eyes who had secretly always had the status of a caring grandmother to Hermione. In this very moment, Hermione would have gladly sold her soul if the ground had just opened up and swallowed her. Leave! For Merlin""s sake, Minerva, leave! Please! Feverishly, Hermione had kept her nose pressed against her wand on the wall, terrified to let it drop and thereby drawing highly unwanted attention to herself. She had listened closely to the dialogue between McGonagall and Snape; not daring to breathe. Hermione hadn""t realised that she was starting to shiver increasingly; her fear meanwhile creeping into her every bone, taking its physical toll. The moment she heard McGonagall utter her name, Hermione jerked, the book she had been balancing got into a slanting position and...fell to the ground. Ooooohhhh bugger! ... ""Did you hear that?"" Minerva McGonagall asked suspiciously, wand at hand. ""Now what was that noise?"" Cocking an eyebrow, Snape was glad he was still blocking the headmistress"" way back into his office. Trying to save the situation from escalating, he skilfully downplayed the awkward situation by replying nonchalantly. ""One of my books must have fallen off the shelf. Nothing to worry about."" Minerva looked at him with narrowed eyes. ""Why would one of your books just fall down the shelf, Severus?"" What a nosy woman McGonagall was at times! Inwardly frowning at Minerva""s natural female

I answered and smiled wickedly and he sat dumbstruck, ""Then your lips remained virgin until the met mine and became sullied and impure,"" I said and we both started laughing. ""When did I tell you this?"" He asked surprised. ""A game of truth or dare, summer of my 5th year, the second time we met."" I said smiling. He smiled too. ""You must have really been in love with me if you remembered everything from 8 years ago."" He said grinning and how could I deny that. It was true after all. ""I forgot to ask. You had any girlfriends since me?"" I asked nonchalantly after our pizza was laid down in front of us. ""Yeah, tons of them. The women really want guys who had been under the Imperius curse for almost 2 years."" He laughed at his own joke but I could just stare in horror. I had completely forgotten. He noticed my discomfort and quickly changed the subject. ""How about you. Any boyfriends?"" He asked. ""I know you just got out of a ""serious"" relationship but anyone else?"" He too pretended to be disinterested in the information. But I knew it affected him. Without realizing it, he had just drowned his piece of pizza in Parmesan cheese. He looked down and continued to eat it as if he meant to put that much cheese on. ""Nope, I was clean for 5 years and then Hunter came along.

As I said in the announcement, I was having trouble. ^_^ Thankfully, I""ve been able to load the new chapters today! Enjoy, ne? Chapter 4 Yuki glanced across the van, then quickly looked away when he met glaring crimson eyes. It was still the same, an entire day later. The moment Yuki had been forced to admit what animal he represented, Kyou""s hatred had been obvious. The moment ""mouse"" had left Yuki""s mouth, Kyou had tensed as though he was fighting the urge to jerk across the room and deck him. Once they""d been told their new mission file would be sent that night, Akito dismissed them for supper. It had been a horrible experience, everyone in the meal room staring at them, whispering. There were multiple person teams, but never with the Seekers. For there to be one now, rumors and speculation had not taken long to circulate. Tohru had attempted to get a conversation going. However, even her cheerful and friendly words only received short, one word replies. As for Yuki, Kyou had ignored him completely other than to glare at him. Yuki glanced forward, looking out the front windsheild of the van. There was not much to see, as the roads were nothing more than underground tunnels. Lights and concrete. They had received their mission report, just as Akito had told them. It was slipped under their door just before lights out. Derek Gouser and

The other two are Sacium and Seracio,"" Grendall stated calmly to the class, as though both boys weren""t glaring at him. ""What exactly does it do?"" Malfoy questioned, a sharp edge to his voice. ""Well, it""s quite simple. Say you and a friend end up in the middle of a Muggle city. You are afraid that you might use magic, even unwittingly, and cause trouble. Or, perhaps, you are in danger from an opponent who wants to learn a certain spell off of you. There are some people who hunt down those who know rare spells and force them into telling. With the use of the Sarcio branch, you can keep yourself safe in both situations,"" Grendall stated. ""It keeps you from being able to utter any spell-casting words without the help of the person whom you casted Sarcio with,"" Hermione added. ""Correct!"" Grendall said, beaming. ""Sarcio works for one week, Sacium for a month, and Seracio for a year."" ""So we can""t use magic for a week?"" Harry asked, shocked. ""How the hell are we supposed to do our work in class?"" Malfoy demanded. Grendall looked taken back for a moment. ""Watch your language, Malfoy,"" he said sternly, then grinned. ""As Hermoine pointed out, the two of you can still use your magic. You simply need to cast your spells at the same time. Since Slytherin and Gryffendor have their classes together, that shouldn""t be too difficult."" For a brief moment, Harry wanted to curse.

When he realized the position he was in, he immediately removed his arm and sat up. ""Well, that was fairly compromising."" ""There""s someone outside,"" Will said urgently, standing up and grabbing Frederick""s arm. He dragged him up off the couch to the door of his basement just as Frederick registered the words. ""Oh, shit,"" Frederick said, glancing around the room as Will opened the door. ""Frederick!"" he said, stealing back his attention before ushering him down the steps. ""Don""t forget the glasses and the bottle!"" he called from the bottom of the steps and Will nodded. He shut the door, picked up the glasses and empty bottle of whisky and decided to just throw them all in the trash in his panic. He rushed to a window and looked outside in time to see Jack walking up the steps of his porch. Will stepped away from the window and waited until the doorbell rang, waiting still for a few moments after that. He stumbled his way to the door, trying to look like he""d just woken up when he opened it. ""Jack?"" Will said, squinting at the morning light that poured into his home. ""We need to talk,"" he said, waiting just outside of Will""s door. Will felt hesitant, nervous about him finding something that showed he hadn""t been living alone, but he couldn""t say no. ""Come in,"" he said as he stepped out of the way. Jack stepped in and removed his hat before taking a seat. Will moved with him, sitting on the couch opposite him, and looked up expectantly.

He disentangled himself from her clutching limbs, stood up and went into the bathing chamber. He looked at himself in the mirror, the familiar face, the hair hanging around his eyes, the bites and cherry-marks on his neck, the bite mark on his left shoulder, then he turned abruptly to the privy and threw up. When he had rid himself of dinner, he sat back, breathing slow, deep breaths, trying to regain his control. He hoped he had not awakened Evil-Lyn, for she might find this reaction less persuasive than his earlier ones had been. He sank himself in her tub and scrubbed his skin until it stung. Chapter 9 When Evil-Lyn walked into his cell the next morning, Adam scrambled to his feet, not feeling at his best. He hadn""t slept much, and what little sleep he""d gotten hadn""t been restful.

There were 52 hopefuls today and only 20 places open. The small number of students in the classes made sure that everyone got help with whatever they were struggling with. Not that Sven would struggle with anything. Sven scanned through the crowd, trying to see if anyone was interesting enough for him to talk to. He didn""t want to become friendly with someone today, only to have them fail their exam. A girl standing on her own caught his eye. Her long blue hair curled slightly and she had an air of confidence around her. She wasn""t bad looking either. Sven crossed the distance between them so he could start a conversation with her. She ignored him as he went to stand beside her. Sven wasn""t used to being ignored. Even at only 14, he had a knack of attracting girls. ""Hey."" He said and the girl finally looked at him. Her eyes reached the tip of Sven""s nose, he noted. ""I""m Sven."" He held his hand out for the girl to shake it. Girls loved stuff like that. This girl however, didn""t seem to be like most girls.

Everything that was expected of me, I just wanted it to stop: the attention, expectations, responsibility, all of it. I became fond of failing, leaving things half-finished and imperfect. And I apologies if I let this get between us. "" Nasuti was surprised to say the least. She always considered Seiji somewhat of a perfectionist, but at the same time it made sense.

Jak tossed him the scepter and asked, "" Didn""t we do that in Tripoli?"" Vin paused to look at him. He held the scepter tightly. "" Say, by the way,"" Jak pointed the eye patch on Vin""s left eye. "" When did you...lose your eye?"" "" Oh,"" Vin laughed and pushed the eye patch up. "" I didn""t. I just thought it made me look a little more dashing."" Jak snickered a little before he ripped the eye patch off his head. He pointed out into the distance and said, "" Come on. Get to work."" Vin nodded. Jak walked ahead with Daxter while Vin talked to Keira behind them. "" You""re not exactly catching me at my best,"" Vin chuckled. "" Oh, I""m sure I am,"" Keira smiled in return. They looked up at the sound of a horse whinnying. Vin gulped when he saw thirteen men on horseback dressed similar to Sig""s style of clothing. Sig was with them. He climbed off his horse and walked up to Jak and Daxter. "" I knew it,"" Vin muttered. "" I""m gonna get shot."" Jak nodded slightly to Sig. "" These doughboys are the commanders of the twelve tribes of the Wastelanders,"" Sig said when he reached Jak. He turned around and called, "" Mar!""

She knew that his physiology was different from that of a human""s and therefore made it harder to keep him down for long.

Tea! What about tea?"" Jackie realized that she was rambling but she actually grew nervous when someone she cared about, even if it was an awkward albeit charming alien, was in pain. She never knew what she could do to help except the excessive mothering, or so the Doctor called it. The Doctor gave a tired smile. He""d expected this from Jackie; she disappoint.

He sighed when the equally professional voice on the other line announced that they""d like to have him as a guest lecturer in two weeks to a month and asked if he was available. How many times did he have to tell these people that he wasn""t available? Maybe he should send the call to House - then they""d leave him alone. Out of courtesy he checked his calendar, pleased to find it full for the next two weeks. After that things get a bit too open for his liking. As expected, after he alerted the young woman to his full schedule she asked about three weeks from now. He refused to groan but he did let his annoyance seep through in the rough tone his voice tends to take from time to time. ""I""m sorry, I""m not sure about three weeks from now,"" he informed her, flipping his calendar to the mentioned time to peruse it more closely. ""It seems I might have some time on the 23rd but-"" ""-That""s great, I""ll call your assistant and schedule you in,"" the woman interrupted, not willing to listen to his oncoming excuse. The dial tone that greeted his ear wasn""t a welcome one and he had to resist from slamming the phone down in anger. Great, just great! He watched through the glass balcony window as Wilson soothed his latest patient""s worries then escorted her out of the office.

810,"Text1: I climbed out my window and slammed it shut. I climbed down the ladder of the fire escape. I jumped down and landed lightly on my feet. I looked around the alley. Rats ran by my feet, I squeaked and jumped backwards. I bumped into something but before I could turn around someone grabbed my shoulders. ""Hello there darling"" a man whispered in my ear. The sound of his voice sent chills down my back. I tied to wiggle out of his grip but the man""s fingers just tightened. He chuckled, ""Well it looks like I""ve caught me a fighter"" ""Let me go!"" I shouted. The man chuckled again. ""No way. I""ve done girls older than you but I don""t mind doing you. You""re really cute"" He breathed on my neck, giving my goose bumps. He dragged me further down the alley. I squeezed my eyes shut and wished that the man would go away. Suddenly I felt the man let go of my shoulders. I spun around and just like Ripple I saw the man being dragged away by darkness. He screamed but I just glared at him. He had tried to hurt me. He deserved to be consumed by the darkness and that""s exactly what he got. *~Four years later~* ""Hey Alari, come over here and give Mikey some sugar"" A tall guy with dark skin yelled from the steps of his apartment building. I rolled my violet eyes and yelled back. ""Not a chance Mikey!"" Mikey""s friends started to laugh. I heard one of them yell. ""Oh Mike you just got rejected by a homeless girl!"" ""A hot homeless girl"" another laughed. I rolled my eyes again and kept walking. Everyone knew who I was in this neighborhood, mostly because I was the only sixteen year old

Text2: I was grateful for the warmth that welcomed me when I walked inside. The teacher""s eyes widened a little when he read my name on the sheet of paper. He mumbled that he was sorry for my loss. I was glad when he didn""t force me to introduce myself. They already knew who I was anyway. Bella Swan""s cousin. I sighed and took a seat in the very back of the room. The teacher, whose name was Mr. Green, droned on and on about the history of Julius Caesar. I yawned and doodled in the corner of my notebook. The only interesting thing about being in advanced classes like English was that seniors were in your class. From my seat, I spotted Mike sleeping in the front row. Not far from him I saw a guy with super pale skin and red-brown hair. I stopped breathing for a moment. Edward was in my English class. . . . ""Holy shit"" I muttered. I widened my eyes and clamped my hand over my mouth. Mr. Green stopped his lecture and glanced at me. ""Thia, did you say something?"" Everyone turned around in their desks and looked at me, except Mike who was still asleep. I glanced at Edward. He was looking at me too with those odd colored eyes. I looked away from him and gave Mr. Green my sweetest, most innocent smile and shook my head. He nodded but still looking suspicious and returned to his lecture. I let out a small breath of relief. I glanced at Edward again. He had his back to me and his body was lightly shaking. I widened my eyes and grinded my teeth together. Even though I hardly knew the guy, I thought he was a jerk.

""Maybe one of the hands was injured during the storm,"" speculated Diego. ""I""ll go look for her."" He started to head out the door as Victoria moaned as another contraction came over her. Ana Maria grabbed his arm. ""Diego, don""t leave me here alone,"" she pleaded, her lovely brown eyes filling with tears. ""I don""t know what to do by myself.""

""I""ll get someone else to go look for Maria,"" he said. He understood his daughter-in-law""s panic. He didn""t know what to do either. Sure, he had helped with the births of many calves, foals and lambs, that was true. But this was his wife. And she wasn""t supposed to be having this baby for another six weeks. The odds that it would survive were slight. And he didn""t want to think about how he was going to deal with that possibility.

814,"Text1: When the team woke up, the Doctor and the TARDIS were gone. Jack was too happy that they were alive to doubt the Doctor""s reasoning; he pushed out lingering doubts by justifying that the Doctor had saved his team""s lives. Ianto and Gwen went along with it but both knew something was different; they could feel it in the way the rift seemed to flow through their skin and Jack""s manufactured truths fell hollow even though he believed them. When the truth came out some months later, it was ugly. Jack called Martha first, then the Doctor to demand an explanation. The Doctor would not come but he told Jack that immortality was only the tip of the iceberg. At that, Martha searched harder and came up with startling results. Both agents were immortal but neither was a fixed point. When Jack died, he had been tied to the time vortex and eventually generated fixed point energy. In Gwen and Ianto, the fixed point energy fused together rift and vortex energy, tying them to the rift. They were not generating any of their own energy; they were feeding off what came through the rift. Since the three forces were keeping each other in check, if one decreased or increased without the other two it would destabilize and destroy the host body from the inside. They would die just as they almost had that night with the Doctor. Worse, the destruction would be explosive and probably take out a good kilometer in every direction if it happened. Their bodies needed a plentiful source of vortex and rift energy as much as food or water. That meant they needed to live over the rift, the only source of such energy on earth and the only source in the universe they knew was

In fact, they gave me a wide berth as I hauled back on the bolo, chakra burning in my aching muscles, until I felt the shinobi""s trachea collapse. As I eased the body to the ground, I broke the neck with a sharp twist, just to be sure. Then I took off running in the opposite direction as the panicked civilians - toward the growing fire.

The fire was moving towards me as I approached ground zero, so I had to detour onto the roof of a stone warehouse to get past the flames. The clay roof tiles were nearly hot enough to raise blisters, and I wondered how far the fire would spread. Then I shook my head. Not my problem. The alleyway was redolent with the sickly-sweet smell of burnt flesh. Five charred skeletons smoked on the scorched stones. The crates, bundles, and junk were all gone, reduced to a fine spray of ashes that settled in my greasy hair and coated my throat. I

Text2: (Disclaimer: This is from the beginning of ""The Hunger Games: Tribute Guide"". I own NOTHING! DON""T FUCKING SUE ME!) Reaping Day- District One- 5:00 pm (Theirs is later than some districts...just because) I smiled sadistically. This was my prime. I was 18 years old, beautiful, strong and, overall; I would be the best tribute my district would ever see. A freakish woman stood before the crowd. She had long pink fingernails that looked like talons, whiskers like a cat""s and she was dyed a light lavender colour. No, really, her skin, her hair, her dress; everything was this pretty shade of pale purple. I recognized her as our district""s escort: Violet Viola. Her name was ironic, due to the colour scheme she followed. Next to her was a blond girl I recognized as Dakota, who""d be my mentor. There was no male mentor this year. The video from the Capitol ended, and she squealed. ""May the odds be ever in your favor!"" ""Ladies first!"" The woman said in a sing-song voice, walking in her freakishly high heels towards the fishbowls as if she would die if she didn""t know immediately who she was sending off to the Capitol.She pulled a name from the bowl.""Amy L-""she began, but I cut her off before she could finish saying the girl""s name, with a loud ""Uh, hey! I volunteer!""""Oh! Of course"" she laughed, embarrassed. She was recently transferred here from one of the loser districts, the ones where tribute was a synonym to ""corpse"". Whiny little babies... I strutted up, confidently, towards the stage, my gorgeous black hair flowing in the wind, behind me.""And what""s your name, dear?"" Violet asked as I made my way to the microphone.""Heather. My name is Heather Hamilton."" I told her, proudly. I smiled at the camera, and","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Then we started to tease Anna paired up with the fox-eyes guy and then it was my turn to get teased with the raven haired guy. And of course i kept on blushing again and again. After that, our day was over, it feels so quick, time flies away when you""re having fun, right? By the way, will I see that raven haired guy again? Wait, of course I will, he""s in the same school with me. Hmm, what will happen when I saw him? Will he recognized me? Well, I can figure that out tomorrow, and I""m pretty nervous too. *sigh*. I hope I won""t get tongue tied or stare at him al the time. This is really bad, i don""t really believe love at first sight. But, maybe, is this what people call love at first sight? Maybe there is a hint of fairytale in my life, eh? Wonder what will happen tomorrow... Tomorrow will always come, and the lady luck is still playing on their lives. That""s the 2nd chapter !

She made sure not to make a noise as she pushed open her door, and tentvily walked out into the hallway. She couldn""t hear anything, but the closer she got to the living room, the louder she could hear voices. Not just those belonging to Ludwig, Venezaino, and Gilbert, but also three unfamiliar voices. She got to a corner just outside the living room, and peered out with curious green-blue eyes. She studied the three unfamiliar men that were talking to her family. They were somebody she""d never seen before, but who could they possibly be?

""Sounds like a kids game with pretty effects, and it doesn""t count."" ""What?! If we didn""t stop them- AHHH!"" Daxter screamed as Parker stepped onto a platform, it crumbled under her foot, both of them falling downwards. Parker felt Jak grab her hand and them jumping to the next one, only to have it crumble as well. She jumped to the next one as it crumbled, she moved to jump to the next one but was too slow as she fell downwards. Jak grabbed her hand again, yanking her upwards. She flew upwards and knocked Jak over with an oof sound. She bounced off his chest and rolled down the hill, stopping down the hill at another platform that collapsed when her arm hit it. Her arm hung off the side of the drop as she watched the platform crumbled to the sharp rocks below. She took in a staggered breath as she moved away from the edge. Jak slid down the hill, stopping just by her. ""You okay?"" He asked. ""AND, that""s why I don""t travel by Parker!"" Daxter shouted from Jak""s shoulder. ""She""s a walking death trap!""

""Speaking of which, how was your lesson with Syaoran-kun?"" ""Were you eavesdropping?"" Kurogane saw Fai smirk and knew his suspicions had been confirmed. ""Then you already heard what I said."" ""What you told him on the walk back was very profound,"" Fai informed him mischievously. ""But I have a question for Kurogane-sensei ..."" ""What is it?"" Kurogane asked gruffly, fully expecting an idiotic question from an idiotic mage. ""What about love?"" Fai had an indecipherable glint in his eyes. ""Isn""t love the greatest weapon of all?"" Kurogane was speechless when Fai kissed him.

It was sad enough that his right leg, arm, ear, and eye was burned off in an explosion, but to not give the patient enough drugs to ebb away the pain that came with the surgery... That was what Dr. Steel was like. The man was insane and many people claimed he preformed whack job experiments on his patients. Sometimes Silver thought he was a participant in one of them. Amelia came back to the room, just as Silver began to believe he misheard the honorable Captain... but was there a possibility he misheard her twice? ""So, er... what did the good doctor say,"" he asked, trying his best to keep his cool. She smiled. ""Well, as it seems, he""ll begin preparing his ""infernal machine"" immediately. You and the real Mr. Hawkins will meet at this address,"" she said as she grabbed a piece of paper and scribbled down something and handed it to him. He took it, and thus his anxiety began to come back, for there, in a neat scrawl was the name of Doctor Francis J. Steel. He got up quickly, his fear apparent on his face. ""I""m sorry, Captain, I""ve got to go!"" Amelia looked out of the corner of her eye and motioned for Silver to sit. ""Easy, Mr. Silver, easy... I see from your sudden anxiousness to leave, you have a bad history with this person. But believe me, he only means to help-"" Silver couldn""t contain it anymore, he just couldn""t. ""Oh yeah?

Blake rolled his eyes. ""Naturally."" The man raised an eyebrow. ""Well. That was easy. Usually, I have to pry it out of someone."" He shrugged, lowering his hand as he realized he no longer needed it to torture someone who was offering the information he wanted willingly. ""What is it?"" Blake sighed. ""Nothing you need, Sylar. Believe me."" The other eyebrow joined the first. ""Right. You know my name, which means she told you about me."" He gestured to Alyssa""s body on the floor, bringing a wave of bile to Blake""s throat at how casually he handled the murder. ""Meaning, you are either a close friend, or family."" Blake tried to nod. ""Family."" ""Which explains why you have an ability."" Sylar nodded approvingly. ""But that brings back the question of what your ability is."" Blake said nothing. Sylar smirked. ""Fine. Have it your way."" He raised the finger to his forehead again. Blake rolled his eyes. ""You don""t scare me, Sylar."" ""Why?"" Sylar""s eyes narrowed. ""Because you can""t die, perhaps?"" Blake snorted. ""No. I can die."" Sylar smiled. ""Well, then."" He sighed. ""I know how things work. Just like you."" He tried to shrug. ""I inherited it from my father.""

""Natsuki."" he murmured as he looks at his wife with pride, for she brought another their creations into this world. AN: Yay,a look back when Natsuki was born! I think any sensible person will probably faint after something as stressful as that. Creation seems to be a good theme for this because having a baby is bringing a creation to the world. Yue, Akito, Natsuki, Ranmaru and Sano belong to me. Kaien, Kentori, Yuri and Reni belong to Wolfking 101. All the rest belong to bleach! Reviews are loved! Kaien sat on the 7th division roof, watching Komamura play with his two year old daughter, Akito. He smiled to himself, glad that his foster father has found happiness with children of his own. ""Hey, Kaien."" Kaien looked up and smiled at the newest member of the 7th division. His name was Yasuo Tsukino and he was an anthropomorphic wolf like Komamura was, except he was about Kenpachis height, his fur was black and his eyes green. He also went through some of the abuse that Komamura went through, but he was so optimistic that nothing seemed to bring him down. ""Hey."" he greeted as Yasuo sat next to him, smiling at the adorable scene as Akito piggy backed on Komamura. ""Its strange to see someone of my kind like this.""Yasuo said thoughtfully ""The people around here don""t like us all that much.""

Ratigan only nodded, realizing that""s probably where Isabelle got that saying from. Ella then looked at her granddaughter. ""Honey, get yourself patched up and then meet me in the back room. We gotta have ourselves a talk."" AN: Here we finally meet Norman! I based him on Reverend Harry Powell from the film ""The Night of the Hunter"" and also Claude Frollo, from the Disney version of a Hunchback of Notre Dame. Heh, crazy priests. Technically, Norman is a preacher, which means he could get married. If I had a voice actor, it will be Alan Rickman, cause along with Vincent price and Jeremey Irons, he has a very distinctive voice. Also, he kinda sexy. So, here we have Norman, who tracked down Isabelle and as you can see, his view on rats still ahsnt changed. Isabelle slaps him and he reacts quite badly. This is the main reason why theses two never got along. Also, Isabelle is still reeling from her mothers death and has gone to alcohol for comfort. Ratigan wants her to open up, but she cant. I know a lot of you wanted Norman and Ratigan to have a confrontation, but this story is really about Norman and Isabelle, the confrontations between them. Also, Ratigan didn""t say anything to Norman when he was making his speech cause he knows this is Isabelle""s fight and the last thing she needs to deal with is a mauling.

The Dursleys passed the three wordlessly carrying groceries as they sat finishing their movie. It was some British horror film but it turned out to be more of a comedy then a chiller. After the movie was finished, they noticed Petunia making supper. Rachel rose and offered to help her. Harry and Tonks stayed seated not really knowing what to do. Rachel began to chop some vegetables with precision for the stew while Mrs. Dursley prepared everything else. The meal was almost done when suddenly Mrs. Dursley let out a long scream and jumped onto a chair waving her arms madly. ""What""s wrong?!"" Mr. Dursley asked springing from his previous position in from of the kitchen TV. His wife only made whimpering noises and pointed near the door. Their eyes went to it. And two beady eyes looked back at them. Mrs. Dursley screamed again, ""Rat!!!"" she managed to get out. Mr. Dursley thundered over to the rodent wielding a broomstick. He began swatting at the terrified creature which in turn scampered through the dog door that had been built for Marge""s visits when she""d bring Ripper. Mrs. Dursley remained on the chair until the dog door had been taped, boarded and barricaded up. Mr. Dursley tried comforting her but her eyes stayed fixed on the door. Rachel was left to finish dinner but it didn""t bother her. It gave her the opportunity to leave out the avocadoes; she just couldn""t stand them. Tonks joined them for dinner; to the Dursleys dismay whose only mutter of disapproval was along the lines of ""imposing barbarians"". Just as the ladies were collecting the dishes, Mrs. Dursley paused looking out the kitchen

Ryou has been stuck in this for god knows how long and look at me, it""s only been a week and I""m a mess. I don""t know how he does it..."" Akeno sighed and decided to take a shower to clear her mind. She locked the door to feel secure even though she knew Bakura could undo the lock easily. She let the hot water pour over her, easing the tension out of her sore muscles. Closing her eyes, she tried picturing being at home. She imagined the scent of her mother""s cherry blossom shampoo that she would sometimes use and the feel of their bathmat under her toes. Her chest tightened at the memory. It was so long ago yet it seemed like the other day. She wanted to push all of the pain and anguish she went through the past few years from her mind, absolutely everything, but that simple memory. But she just couldn""t fool herself. She opened her eyes and was disappointed to see her reality, the inside of Ryou""s shower. She made to sigh then stopped herself. The sting of her cuts and bruises was a constant reminder about last night""s events and made her further efforts to enjoy her shower futile. The shower-head sputtered off a few moments later and Akeno stepped out, careful not to slip on the tiled floor. Soon, she realized she hadn""t brought in a change of clothes. She bit her lip, listening to the silent apartment. It didn""t sound like Bakura was home... then again he wasn""t a very noisy person.

He found a spot on the ceiling of the little hut to stare at. That was such an interesting stain. ""Get him a bed."" Alex stared after the Sergeant as he left willing him to come back. It wasn""t that he liked the man but at least he wouldn""t kill him. Turning back to the Unit he was supposed to hang out with for the rest of his training he found that Wolf guy about two inches from his face, glaring. Alex took a step back and leaned back to get away. ""Personal bubble!"" he exclaimed. Wolf was not amused. ""Who are you with?"" he asked, well, more of a growl really. Alex purposefully ignored the question. ""I""m currently single, and how about yourself? Any special lady friends?"" ""You know what he meant,"" another guy, Fox maybe, snapped. ""Yeah I did, but that""s classified. Ask another question."" ""What are you doing here?"" Wolf asked. ""Classified. Try again."" Wolf growled in frustration, Alex thought he might be a growler, and shook his head. ""What?"" he asked feigning innocence. That notion was wiped out the second Wolf grabbed his collar and tried to drag him forward as if he was planning on strong arming the answers out of him. Alex lashed out on instinct, driving his right knee into Wolf""s stomach and as the man""s grip loosened he threw a fake punch which the man blocked only to be hit with a punch from the other side and his feet knocked out from under him by Alex""s leg. ""A-oooo."" The mock howl earned him a glare to which Alex

Text2: To Harry it wasn""t okay but he really didn""t have much of a reason to leap up off of the man without making himself seem even more damaged than they already thought he was. But then the man shifted and his arms came around Harry. One arm supported his back while the other brought the boy""s feet up so that he was curled up on top of the man. This also meant that Malfoy could see his face. ""Have you slept at all tonight?"" the man asked. Harry wondered how much the man knew about his sleeping patterns but decided not to chance it. He shrugged. Malfoy frowned. ""You need to sleep more."" ""So do you,"" Harry retorted, annoyed. He looked at Malfoy a little closer and really wasn""t all that surprised to find what he did. ""Are you drunk?"" ""A little,"" the blond admitted. Well, that explained this sudden need of his to cuddle. Harry vowed to never go near Malfoy again unless absolutely positive that the man was sober. He abhorred the idea of being a teddy bear. ""That""s bad for you,"" Harry responded truthfully. Really, it was. Liver damage and all that. ""Do not worry about it Harry,"" the man responded with a slight slur. The blonde""s arms came around the ""boy"" a little tighter. ""Do you have nightmares?"" It was such a strange question considering who was asking him. If it had been anyone else he might not have laughed in his face. Might. ""I fail to see what is so funny about this,"" Malfoy frowned at him. But Harry couldn""t stop giggling at the absurdity that was suddenly his entire life.

She relaxes into his embrace, letting her eyes close for the moment. They could stop at this point and she would still be content with the progress they had made. She knows he is happy and secure with her trust in him. He will no longer hide and run away from her now because they have stepped upon this path and he will walk the whole way with her. Erza feels herself growing tired, despite the warmth and liquid pooling between her legs and the fluttering of her stomach and the ache of her body. That is until Jellal stirs from his spot and shifts so he can hook a finger into her underwear, immediately causing her to come back to consciousness. Their eyes meet, brown and brown, boring into one another with silent communication. She smiles encouragingly and once more lifts herself off the sheets so he can use both hands to tug her underwear down from her waist. He doesn""t stop until he has pulled it away from her feet. Once removed, she feels it is her turn to be shy as he takes in her body, devoid of all clothing. His eyes stay locked with hers as he admits in a quiet voice, ""You are beautiful Erza."" She tries to distract herself from his gaze and takes his hand, guiding it where she wants it to go. Jellal""s fingers are cold and cause her to shiver when they brush against her core. He twines his free hand in her hair and beckons her forward to kiss her deeply. Erza responds eagerly and presses herself closer

Text2: Seto huffed but made no attempt to go against the suggestion. Roland gingerly unbent his master""s arm from where it was curled across his thin chest. For this he received a torrent of hisses but he was not deterred. He could easily feel that the bones in this arm weren""t all where they were meant to be. Grimacing as he heard things click and pop under the pale skin he gently returned the limb to its former position, deciding that to hook it around his neck in order to lift Seto was a bad idea. Instead he leant over, scooped one arm under Seto""s neck, the other under his knees, and gently lifted him. Seto gasped at the cracking of his kinked vertebrae, wriggling slightly as Roland shifted his weight. ""You seem to making things more complex than they have to be"" he grumbled. Roland merely shushed him like a cross mother hen before awkwardly bending to open the rear door of K4IBA1. Seto soon found himself lying flat on the long seat in the back of his once beloved limousine. His nose was already stuffed with his own congealed blood but he felt the stench inside the car nearly drown him. Groaning with pain he twisted his head sideways to glance over at Campion who lay unconscious opposite him and nearly gagged. Seto had made it a skill of his to ""zone out"" to the degree when he couldn""t feel time passing anymore. It helped him get through all those terribly boring days in the office.

At least, it would prove that she couldn""t transport herself from one reality to another. Then how could her grandfather be evil? Alicia instantly backed away from McCoy, sliding herself across the floor. The second her eyes made contact with his, McCoy smiled that warm smile towards her, the one smile that was always directed at her, whenever she appeared in the room. (In her own reality) But that smile suddenly changed, to something more sinister and Alicia knew from that look alone that he was only mocking her as if playing with her fondest memories, mental challenging her. If this McCoy was evil, was Kirk the same? Had she somehow altered reality, yet again? Kirk""s POV Face to face with the most ruthless and dangerous man he had ever come across. Khan kept turning up at just the right moment, ready to go another round which annoyed the hell out of Kirk. He was getting so damn tired, mentally and emotional. Once upon a time, he would have liked nothing better than a good fight. It was the only way to get his adrenaline going. Bar after bar, hooking up with a girl or getting into a good fight - Either one was the highlight of his night. Sometimes he was a lucky bastard and had both. But things were different now; Kirk had responsibilities, mainly to his crew, who were god knows where. So getting into another fight with this guy certainly wouldn""t be a wise decision. He would only end up hurting himself in the long run. Especially, up against someone like Khan, who acted as if

They didn""t seem to notice him at all, like he was phantom. His breathing became heavy as he slowly opened the door and saw the screaming woman.

""""Chefs do it with good taste,'"" she read aloud, following it with an exasperated sigh. He smirked slightly, sliding the white apron over his head. His read, simply: Chef. When he had finished tying his apron around his waist, he raised an eyebrow and rubbed his hands together. ""You ready?"" ""Sure."" She shrugged apprehensively, and then watched as he suddenly approached her. Stepping back a few feet, she realized he was headed to the sink, and relaxed slightly. They stood side-by-side at the faucet, trying to wash their hands at the same time. Again entranced by his hands, she watched the fusion of tendons, fingers, and soap, sliding over each other in harmonious motion. Once or twice he caught her lost in thought, and nudged her with his elbow. For the next minute

""I""ll have to have him teach me that trick one of these days..."" she muttered, pushing the door open. Sam watched her leave and then glanced around at the vacant office, both loving and hating the brief silence it presented before the second shift arrived. The car offered no solace from the case. Somehow, every radio station was playing the same track, or discussing the same issues. Impending war. Inadequate schooling. What kind of memorial to put at Ground Zero. The never-ending battle of the sexes. Pollution in the Hudson. Potholes on the West Side highway. Sighing, she switched it off, regretting her decision to drive this morning; she hated being alone in this car. Her entire existence was so ironic sometimes; making a career out of looking for people, yet pushing them away when it came to her own life. All but one, it seemed like lately. And as she blew on the top of her coffee to cool it, she suddenly turned onto the Northbound 95, fully aware that it didn""t lead anywhere near her house. After a short while she tore her gaze from the road and glanced out the windows. The sheer amount of foliage caught her off guard, and she checked the next exit to make sure she hadn""t gone too far. A few minutes later she passed the Connecticut State line, and then saw the ramp she wanted. She almost turned the car around three times as she made her way down the streets and past the lights. What was she going to say, anyway? Would the door be slammed in her face, or would she go in for a","{""output"": ""YES""}"

She wanted Dumbledore to just say what he had to say, to not beat around the bush. ""Miss Granger, your parents have been acting strangely all summer,"" Dumbledore added, throwing Hermione into greater confusion. ""All of these things stem from one fact. One fact, Miss Granger, that even you do not know."" ""What is it, Professor?"" Hermione demanded, impatient. Dumbledore did not need to be pointing out gaps in her knowledge to explain her health issues. If anything, his skirting of the issue was just increasing the labor of her poor heart. ""Miss Granger,"" Dumbledore sighed, his genial façade crumbling away, ""you are not the daughter of Walter and Michelle Granger."" Before Hermione could say anything, Dumbledore said, ""Miss Granger, please just let me say this all at once. You are not even a muggleborn. In fact, you are descended from two houses of ancient lineage. Your mother, Charlotte Gravois, hailed from the noble French house of Gravois, a respected French wizarding family. On that side you even have living relatives, including a grandmother,"" added Dumbledore, attempting to give the young witch some hope before continuing, ""and your father, Tom Marvolo Riddle, had a muggle father and a pureblood mother who was descended from the House of Gaunt, the blood of Salazar Slytherin in their veins.

""That civilian advis-"" ""I""m a Class 1 passenger aboard this ship, Captain,"" interrupted Trinidad, who, like Bastila, emphasized Onasi""s military rank, ""and therefore warrant your valuable time."" Carth gaped. This drunk, late, sketchy woman a Class 1 passenger? Class 1s were generally diplomats, planetary leaders, celebrities, or royalty, not random people that looked as if they had been just pulled from the street! Carth nodded his head, and inwardly decided that it was just another odd Jedi demand. ""Right this way, Ms. Trinidad,"" sighed Carth, as he led the newest addition to the Spire aboard. Bastila groaned as she watched the final crewmembers of the Endar Spire board the ship. This was going to be one long mission. Rec Room of the Endar Spire Carth took a deep breath before entering the most relaxed room of the Endar Spire. He had just come from another meeting with Bastila, and his patience was already fraying at the ends.

Eventually, the DJ put on another slow song at which point Yuffie made a bee-line for Vincent and dragged him back out onto the floor, babbling something about how he had promised to dance every slow dance with her. Even though his reason for coming to the table had gone, Leon saw no reason to move, and soon the chair next to him was occupied once more by a grinning blond who promptly stole the wineglass from Leon""s hand and drank from it himself. ""You have your own,"" Leon complained, successfully stamping down on his own grin. ""Yeah, but it""s all the way over there,"" Cloud replied. ""I don""t feel like getting it."" He handed back the wine with a murmured ""Thanks,"" and stretched out more in the seat, letting his feet push forward and his back slide halfway down the chair. ""Not going to dance the love ballads?"" Leon teased as he secretly let his gaze slide over those slim yet muscled legs. His boyfriend just snorted at him and refused to grace him with a reply. Instead, he tipped his head backwards and closed his eyes in obvious fatigue. Smiling, Leon left him alone and returned his gaze to the main part of the room. The floor was not as crowded as for the faster songs, but he could still see most of the younger group of guests out there with their dates. Riku and Sora were dancing together and looked quite sweet, in Leon""s opinion. Nearby, Kadaj and Kairi danced together although both of them were paying far more attention to the other couple, watching them openly and whispering together now and then with grins on their faces.

To spend an amount of time such as that with one person, and to still not be able to stand it when they were not around...

They walked around a street corner and Seto""s house fell into sight, and Jounouchi noted that Seto""s car wasn""t in the driveway. Not yet, Jounouchi thought, but Seto had promised that since he was skipping school to go into work, he would be home earlier than usual. Yuugi followed Jounouchi up the front steps and into the house, and then Jounouchi led him into a room just around the corner from the front door. ""He gave you a key?"" Jounouchi answered with a sly grin, and then pointed over to a desk that sat in the far corner of the small room, surrounded by filing cabinets and shelves lined with textbooks and stacks of old papers. ""Seto""s school stuff,"" he said and smirked. Jounouchi snickered quietly, and Yuugi looked all around, noticing that Seto really liked to hang on to his old homework.

Where in a cave, she didn""t know. For that matter, who was she? And who were those men who had tied her up, and why had they tied her up? What had she done? Her whole body ached, and her head was pounding so hard, that she thought it was going to explode. She tried sitting up, but the dizziness combined with the ringing in her ears, made it difficult. She laid back down on the hard dirt floor and closed her eyes, hoping that would make things better. She briefly caught the smell of coffee and what she thought were beans cooking over a campfire, as a small breeze blew the aroma toward the cave. She felt her stomach growling as she thought of how good those odors smelled. She opened her eyes again as she heard one of the men walking toward the cave. As Pedro entered the cave, he noticed Victoria had awakened. He looked at her and smiled. ""Well, I see the pretty Senorita is finally awake,"" he remarked. Victoria gazed up at Pedro, trying to figure out who this man was and why she was in this cave. Pedro grabbed her by her arms and quickly pulled her up.

She then shifted the topic to Kisa, saying she had gone to America so she could meet a specialist about her anxiety that developed over her lifetime, especially since she started Middle School. Kisa had nuzzled into Tohru""s lap, and had fallen asleep there. The whole time Tohru just brushed through her hair with her hand while talking to me.

His, dare he say it - fur - was matted with blood and dirt, and he had no idea how he was going to get all of the stains out of his clothes. His mom was going to kill him when she found out. His head shot up at this thought. His parents. How was he going to tell them? How would they react? He had always known that he had been adopted when he was a baby, but would they still want him when they saw what he was? Or worse, would they treat him like an animal? Would they even recognize him? He was so lost in his concerns that he didn""t realize the bathtub was starting to overflow and quickly shut it of. He sunk into the warm water and tried to relax. It felt really good on his sore muscles, and after a few seconds he started to fell a weird rumbling feeling in his throat. He

He""d been on enough covert missions to know all the tricks. Steve made it to the roof without being spotted, despite a near miss with a cat in an alleyway, which had been mewling loudly at him, as if he might part with some food. Steve had apologised to the feline, as he was only carrying food fit for humans with him. Besides, who knew how long he might be out in the jungle for. He""d never been to Africa before, so navigating might prove difficult. He""d charged his phone, but that would only last so long. Up on the roof, a jet was waiting for him as promised. The jet had a giant Stark logo vinyl on the side. He got in beside the pilot, and pulled the door shut behind him, ""Your boss ever hear of subtlety?"" Cap quipped. The woman turned her head and gave him a sardonic look, ""Of course not."" The flight lasted far longer than Steve was comfortable with. Four hours into the twenty hour flight and we was itching to go faster. He gave the pilot his best pleading look, ""Sir, that isn""t going to work."" She sighed. Ten minutes later she relented, for whatever reason, and gripped the gear stick, ""You don""t say one word to Mr Stark about this."" She said, before pulling the gear up. With the jet now going at double speed, Steve relaxed. They still had another eight hours to go, maybe he could convince her to go at triple. Hours later, when they finally reached North East Africa, the pilot spoke up, ""I should warn you Sir, they

Once Sougo was loaded into the ambulance, Kagura whirled around and pointed a finger at Kondo, ""You! Make sure he doesn""t do anything stupid."" She ordered the commander. ""A-Ah right."" He nodded, ""We""ll keep an eye on him, right Toshi?"" He turned to his subordinate. Hijikata smirked, ""The guy does what he wants."" The vice captain muttered over his cigarette. Having no choice but to go home, Kagura began trudging through the snow back to Yorozuya""s apartment. She could not go in the ambulance because she was not family, and she did not even know why she wanted to. She hated the idea of leaving Sougo alone though. What if his condition became worse? She might never get to confirm if he had been serious. Of course he hadn""t, she reassured herself. Sougo had only ever teased and fought against her. In this one fight he had assisted her because he considered her stupid brother was a bigger pain in the backside than she was, that was all. He was just spouting crap jokes because of a concussion. She sighed, reluctantly resigning to returning home. She would have to forget the whole incident. Several days passed, and Kagura was no closer to forgetting about Sougo""s hospitalisation.

Darkness descended for the briefest of seconds allowing Kid to slip his black cloak on and slip into the shadows casted by the spot light. As he past Ran he gently pushed on her shoulder as a sign to tell her to kneel down. She complied at once and placed her hands on the now smaller shoulders. A collective gasp came from behind Ran for in the moment of darkness the crowd had only seen Ran kneel down and still had no idea what had taken place. For a second Ran didn""t say anything and for a moment Kid -from his vantage point in the shadows of the doorway- thought that she was frozen in place. Then tears began to leak out of her eyes again and she lunged at the boy on the floor and pulled him into her chest.

After Ran""s near bone crushing hug and many whispers threats that if he ever worried her like that again she would kill him, she had scooped the mini detective up and turned around for everyone to see.

Lauren""s eyes widened slightly as her gaze came to rest on a sword that hung low at his side, firmly tied to his belt-like sash. It was sheathed in an old leather sheath that appeared to be custom made for the older, plainer looking sword. She curiously peered a little closer at the sword and saw that the thin blade looked amazingly like an old samurai sword, like something she""d find in a museum. She glanced up at the boy""s face and wondered if he knew how to fight with the blade. That""d be so cool if he did! Lauren thought, tilting her head to the side. Continuing her gaze downward, however, she realized that he was barefoot. The pale skin of his feet strangely contrasting with the ground when all she was used to seeing was a colorful assortments of shoes. She grimaced in sympathy when she thought about what would happen if he stumbled upon a pile of broken glass. Then she caught a slight movement out of the corner of her eye and looked up. And there they were. A pair of strangely, dog-like ears, almost hidden in the mass of his hair. The ears twitched yet again and Lauren shrieked, stepping back, trying to get away from the strange and decidedly creepy boy. ""Oh. My. God.""

Perhaps it had suited her to have Virginia know her only as a woman Evelyn had loved, not as a woman who had loved another. ""He sounds like he was a very wonderful man,"" the American said simply.

When she felt the soft touch, Amy quickly debated if she should keep her eyes open, or close them again. She didn""t expect the kiss to last long. She was frankly surprised that Sheldon was actually kissing her on the lips. She had fully expected him to turn at the last minute and kiss her cheek. But that hadn""t happened. In fact, the kiss was going on... and on... and on! Sheldon was lowering one arm to grasp her around her waist. He pulled her up gently to bring them closer and more in line as he increased the pressure of his mouth slightly and began to move his lips over hers. When she felt Sheldon""s tongue licking lightly at her lips, her eyes flew open again. (She wasn""t even aware she""d closed them!) She tentatively parted her own lips, feeling a shiver as he gently slid his tongue past her lips and began to stroke lightly in and out. Amy wondered if Sheldon understood what that movement mimicked, or that open mouth kisses allowed a man to pass testosterone to a woman in his saliva, thus increasing the woman""s sex drive and improving the man""s chances of having sex with her. As the kiss continued, she could practically feel the cortisol levels in her system plummeting as stress left her body and oxytocin was released. She knew Sheldon was aware of all the muscles involved in kissing, but she wondered what else he knew about philematology.

He had never told the others about it, but there had been one night, apparently, that he had gotten drunk with Athos, and had become very morose, so much so that Athos, though it was perhaps hypocritical of him, had worried what he might do in that state. So no, he was not going to have this little girl belittle his grief just because d""Artagnan had overcome it. She flinched at his tone of voice and he sighed, rubbing his face with his hand tiredly.

There was no admiration in his gaze, like there had been in the others"" - only mild curiosity and maybe a touch of irritation. Calypso wished that he""d stop staring at her like that. She felt like a laboratory specimen (that was the modern term, right?), sitting there as some kook in a white coat looked at her and prodded her with pointy things. This boy was looking at her in a similar manner. ""I think you""ve punished the dirt enough,"" he said, his voice surprisingly gentle. She paused her digging to look up and glower at him. ""Just go away,"" she said bitterly. He shuffled his feet, seemingly uncomfortable. ""You""re crying,"" he said softly, looking her up and down. Great. Now he was pitying her. ""None of your business,"" Calypso muttered, annoyed. Why couldn""t he just leave her alone? ""It""s a big island. Just... find your own place. Leave me alone."" She gestured in a random direction. ""Go that way maybe."" He didn""t move. ""So, no magic raft. No other way off this island?"" She could feel her temper rising again. ""Apparently not!"" she snapped. ""What am supposed to do then?"" he demanded, crossing his arms over his chest. ""Sit in the sand dunes until I die?"" That option actually sounded pretty good to her. ""That would be fine..."" There was just one problem with it, however. She glared up at the sky and cursed again. ""Except I suppose he can""t die here, can he? Zeus! This is not funny!""

""Ah so you met Thor,"" Stark exclaimed. ""I guess so,"" I mumbled. I was starting to feel light headed. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. ""Dawson do something, she doesn""t look good,"" Mikenna exclaimed. Everyone looked at her, mostly because this was the first time she""d spoken since arriving here. ""No Dawson don""t okay I""m fine,"" I exclaimed. ""Okay what are you hiding?"" Natasha asked. I looked up at her, and she looked kind of mad. ""All right everyone who""s not related to her take a couple steeps back,"" Bruce shouted. Everyone reluctantly took a step back. ""Zina its okay you can trust us,"" Cap said, bending down next to me. I sighed. ""All right, but only because my head is really hurting right now,"" I mumbled. Dawson placed his hands over the cut on my head, and both his eyes and the cut began to glow. After a minute he lowered his hands. My head felt better, but I could feel dried blood all down the side of my face. ""Holy crap so you travel through time, and he heals people, so what can she do?"" Stark asked, pointing at Mikenna. Mikenna shrank behind me. I glared at Stark. ""Is there a bathroom I could use, cause I""d really like to take a shower,"" I asked. Oh but I""ll need some clothes. Damn.

All she did was ignore him and continue to make the coffee. Will sighed, annoyed, and moved closer to her. ""Spencer""s going to take Henry to the museum today."" He nodded slowly.

""...Holy Roman Empire..."" He looked away. ""He""s...he""s gone."" She gasped, seeing the young man drop the declaration and hold his head in his hands. There was no way that something like this can be possible. Yes, it was a little sad that Austria was a colony to a man that was a sixth of his size, but he had been a close friend (if not closer) to Italy. Italy... It had been a few weeks since it was revealed that Italy was a man. The shock from just thinking about it had rocked his core for days afterward. But he couldn""t help but feel extremely sorry for the poor boy now. He had loved Holy Roman Empire (despite the same gender), and to now tell him that he was gone...?

Steve was wearing a bright red sleeveless shirt which had matching red leather jeans and white and black shoes. His had a Japanese dragon on the back, which also said ""Playboy Bunny"" in Japanese. I didn""t tell him, though. It""d ruin the fun. Hwoarang was wearing something unusual, too. He had a white and lavender shirt with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows and russet pants.

Let""s just get this girl down to the Cave so we can treat her injuries, okay?"" Dick said, trying to calm his brothers down. Tim just sighed at his brother""s antics. Bruce glared at his second son, before rushing off to the Batcave. Alfred was already waiting for him at the open grandfather clock. Stepping into the elevator, he turned towards his sons, ""Make sure you follow us down and change into your costumes, just in case she wakes up there,"" he said seriously. This was no laughing matter, and he needed to convey that to the boys. Taking in the mood, the brothers all nodded and stepped into the elevator after it was sent back up by Alfred. In the medical bay, they walked in to witness Alfred hooking the girl up to an intravenous therapy line by her good arm. Her broken one was already wrapped up in a clean, white sling that rested on her stomach. The butler then proceeded to usher the brothers out, as he needed space to stitch up the large gashes on her body. ""As soon as she wakes up, we need to find out who she is and where she came from,"" said Bruce, now Batman just without the cowl, as he walked out of the changing room. At this, Dick frowned.

He saw how something shifted in her gaze, as if she was looking at him in a different light. He didn""t understand what it was she wanted to get across, or even if she was aware of what that was herself. He could do nothing but stay frozen on the spot, observing her, drinking her in, trying to read her. For her part, Ran was faring no better.

Their two bodies moved close so that they were eventually pressed against one another.

After a few minutes of such a passionate kiss they pulled away from each other as they heard the sound of the Impala purring down the road. Sam looked out the window through the net curtains and saw his brother pull up in his car and casually get out. He put his hands in his jacket pockets and started to walk up the path to her front door. There was a knock at the door which Chloe went and answered as she let Dean come inside. He walked into the Living room and saw the lipstick on Sam""s lips and gave his cheeky grin, as he then acted normal trying to ignore the pink on Sam. ""OK Lover boy, we got to go.

Susumu nodded in a fashion much like her son and quickly gathered her energy into a bundle and sped off to the fortress in a bright ball of light. Rin walked only a few paces more to the edge of the fortress grounds where a steep drop led to the ocean. She sat on the ledge and allowed herself to enjoy the serenity offered by the breakers. It had been awhile since she had time to come all the way out here- and made a promise to herself that she would make a point to do so more often.

Her eyes were circled by dark smudges that told of her many sleepless nights, but it was her eyes that screamed about what had happened. They looked both terrified and angry at the same time. His heart lurched as he thought of what might have happened and what it had done to her. Tears began to leak from her eyes, startling Atton; she never cried. Without hesitation, Atton took three long strides forward and his arms were around her, holding her close, one hand going around her shaking shoulders, the other cupping the back of her neck as she leaned into him, breathing unsteadily.

One stopped to adjust the load she was carrying, and as she puffed limp hair from her face, Jaime saw it was her. Her wide lips, her cheekbones... then he blinked, and she was gone. The serving girl gaped at him, revealing a missing front tooth. Jaime frowned, and she quickly cast her gaze down and kept walking. He leaned against a wall of an outhouse. Closing his eyes, the burning in them was like ground glass under the lids. He rubbed them harshly with his thumb and forefinger, as if he could erase the memory of the past few days, ever since he""d returned to KingsLanding.

There were no lessons on Christmas day so the gang all headed back up to the common room to play games, chat and try and persuade robin against revenge on Vaysey and Guy. The day dragged by slowly and by lunchtime all the presents had been opened and there was nothing left to do and nothing on TV except the queens address and no-one wanted to watch that! The girls, Marian, Djaq, Paula and Dean, decided that it would be fun to play some more truth, dare, kiss or swear but the boys reminded them of last time and soon the idea was dropped.

Sokka begins to ease himself slowly forward, holding his spear poised above his shoulder. He makes a gesture for Katara to follow and she does, however reluctantly. She senses an elephantine presence pass by her with a waft of pungent musk-odour: she turns her head to see the hulking figure of the herd""s bull striding languidly by, its pointed horns held high.

Before he could make another gratuitous utterance, the shadow""s mouth was covering his, their tongues were rolling over each other""s and Ryou moved a hand to grab at the shadow""s hair, as though to hold him there. The shadow made desperate mewling sounds, the breath escaping through his nose because Ryou wouldn""t relinquish his mouth, and ground against him frantically. Ryou yanked on the shadow""s hair hard and screamed at the top of his lungs when he peaked. He couldn""t tell if the shadow""s strangled wail was because of the hair-pulling or simply his own completion. Previously taut muscles lost interest in holding the shadow up and he collapsed against Ryou, panting. Before either of them had got their breath back, the shadow was kissing him again, pressing deep into Ryou""s mouth, his full weight still resting on Ryou. Ryou pushed him away after a while to let himself pant unencumbered, and the shadow moved his assault to Ryou""s jaw, ear and neck. Ryou""s primary thought, when the thick haze began to clear from his mind, was irritation at the discovery that he was apparently a screamer. He watched the ceiling blankly as his breathing slowly normalized, listening to the angry rattling of the Millennium Ring and the muffled little murmurs from the shadow. The post-coital bliss fought against aggravation that Ryou had let himself get swept up in that scene, but his annoyance found an excellent target in the shadow whom was lavishing affection on his throat. He let out something between a sigh and a snort before complaining, ""I""m hungry."" ""Mm?"" the shadow mumbled, lifting his head to meet Ryou""s eyes; his own were still hazy with lust. ""I""m hungry,""

""Dare,"" Ella started smiling evilly which was getting me scared since nothing ever good up when someone is smiling that way. ""I dare you to kiss Max on the lips for at least 5 seconds,"" Of course she would choose that, it""s like a typical cliché fanfiction story. I knew my life was predictable and overly normal but really? While mentally thinking to myself I didn""t notice that Fang had moved in front of me and was starting his dare until his lips were on mine. It felt surprisingly good not that I expected him to be a bad kisser or anything like that but it was just so much better than my first and only ex-boyfriend that I felt sort of sad for his sake. The five seconds seemed to last a long time and I was starting to respond to it when Iggy announced that the five seconds were over probably because he didn""t like seeing his sister being kissed by anyone no matter who it was.

Stark straightens, his huge hands clenching and unclenching - was he seriously afraidof Renard? Bullets had little effect on the Siegbarste, so why-? ""Prince,"" Stark growls, advancing on Renard.

Renard raises the gun slightly and fires off two shots in quick succession. Nick winces, covering his face with his mostly uninjured arm. There""s a resounding thud, and when he looks again Stark is lying on the floor, a pool of blood spreading from beneath his head. ""Are you all right, Nick?""

But he will wait however long it takes for this body to fully mature. Make a name for himself. He wonders if she will realize who he is. He hopes she does, hopes she worries, hopes she panics. Her end will not be quick. He does not owe her anything, and she decided her debt to him was insignificant. That was her mistake.

They are not powerful, but they are not weak either. He finds the strongest man with the weakest will, subjugates the man to his own will, and has that man (his name is Lancia) destroy the family that raised him. They are now an army of four, three children (well, adolescents now - but they are still children in all things that matter) and one delusional, unstable man.

Back turned against Harry, the slender form was concentrating on slicing some grapefruit without noticing a taller figure watching. Harry loved watching Draco. Not only because he was the person he loved most in the world, but also the prettiest human being Harry had ever seen in his life. He loved watching all of Draco""s tender, graceful moves, how his long silver-blonde hair spilled down to his shoulders like liquid white-gold.

The looks on the four""s faces said more than enough that they will most certainly not help him with this predicament. Athrun was shaking his head when he tried to ask for help from him. He looked at Dearka pleadingly. The Buster pilot merely shrugged helplessly and turned away from him, suddenly finding the ceiling so appealing to look at. Desperately, he gazed at Kari. The girl shook her head serenely, as if saying ""you brought this upon yourself, Kira"". Which he probably did... But even so... He was so desperate he even turned to Yzak for help.

This was too important to not say face to face."" Chichiri gave a nod. ""So, what was her response?"" Tasuki looked at her fiancee and gave a slight smile. ""I am glad I informed her of our past before I revealed that we are having a baby. She only yelled a bit.""

Text2: EPIC DRAMA TIME! Yukiko is just like Sessho mom, but worse! lol. Hope you liked though, and please review! Updates are being made in my mind! lolz, Seriously though, reviews are good, please do it! It fuels my update making! Ciao! ~Kagome Escape Chapter 23- Earth Kouga gaped at his crestfallen mate as she jogged to the fields. Hotaru caught a glimpse of Kagome as well and looked back at the wolf. Kouga shook his head. ""Yukiko got to her."" He explained and Hotaru understood. Kouga""s sister was a very spiteful woman with a quick temper and a selfish mind. No doubt she had disapproved of Kagome""s entry to the pack and the removal of her position. With that in mind, Hotaru decided now would be a good time for some more training. She followed Kagome""s scent to the fields and found said wolf youkai huddled in the grass, crying and fisting a clump in her hand. Hotaru watched as Kagome cried harder and the lump began to lift through her fingers and launch across the field. By the lumps of dirt around her, Hotaru guessed Kagome developed this on her own. Impossible...she needed to recite Earth""s mantra first! The Han kami no-nin is definitely shining in her. I fear she may soon pass me and automatically learn the other elements. Hotaru thought as she walked up to her friend. When she placed a hand on her shoulder, Kagome jumped, and the rest of the floating dirt dropped to the ground. ""Kagome-chan. Are you alright?"" she asked. Kagome looked up at her half dragon, half inu, and half human friend with deep gray eyes. ""Does it look like I""m alright Hotaru-chan? I just got denied by my own sister in law because I wasn""t born into a youkai! I can""t","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Oh and if you find it, don""t touch it."" Sakura replied as she searched among Seiki""s things. ""What are you talking about, Sakura-chan?"" Kero asked. He flew over to her. ""It may not be the Dragon gem after all."" She replied. Shaoran caught her arm and turned her to face him. ""What are you talking about?"" Sakura could see the seriousness in his eyes. She knew he wanted an answer. She took a deep breath and said, ""I""m sorry. I wasn""t that attentive yesterday. But we both touched it and you felt its power. I had my suspicions at that moment but I didn""t think of it at the time because I thought it was something that a person who came back from the dead would feel.""

How long were you keeping this feeling?"" Amano searched for the right words. It crushed his heart that he had found the chance he had long been dreaming of now that he had to let her go. ""Long enough for me to realize how stupid I was for not telling you sooner."" Hitomi just smiled at him. But she quickly hid her smile and said, ""Amano-sempai, if I told you that I felt the same way, I know it would crush you somehow. Looking into your eyes tells me that with my reaction earlier, you are hurting. I don""t know what the reason is but-"" Amano placed a finger on her lips to silence her.

The old-fashioned service flag2 in one of the windows cast a shadow on the room""s sole occupant. Barbara Grayson looked at the envelope in her hand, a rueful smile on her face. Dick had insisted the letters, like the heavy gold ring on her left hand, were traditional. He sent her emails fairly often, but once a month or so, he would send a letter instead. She had teased him about writing real pen-and-ink letters to Oracle, the uber-hacker, but he only responded that letters had more personality. And they were traditional. Her smile became a smirk as she thought back to Dick""s proposal two years ago. She had known he was coming by that evening; he was shipping out soon and wanted to see her before he left. She just hadn""t expected to see him outside her door wearing dress whites. When he actually proposed, she just sat there in shock. It must have completely unnerved Dick, because he began babbling something about wills and inheritances and powers of attorney, until she had finally hushed him by pulling him into her arms and kissing him. As Dick later explained, he had proposed for three reasons. The practical reason was that he had written his will so that she would inherit almost everything if he should be killed, and the whole process would be so much simpler if she were married to him. The emotional reason was that he loved her and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. The third reason

Ianto didn""t move, his eyes not leaving Jack""s face; looking straight through him, hardly acknowledging his presence. ""I know you played me. The suits, the coffees, the little smirks, the I love your coat, sirs; it was all to draw me in. But that night in the warehouse, that was something else. I could practically smell it rolling off you; you wanted what you saw."" Jack laughed suddenly, the sound piercing the tense calm of the room. ""All that time you were willing to risk so much, and all you could think about was how much you wanted someone else. I bet that hurt, didn""t it? Every sly grope, every slutty look, each one reminding you of just how being in love isn""t enough...it""s never enough..."" The suited shoulders began to shake ever so slightly with the effort of keeping still as Jack spoke, a fire stoking behind those blue orbs that Jack suddenly realised were far too deep for the boy he was. But there was no water there, no tears to shed; something in those eyes, behind the fire, screamed out at the world in anger, not in grief. Jack kept his eyes focused on those dark pupils, clasping his hands and putting them to his mouth thoughtfully. ""I know your type, Ianto Jones.

Jake helped Bella up and walked her over to the truck while Filene picked up Bella""s bike and pushed it along behind the two. ""I did see something in the woods."" Angela told the gang ""Totally."" Eric said. ""Baby, I believe you."" Jessica shook her head. ""No, he doesn""t. He""s just trying to get lucky."" ""Jess."" Filene nudged her friend, grinning before looking back to Angela.

""Emily, if you need anything, this is my card"", Erin said taking out one of her CPD ""business cards"". You can call anytime you would like. I will make sure to stay in touch with you until we find Ethan. I promise"", she continued to explain as Emily took the card from her. ""Thank you so much"", Emily said giving her a smile. Erin returned the smile as she rose from the couch and walked out of the house with Jay. There was a comfortable silence to the car, but as soon as the engine started Erin began to speak. ""Do you remember what I said to you when you took my statement after Mia was taken"", she asked him as she drove. Jay turned his head in her direction, watching as she didn""t even make eye contact with him, just focused on the road ahead. ""You wouldn""t rest until Mia is found. No matter how long it took you were going to be there when she was found. You told me you couldn""t live without her"", he said. Erin smiled briefly as she also remembered the statement she had insisted her best friend should take. A month later the case was cold, but she still never gave up. ""We have to find this boy. I don""t want that mother to live like this"", Erin stated as they approached a stop light and she turned to look at Jay. ""And we will find him, Erin"", he said giving her a smile which she returned. Nothing more had to be said. The light turned green and they were back

And a big surprise? Part 1 Kim P.O.V. It was three nights ago, when I was jumpy all night.I woke up to see Jack laying down next to me with his arm around me, I carefully lifted his arm, got up and then put a teddy bear in my place, but then I heard Jack mutter in his sleep ""oh Kimmy your so soft"" I almost started laughing really loudly but luckily I held it in. I looked at the alarm clock and shrieked in my head it was only five in the morning what was I suppose to do, what if someone killed me while everyone else was sleeping! I was about to walk out of Jacks room when I heard a small beep, curiously I turned around to find the alarm clock flashing the numbers starting changing, Jack disappeared, the bed disappeared, everything started disappearing, but then I saw a girl drenched and dripping with water which soon turned to blood she had a sinister look on her face and she started walking closer and closer to me, she pulled out a knife and stabbed me and then everything went black. I woke up in a old room with creaky wooden floors, I looked around and then I heard whispering voices, blood appeared on the walls saying ""your next Kim"", my eyes widened, then a voice started saying get out Kim get","{""output"": ""NO""}"
905,"Text1: He looked up from the report he""d been meticulously writing, making sure to highlight each and every person""s contributions, and turned his gaze on the last three people remaining in the bullpen with a fond glance. Everyone else had left, but his team had stayed behind to finish up the reports and a comfortable air of camaraderie had settled over the room. He couldn""t hear the conversation from inside his office, but it looked like Neal and Diana were engaged in some sort of mock argument while good old Clinton appeared to be biting his lip to stop from laughing and struggling to maintain his composure as he diligently composed his own report of the past week""s events. Still, Neal was grinning cheekily as he leaned back deeply in his chair, legs propped up on his desk, tossing that damn rubber-band ball in the air as he continued to tease Diana, who was growing increasingly indignant. As he watched, Diana evidently had had enough and stalked over to Neal in a couple of strides. With the same lightning reflexes he""d seen her display in the field, she snatched Neal""s beloved black fedora off the corner of his desk, placed it firmly on her own head and returned to her seat with a deviously wicked, triumphant smirk aimed straight at the guys across the way. Clinton gave up all pretence of trying to work and threw his head back laughing outright as Neal""s chair flung forward and he scrambled to swing his legs off the table to scowl at Diana. Peter felt his own lips curl into a grin as Neal""s scowl turned into a pout that had no right to look so endearing on a grown man. In any case, he""d been right all along and he""d even given Neal

Text2: ""It worked last time,"" Glorfindel said. Unfortunately, this was true. I stood with my mouth open for a moment, and Glorfindel""s smirk widened to an evil grin. ""Oh, very well then,"" I said ungraciously, turned, and stomped away. So perhaps Glorfindel isn""t as dense as I had believed. Fantastic. On the fourth day, everything changed. For the worse, I might add. The first bad thing that happened involved Lindir. This wasn""t surprising. Lindir is somehow involved in most of the bad things that happen in Imladris. Often, I must admit, he is the victim. Occasionally he is the instigator. In this case, he was more like a harbinger of doom... no, that""s not quite right. In this case, he was the harbinger of surprise birthday parties. It seems to me that the words ""doom"" and ""surprise birthday parties"" could well be synonymous. Anyway, it so happened that I caught him practically skipping through Imladris, a garland of flowers in his hands, and asked him what he was doing. A few minutes later, the truth was out. ""What did you say?"" I asked him. ""A birthday party? A surprise birthday party?"" Lindir gave me one of his self-effacing little smiles. ""It""s a human thing,"" he said. ""I know that,"" I snapped. ""My question is: why was I not informed? Was the party to be a surprise for myself as well?"" Lindir""s smile faded.""They told me not to tell you because you""d try to sabotage it!"" he said, wriggling. I watched his expression grow yet more miserable as he slowly realized that he had betrayed his lord by informing me of this. ""Now why would I want to sabotage Aragorn""s surprise birthday party?"" I asked, striving for some outer calm. By the way Lindir sort of wilted under my gaze, I""m guessing","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Abata no chuchi."" Stitch said. Gantu growled and roared. He furiously tried to stomp Stitch with his foot. ""You""re vile! You""re fowl! You""re FLAWED!"" Gantu roared, finally crushing Stitch beneath his foot. But suddenly, Stitch grabbed Gantu""s foot. ""Also cute and fluffy!"" Stitch shouted. He twirled Gantu around by his feet and flung him directly out through the roof of his ship and he ended up crashing on the beach far from their location. When Sora and the others arrived, Gantu was out cold. Nani and the others came rushing over. Lilo and Nani met in a tight group hug as Stitch watched. ""We did it! Lilo""s back with her family again."" Goofy said. Just then, they watched as a large space ship began to land. From it, out stepped a slender alien with suited men at her side. They grabbed Stitch. ""Oh no. It""s....the Head Council Woman."" Pleakley gasped. She eyed Jumba and Pleakley, as well as the passed out Gantu. ""Hmph. I see I made poor mistakes when selecting men to retrieve Experiment 626. Very well then. Men? Bring the prisoner aboard my ship and we""ll prepare to..."" she said. But just then, Lilo approached her. ""No! You can""t take Stitch. He""s apart of our family. I have a paper that PROVES it!"" Lilo said. She looked through her dress and took out the paperwork from the animal shelter. ""If you take him, you""re kidnapping."" Lilo said. Cobra approached the Council Woman. ""She""s right.

Text2: How could the kingdom still be alive today if this monster attacked?"" Amy said. Tails kept on examining the mosaic for any signs of clues. But the part that would explain was missing. It seemed someone ripped out that section of the mosaic. ""We should probably find that piece of the mosaic. Maybe it could give us a hint as to why Robin""s father came here."" Eggman said. They nodded and the group seperated looking for the mosaic slab. Luckily, Sonic found it in one piece beneath some fallen rubble. ""Here it is guys. I""ve got it."" Sonic said. With Robin""s help, he carefully fitted the slab into the empty hole in the mosaic. On the slab was the king holding some kind of lamp in his hand. ""Hello. What""s this?"" Tails said ""It says that the only way the evil monster was stopped was by sealing it in a enchanted lamp by the king""s power and then the lamp was transported to another world. It says that this way, the monster would never return to threaten the kingdom."" Knuckles and Sonic looked at the lamp in the king""s hand. Somehow, Sonic felt like he saw that lamp somewhere before. ""You did? Where?"" Silver said. Sonic looked at Silver. ""I don""t know. It feels like the answer is on the tip of my tongue but I can""t get it."" Sonic said. After Tails finished with the mosaic, he looked ahead at the passage leading deeper into the ruins. ""We might want to keep going guys. Our torch can""t burn forever.

Tommy muttered before throwing some money down on the table and stumbling out of the bar. Erin tried not to be angry with him, but really, what a child. If he wanted to keep a woman around, he was going to have to start taking care of himself. What had been a broad, happy, penniless kid who came in here four years ago trying to charm a drink out of her had transformed into a rich, successful shell of what once was. There was a demon dancing in that man""s soul. She had no doubt of that. It appeared that Tommy was going to have to be added to the ever growing list of regulars that she asked God to look out for before she found herself slipping off to sleep. It was a pity, it truly was. His talent was amazing, and his storylines were realistic and raw and the characters really did become your best friends and you felt everything they did. It was amazing what he could do with words, and yet, there he goes, drinking away his future glass by glas. A true Edgar Allen Poe. With the straggler gone, closing the bar became nothing but a cakewalk. She got the tables and counters cleaned off, the cash locked up really good, and everything was restocked. She smiled as she closed the door behind her, and pulled on the string around her neck that held the key. She locked McNeil""s up, and sighed, it was nearing three am now, and she couldn""t help but think she should""ve been home at least half an hour ago. The trek to her home involved three blocks in the cold, and a mad

The bars made her uncomfortable, and the idea of making one of those home? Well, it wasn""t outside, and it wasn""t some random house somewhere. It was stability, which she craved more than anything else. A walker fell from the second floor, and Cali sighed. Still lacking class. ""What do you think?"" Rick asked, and Camp Clueless sighed. ""Home sweet home."" Glenn mumbled and Cali snorted. ""Oh yes, because nothing says ""home sweet home"" like the bloody interior of the best correctional facility in all of Georgia."" She smirked and Daryl shook his head. ""Ah, this ain"" th"" best one Nia."" He smirked down at her. ""Trust me."" ""Well shit. Maybe someday I can move on up to Maximum Security."" ""Is it secure?"" Lori asked and Rick nodded. ""This cell block is."" ""What about the rest of the prison?"" Hershel added, and Rick turned towards him. ""Tomorrow, we""ll find the cafeteria and infirmary."" ""We""re...sleeping in cells?"" Beth asked, and Rick nodded. ""Found keys on some guards. Daryl""s got a set too."" ""I ain""t sleepin"" in no cage."" Daryl shook his head. ""I""ll take the perch."" Cali watched as everyone started piling into cells, paring off the way they did. At this rate, she""d probably have to be forced to room with Carl, who had won...again...and that wasn""t bad, but it wasn""t great either, but she""d worry about that later. She walked up towards where Daryl was, and sat down across from him, he rolled out a blanket and looked at her. ""Ya need ta get some sleep Nia."" ""You been in prison before?"" She asked, quietly, making sure no one could hear her. Daryl frowned, and sighed. ""Whut makes ya say","{""output"": ""YES""}"
908,"Text1: ""Yeah Ray"" Sam didn""t want the man getting his sentence reduced. What he wanted was for him to go to prison for a very very long time. Finally dragging his eyes from the floor Sam saw his own disgust mirrored in Ray""s eyes. ""What do we do now then ?"" Ray was exhausted but after hearing what John had said he knew that despite the hour he""d never sleep. ""I""m going to find Annie. Then I am going home. You heard the Guv. Charge the scumbag and go home. That""s what he said, we have done that so lets get out of here"" Sam pushed himself away from the wall as he felt the exhaustion overwhelm him. He knew that after hearing everything John had said that he wouldn""t find it easy to get peace tonight. He hoped that Alex and Gene managed to get some rest. At least the next day was Sunday, so the team would only be on call. Sighing he pushed himself away from the wall as Ray followed him back to the squad room. Annie sat in the quiet Squad Room waiting for Sam. It had been a horrible case and she was glad it was over. At least now they had someone in custody they could move on a little. They had worked all the hours God sent to make the arrest since the body of the first victim had been found. She knew Gene and Sam had taken it as a personal insult when more bodies were found. She sat in the darkened room thinking of how close it had been to going wrong. How close they had been to Alex becomming another statistic in the case.

""Ian, you remember back at the Plas? There were what? Three people firing at us."" ""Yeah."" Ianto frowned. He had no idea where Gwen was going. Literally or figuratively. ""So, when I joined Torchwood there were you, Jack, Owen, Suzie and Tosh. Then me too. Six of us. Six members of the team."" ""We""ve had some staffing issues."" Ianto didn""t want to explain to Rachel the reasons only three were left. He had loved each member that they had lost in his own way. Even Owen had been a friend. Despite all the teasing and arguing. He knew Owen had been a good bloke and a great doctor. And he had loved Tosh. To Ianto that meant he had to be one of the good guys. ""I see."" Rachel answered. ""But?"" ""But if there were only three people firing at us and they are supposed to be Torchwood London, where were the others? Why weren""t they firing at us?"" Gwen bit her bottom lip, deep in thought. ""And I want to know who the bint with the lipstick is and why she is so determined to kill me."" ""You can""t just go."" Ianto asked. ""I have to."" Gwen met his eyes, silently begging him to understand. ""Ianto, I have to. Anwen is out there and she needs me."" Ianto nodded slightly. He knew there was no way he was going to talk her out of it. Rachel shook her head, the fact the two younger people seemed to be oblivious to the danger they were in was beginning to get on her nerves. ""You two have a death wish."" ""Maybe."" Ianto replied.

She vaguely recognized the voice, but didn""t want to see who it was, she honestly didn""t care. This is really starting to be a pain in the ass. All I wanna do is go inside. Kamiko thought to herself. She turned to see a boy with silver hair not unlike her own. His hair was slicked back and he wore a purple tee shirt that said ""we""re all mad here"" and jeans with purple sneakers. Around his neck on a long chain was a Jashin pendant, almost identical to the choker around her neck. Her eyes widened a fraction. ""HOLY FUCK!"" the boy screamed when he saw Kamiko. ""Hidan!"" she screamed and ran toward him, enveloping him in a hug, luckily for her, he picked her up so she could reach his neck. After almost being crushed by the larger man, Kamiko was put down. ""what the fuck are you doing here?"" The boy, dubbed Hidan, asked, a grin spreading on his face. ""I could ask you the same thing!"" Kamiko fired back with an equally large grin. ""What no hug for me?"" A voice asked. Kamiko turned around a boy, much taller then her, with shaggy black hair. He wore a black papa roach Tee-shirt with baggy jeans and old beat-up converse high tops. ""Kuzu-chan!"" the small girl exclaimed, hugging the taller boy, who chuckled and hugged her back lightly. Before the two had a moment to separate, Hidan grabbed Kamiko""s shoulders, shaking her roughly. ""Where the fuck have you been for the past ten fucking years?"" he practically screamed at her. Kamiko opened her mouth to answer. ""Wait, you two know her, un?"" Deidara asked, cutting Kamiko off. ""She was Hidan""s neighbor

James croaked out. ""She""s real old friend,"" Stryker assured. Kalya stood stock still, keeping up her stone cold facade remarkably well, if it weren""t for the shimmer of wetness that Victor detected in her eyes. James stared at his lost love with his mouth partly open as the realization of this new, fresh betrayal now peirced into his heart. The blow was so devestating that James was physically forced to bend down onto his knees and let out a gasp of pain. The shock was practically suffocating him. Victor watched as the peices of James"" already bleeding heart were viciously trampled upon, leaving nothing but a broken man wheezing in its stead. Victor squatted down himself, his dark eyes watching the scene sullenly. No, this hadn""t been what he""d wanted. But there was no going back now. The damage was done. ""You really think we""d just let you walk away?"" Stryker questioned calmly, ""You""re a dangerous man. We like to keep an eye on dangerous men,"" he informed, then bringing his eyes over to Kayla, ""Tell him about the day you died,"" he commanded. There was a moment of hesitation, where Silverfox stood defiantly quiet, her heart breaking within her very chest at the sight of the man she""d once loved on his knees, suffering from such degradation. Stryker""s eyes peirced pressingly into her own, concealing a silent warning that she best do what he told her. Kalya swallowed and spoke.

""Who""s the ugly swiss cheese pony?"" Firefly asked. Queen Chrysalis glared at her. Tirek fired a bolt of fire magic. Everyone managed to leap out of the way. ""Not today, Tirek."" Twilight Sparkle growled. She put a shield in front of her allies and shot a blast of magic at the villains. Tirek defended himself.

Text2: The Titans jumped in and out of a bunch of holes, trying to catch Mad Maud. She got away, so they chased her up some stairs. The male Titans flew overhead, while the females ran on the stairs. Mad Maud unfortunately made the stairs a slide, making the Titans slip down. At the end of the staircase was some sharp jaws. Beast Babe screamed and turned into a octopus, catching Cybornetta and Robyn. Sunfire and Draven carried Beast Babe""s tentacles and dragged all three up and away. They came to a door maze. The titans ran through the doors, their sizes changing. Mad Maud kept appearing on different vehicles. The Titans, after a couple of minutes of chasing later regrouped. ""Okay team, an ambush."" Robyn told them. The Teen Titans grouped together and approached a door each. There was nothing in any of them, so the Titans approached a final door. Robyn opened it. A large dinosaur was in it. It roared, scaring Beast Babe into a little monkey and jumping into Robyn""s arms. Then the leader spotted a statue head with a crank. She turned it, and revealed... the exit. ""Wow... is that really it? The exit?"" Cybornetta gaped. The Titans walked towards it, only to fall through and realize that it was a wallpaper. The team grumbled. They were greeted by Mad Maud. ""Won""t you snotties ever learn? There""s no way out!"" the Brit jeered. Statues and lasers approached the Titans. ""Split up!"" Robyn instructed. The Titans leaped in all different directions. However, Beast Babe got herself hypnotised again. Draven had to look after her. Sunfire took flight and blasted as many statue heads as he could. ""Leave me alone, you ""jacked up"" heads! I said that right, yes?"" He asked Cybornetta, who was blasting more statues to","{""output"": ""YES""}"

It was in that instant that Carter suddenly realized what she had done; she had fled from the crash site, fled from any of the rescuers. They would assume everyone had died and would leave, and she would be stuck out here alone and left to die. ""What the hell have I done?"" Carter whispered, tears falling from her face and freezing as they fell to the ground. ""So this is the plan,"" O""Neill announced, pulling on the thick winter coat and, with difficulty due to the bulky gloves he was wearing, zipped up the parka. Within seconds he was already beginning to feel hot. ""We""re going in with the first Search and Rescue team. They have the general coordinates of where it might be. We""ll be moving hard and fast, time being of the essence.

Coming back to the present day, Jim let out a weak, ""Awesome!"" Not because he meant it, but because normal people are usually excited about winning a free trip. He gave the appropriate information to the radio station when he was transferred, and then was told he""d get an email with the flight and cruise information by the end of the day. Jim hung up the phone in a daze. They""d won? Maybe he had a career in writing crappy jingles and slogans for radio stations. Couldn""t be as boring as paper.

""Alright, I""ll do it"", he said. There wasn""t much more time for talking. Shrilly the whistle rang over the pitch. The team captains, Oliver and Professor McGonagall, shook hands, then mounted their brooms again. A second piercing blast, and Cedric Diggory released the balls.

Of course she felt safer when she had it, but he would need it more than her now. ""Can I have yours?"" she asked. ""Sure,"" he said, unbuckling his dagger belt. ""Why?"" Meg grinned at him. ""For reasons of style?"" He unfastened Adhemar""s dagger from where it was currently and hooked it to the sabre belt, then threw her the one with his own dagger. ""There you are, then.

It made his guts convulse at what could have made that usually deep but soft voice cry out so fiercely and painfully. That thing inside of Castiel, that freshly-born creature that was so irrational, so breakable and so desperate, bat against his chest and screamed all over again: ""Save Sam. Protect Sam.' Castiel flew himself over in a matter of milliseconds, tracking down the angels remarkably easy once he had traced the connection between them. He found himself in a secluded and dark alley, with dirty, abandoned apartment buildings on either side of him. He set his gaze towards the group. There were about ten of them, standing in a circle, in vessels of all shapes in sizes but wearing regular street clothes rather than the suits most of the angels were assigned to wear. Castiel could feel the reckless pulse of their graces, jubilant and completely ignorant as he walked towards them with his shoulders set back, expressing all the vicious fortitude of a lion preparing to kill its prey. He was right in his assumption: they were rebel angels. Of the younger generation, too cowardly to actually fall, but not always obedient to their father""s decrees. They were tricky, smothering their grace so that the elders couldn""t track them down. They were unlikable and dishonorable, and Castiel was honestly ashamed to call them his kin, even before he fell. But his feelings about them then were nothing compared to the fury he felt towards them now. As he approached, the laughter and the taunts began to slowly die away, realizing they had company. There was no doubt that they had heard of Castiel; his act of turning on his brothers were well known in all of

They were all laughing and having a good time, but at the same time all four of them were trying to push a looming dread out of their minds. Graduation was just weeks away. They knew, of course, that they would be friends forever. But it was still hard-for some more then others-to take that leap into the real world. They used to think at facing demonic villains and world destruction was hard. Now they had to face the real world, which was much more frightening. All of them were going to college, at what seemed to be at opposite ends of the map. Tea""s school was going to be in another country. Much to her joy, Tea won a dancing scholarship last spring in a competition, and a free ride to her dreamland: New York. She was beyond ecstatic that she was going to have a chance to live out her dream and become a professional dancer, but a part of her was resisting. The more she thought about graduation, the more she wanted things to say how they were now. It wasn""t until a month before graduation that it finally hit her: everything was going to change. No more hanging out before class, no more letting Joey copy her homework at the last minute, no more walks to school with Yugi. She was leaving behind everything, for the sake of dancing. But it was her passion, something she worked too hard to earn to turn down. And besides, she always knew they wouldn""t always be together. Just like she knew with Atem... Yugi would be going to Domino University.","{""output"": ""YES""}"

His eyes squeeze shut as she pulls, the feeling of a thousand razor blades scraping his throat raw until he can suck in a ragged breath, coughing and convulsing at the release.

Neither of them were particularly happy about Logan getting married either but as Colin was best man (something which Finn had caused quite a fuss over) and Finn did not want to be left behind, they had not been able to let their feelings take over and camp out across the road for the ceremony as Rory had. Finally Logan and Melissa emerged from the church to thunderous applause and cheers from the crowd, smiling to each other as confetti flitted down onto them and the flash of cameras went off in front of them. Logan""s arm was around his bride""s waist and even from across the street, Rory could see the twinkle of happiness in his eyes. It was not surprising, after all she knew he was happy with Melissa, she had known it the first time she had seen him in three years, the night he had shown up at her door eight months previously... ...Flashback... Rory had kissed her date goodnight at the door of her New York apartment a few minutes earlier and she was relieved to be able to kick off her sling backs and collapse on her sofa.

As at the time I made this story I have not seen the third movie, there may be some minor continuity errors. This story was actually written while listening to ""One of Us"" from the Lion King 2: Simba""s Pride soundtrack and I really think that it works well with this fan fiction. Please review as this is actually my first Star Wars story and I""d like to know everyone""s thoughts on it, good and bad. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& The desert world of Tatooine spun through space, all alone at the outer rim territories of what Emperor Palpatine had named the First Galactic Empire. The world was so barren and bereft of anything of value that, when the Sith had taken control of the galaxy, barely anything had changed on the planet surface. In fact, save for an incident involving a certain Correlian Freighter and the Imperial Navy, the inhabitants barely saw any glimmer of the Empire""s presence. This made the planet something of a haven for members of the rebellion, a fact that was not lost on Darth Vader. The Dark Lord of the Sith was currently piloting a shuttle down through the dry atmosphere of the planet, accompanied by six elite Stormtroopers. Vader trusted no one""s piloting skills but his own. As the shuttle touched down, Darth Vader reflected on why he had returned to Tatooine. It had happened only a month ago that he""d faced off against his own son, Luke Skywalker, while in Cloud City. Though he had been outmatched by the Sith Lord, the boy had shown such remarkable talent

Text2: ""Okay brat, since you cost me a rare card, I think it""s only fair that you replace it,"" Xanz said as he advanced on Mokuba. ""Why settle for one rare card when I""m offering three?"" Mokuba said as he produced all three of his brother""s Blue Eyes White Dragon cards. The rare hunter""s eyes grew wide as he imagined the reward Malik would give him for returning with such a prize. Still there had to be a catch. ""And what would I have to do to obtain those three beauties,"" Xanz asked, one of his hands moving into his pockets, fingering the small gun he kept there for emergencies. ""Does your brother know you""re here?"" ""Do you think Seto would let me be here alone?"" Mokuba said, hoping the rare hunter would misinterpret the question. Xanz looked at the three assembled dragons and knew the elder Kaiba had to be around somewhere, making sure this was all on the up and up. ""As to what you have to do, simply play a short game with me. I want you to draw three cards from your deck, any three you want. I will tell you word for word the name of the card, what it is, and a third detail you will decide. If I can""t correctly do that, you get all three of my brother""s blue eyes. But... If I succeed, you""ve got to do one thing that I want. Deal?"" ""Deal."" the Rare hunter shuffled his deck, visions of blowing away his victims with his new Blue Eyes White Dragons dancing in his head. Quickly he drew the first card as Mokuba placed as hand to his own head, closing his eyes. ""I see... The Witch of the Black Forest, an Effect Monster card.""

Iris was still in tears, but now she was bent over the body of her sister. Suddenly, there was a rush of air. The trio looked up. Dracula was standing over Iris and Sage. In a fit of rage, Iris launched herself over her sister""s body and toward the Dark Prince, beating on his chest. ""It""s your fault, you monster! If it wasn""t for you, we wouldn""t even be here!""

He leaped up from the couch, and threw open the door to the coat room under the staircase. He stepped in, shutting the door behind him. When he reemerged, he was not dressed in his ususal purple Darkwing Duck garb, but in the yellow, crimson, and black garb of his nemesis and devious double, Negaduck. He clapped a hand to his beak, trying to stiffle his giggles and rearrange his face into the most menacing one he could muster. He then made his way up the stairs toward Gosalyn""s room. No sooner had he reached the second floor landing, his daughter emerged from her room. It would have been enough...and certainly funnier for him, if Gosalyn had simply stopped at making a face. Because said face was hilarious. It was that deer-caught-in-headlights-caught-in-between-a-screech-and-shocked-silence face people often got when being pranked. But this was Gosalyn. By all rights, he should have known that his rough and tumble daughter would not take an in-home invasion by Negaduck lying down. A milisecond later, Gosalyn had wiped the look from her face and replaced it with a stern, determined look. He was sure his own face looked shocked. She lunged forward, driving her right shoulder into his abdomen. He groaned...and rolled down the stairs. ""That""ll teach you to sneak up on the Mallards!"" Gosalyn said triumphantly from the top of the stairs. ""Gos,"" Drake finally managed to gasp. ""It""s me. Your dad!"" Gos looked dubious for a moment...then her eyes widened. ""Dad?

The pokemon trainer blinked a few times before sighing and rubbing her eyes, stepping forward again. ""Ow!"" she exclaimed as she ran into something, moving her hand away from her eyes as she stumbled back, seeing she had run into someone in a black uniform with a large red R on the front.

The burly arm nearest her shifted suspiciously and she fixed Logan with a stoic glare. It stopped moving. He blew a smoke ring, put the hand that held the smoking cigar on the stump beside her. She looked down at it, looked a question at him. He nodded, most slightly. She took it from his hand and examined it, glistening end to burning end. ""Didn""t you give these up?"" she asked. ""Yep.""

Its been a few weeks since the last encounter with Grimm; every member of the lyoko gang is terrified at the thought of Grimm becoming stronger. XANA has moved in with Ashley and Brandon since the factory is no longer safe. Ashley was in the kitchen making dinner while Brandon was out in the backyard staring at the night sky. ""Why... No matter what I do he continues to win..why?"" Brandon said to himself. A cool Breeze swept by and Mya walked over to Brandon and laid next to him. Brandon continued to watch the night sky very deep in thought. Mya whined a little and Brandonlooked down at her. ""Hey girl"" Brandon said placing his hand on her head and rubbing the back of her neck. ""Brandon dinner is ready"" Ashley said. ""I""ll be there in a minute"" Brandon said. Brandon began to wonder if he would ever defeat Grimm. Grimm had broken Brandon""s shoulder in their last fight the doctor had told Brandon that the injury was permanent; Brandon would never be able to use his left arm again. Brandon got up and headed inside Mya following him. Brandon tried to take his mind off of Grimm, but he couldn""t stop thinking about what would happen next time. Brandon decided to go ahead and try to sleep. ""Brandon are you okay?"" Ashley asked. ""I""m not sure"" Brandon replied in a gloomy tone. Brandon tried to figure out a way to battle Grimm with his arm messed up, but

After two minutes, The red echidna crashed in just like if he seen a ghost and shouted insanely ""He""s back"" and the fox and pink hedgehog couldn""t believe it.

She couldn""t even imagine how she would feel in Sango""s place. Not able to remember anyone...her family, her friends, her past; it certainly didn""t help that almost everyone she had know was dead. But that was another thing; she didn""t remember her family...so there was no way that she could remember the revenge she had claimed on their behalf. Sango had had such a hard life, at least in the short time before they had become friends. Perhaps it was for the best that she had forgotten so much... At least for now. ""Wh-where...""

Text2: Now he was ticked. He shifted, dropping the throttle and sped up right on her tail. Gravity and force pushing him back. He could feel the pull in his chest, the exhilaration of adrenaline as it coursed through him. They were coming up on the crest of a hill along a deserted stretch of road running between some horse farms. The mares were out in the field huddled together in the last of the afternoon sun. He swung up along side of her, inched ahead and glanced at her. She leaned forward crouching low over her machine. Kicking it into high gear, she catapulted ahead of him, somewhere close to a hundred miles an hour. House did the same trying to catch her but her bike was too fast and a car was coming in the opposite direction. He bolted into the right lane and slowed his speed. Damn it. All he could see was her taillights in the distance. Fuck. He""d lost her. Slowing back down a bit, he punched at the tank between his legs. Anger and disappointment coursed through him erasing the flash of adrenaline that had been racing in him. Fuck. House followed the road, riding out the rest of his anger. By the time his fury had dissipated, he came up into parking lot of a bar. He pulled into a spot and took off his helmet. He rested it against his thigh. And then he saw her. She dismounted her bike with a catlike grace swinging her leg over the edge. Standing, she turned to look at him. In slow motion, like a rock video, she took of her helmet and shook out her hair. The dark, fiery mass of curls swung and bounced gleaming in the setting sunlight like a torch. Her hair","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Probably though Gabriel was an idiot for getting himself mixed up in this death-game for the sake of saving his two younger brothers from almost certain and inevitable death. ""You idiot!""

I ran back into the bathroom filled a large bowl full of warm water and grabbed a sponge. I took a seat beside her on her bed. I felt like crying at how helpless she looked knowing it was my fault. Her skirt was covering most of her torso and came up to her ribs. I looked in her drawers (which I will probably get scolded for later) and pulled out a pair of sleep shorts that I could change her into. Okay she will probably make another pass at my sexuality when she finds out I changes her. I pulled her skirt off gently, sure not to hurt her anymore than I already have. Brilliant she just had to wear a thong. I averted my eyes because it was wrong to look with her in this condition. I quickly slipped her shorts on. I dripped the sponge into the warm water and squeezed it so it was just damp enough. I brushed a piece of hair on her face behind her ear and starting dabbing and rubbing away the dried blood around her nose and lips.

He looked up and noted the crescent shape of the moon, and knew immediately that if this was a werewolf it would be part of the legendary pack. No other werewolves could turn outside the full moon. And then he saw it, running across the lawn, creating a perimeter around the house. It was a white gold wolf, and despite its size Klaus recognized it for a pup. The wolf, with its glowing coat, was menacing under the moonlight. Klaus looked out towards the street and found four young men circling the house, reluctant to come closer as the wolf guarded the property. Klaus allowed his Hybrid to emerge, transitioning easily to a yellow-eyed vampire and baring his fangs. He sped towards one and brought him down by snapping his neck. Klaus flashed to another and bit, drawing the blood until his heart stopped. He saw the golden wolf pup pause in his rounds, then start chasing after one. Klaus took on the fourth and dispensed of him as easily. While the wolf pup chased the werewolf in its human form, Klaus watched with pride. He watched as the wolf leapt into the air beautifully and land on the back of the intruder, then bring the man down to the ground. Klaus stopped before the wolf and stroked the golden fur. ""Good boy,"" he murmured gently. ""Now go home."" The golden wolf sprinted away from Klaus. ""You didn""t really think I would let an innocent kid have such a worthless first kill, did you?""

Text2: is the king?"" the knight asked without hesitation as he hopped down off his horse. ""I believe his majesty is in his study,"" replied one of the knights standing guard. Without another word the knight took off running down the castle halls. Within the safety of the castle, the storm was but a distant memory. The thick stone walls drowned out most of the noise from the storm, enough so that the knight could even hear the crackling of the torches lining the hallways. Surprisingly, the baby in his arms was silent, and worrying for the child""s life the knight quickly unwrapped him from the bundle. He breathed a sigh of relief upon finding the baby simply sleeping soundly. It didn""t take long for the knight to maneuver his way through the numerous castle passageways. While on normal nights, even at this late hour, people would be bustling about, during storms people tended to sit back and relax. When the knight reached the king""s study, he neither hesitated nor knocked, rather simply barging into the room. ""Your majesty,"" the knight quickly began as he entered the room, ""please forgive the intrusion, but I bring word from the Eastern Provinces."" The king""s study was a modestly sized room. Finely crafted cherry wood bookcases crammed full of books on a variety of subjects lined the walls. In one corner rested a beautifully wrought red oak desk with a matching satin-cushioned chair. On the far wall a large fire crackled in the fireplace, a Hylian Shield with two swords crossed diagonally behind it hanging above the mantel. Before the fireplace were two more of the satin cushioned chairs, in one of which sat King Hyrule reading a book.

Arthur asked instead. ""No,"" Merlin said, his mouth curving into an odd little smile. ""My father was a Dragonlord, not a sorcerer. And I never learned magic, I was born with it. It was a... unusual gift to be born with, but there was nothing I could do about it growing up."" ""That""s not possible,"" Arthur accused, furrowing his brow. ""Sorcerers aren""t born with magic.""

Yamazaki looked up at his reflection in the mirror, almost recoiling away in shock at the black, unhappy clown face that was staring at him. Almost instantly, though, he relaxed. The face was his, after all. Another shout came from the school theatre front, demanding angrily, impatiently, for the narrator""s appearance. He glanced to the curtain, then picked up the other mask and quickly stepped into the darkness. He blinked rapidly at the spotlight that shone on him, silently cursing Syaoran who was running the lighting systems, then he swiftly shielded his made up face with the smiling mask. Through the slits he could see the audience, which only consisted of the teacher-in-charge and the ever-so-jubilant scriptwriter (*). Taking a practiced breath, he began to speak. ""Good evening, my friends! Welcome to the Tavern House, a place where you can eat, drink..."" The words flowed from his glib tongue like water, any hint of nervousness vanishing like darkness before light, and he threw himself into the part of Chimera, the two-faced clown cum narrator of the customized story: Between Reality and Fantasy. He would gleefully mock the audience with the happy mask, acting as Chimera the glad and the ignorant, while nearing the real first act of the play he switched to Chimera the sorrow-filled and the wise with his own painted face, taunting the audience with heavy sarcasm and a thought-provoking mini-speech.

Even though much later Zexion occasionally just sits with him and doesn""t say anything, he doesn""t think much of it, although he enjoys what little conversation they had.

Text2: I started this so long ago that I didn""t even know if I was gonna finish it, despite how short it is. But we started short stories in English, so I figured I could finish it and use it if we had to write one. And thus, I actually got motivation to dust off the Microsoft Word document and open it. Anyway, this one-shot is for the cliche idea that if Koichi actually died in episode 50, Koji""d be completely broken and stuff. The reason I actually started it was because I got inspiration from the song Just To Get High by Nickelback. It just seemed to really fit the situation and it seemed like it""d be Takuya""s POV and talking about Koji. To better understand this story and where I got some of the parts, I""d definitely recommend listening to this song. The kind of relationships in here aren""t shonen-ai. For example, Koji""s depressed-ness for Koichi""s death isn""t KouKou, and Takuya""s caring for Koji isn""t Takouji. Just lots of family-based love. This is solely anime-based, so my Frontier OC Mirai isn""t in this. If that""s a disappointment to anyone, I apologize. But this is probably a work of my angsty side again, as is most of my Frontier writings. But all of that aside, I hope you enjoy this! Just To Get High It hadn""t been all that long ago, less time than had truly passed. How life had completely changed around. Things had been so much better before it happened; those current trivialities seemed like nothing compared to now.

He called to seemingly no one in particular. Just as the group was going to ask him who he was talking to, a small pokemon emerged from the trees above and landed on his shoulder. It was similar to Scatterbug, but this time it was green instead of black, and it""s pupils were a normal round instead of square. It had an abdomen as well, with similar stubby legs, and a pink, Y shaped arch. ""This is Caterpie, a good friend of mine,"" Steven introduced. Caterpie looked at them for a moment before giving a happy moan. Shauna then walked up to it and began petting it, in which it gave an approved moan, even louder and cuter than before.

It was quite the cynical comment, and she didn""t know how to counter it, this halt temporarily putting the heated word battle into pause. She really wished that she could be as good at talking as she was fighting. Why did it have to be so hard? What was he doing before she came? A random question, but now that they were at a standstill, she was curious. Leaning to the right past his figure, she noticed a few items littered next to a fairly flat rock. Let""s see: a cloth, a bottle of oil, and wax. Was he...? ""Were you polishing Crocea Mors?"" He appeared surprised at the change of topic, and glanced behind him at the cleaning tools.

He didn""t know where the fuck his guard had gone, but if he could hold out until breakfast, then Selene would discover him. That was what he was counting on right now anyway. He""d long ago lost the energy to stand. He""d dunked his blanket in his water-bucket and used it to cover his head from the air in his room.

""Have a nice nap?"" I heard a voice ask. ""Yeah..."" I replied, yawning. ""Did you, now?"" ""Uh huh..."" I nodded. ""Good. Now, would you like to explain why you and Jasper were fighting this morning?"" When I heard that question my eyes focused on Principal Lilly and Nurse Jazmen. They both looked irritated, their arms were crossed and I heard the faint noise of a foot tapping. My mind started to clear up as I observed my surroundings. I was in the school hospital... again. ""Wha""s going on?"" I slurred. ""You had a fight with a student named Jasper this morning. We had to sedate both of you in order to prevent serious injuries,"" Principal Lilly

It startled her enough to send her jumping back from him like his skin was the fire that consumed her. He too, seemed to gather some sense of decorum and brushed at his suit jacket idly, as if he hadn""t been up to anything at all. ""Next time maybe we should cut you off earlier."" He cleared his throat and suggested. ""9!"" ""I don""t think that""s necessary. I""m feeling pretty sober at the moment.""

The letters tumbled from her lips quickly and effortlessly. ""1!"" She looked around and noticed it had begun. Everywhere she looked someone was kissing someone else. Toasting each other then kissing, or kissing then toasting. Or- He grabbed her face and placed his lips against the corner of her mouth. She froze and before she knew it he was pulling away.

""Oooh what I would give to just..."" she said waving her hands. Cole watched as she bent over and picked up the bucket. ""...agh...and I thought owning a club and saving the world once a week was hard."" She said. That sounded a lot like... ""Piper?"" he asked as he took the bucket away from her.

It could be some demon she was sent here to vanquish. ""Have you seen Phoebe?"" he asked urgently ignoring her question. ""Cole?"" she asked with a laugh. ""Yes. Have you seen Phoebe?"" he repeated. She continued to laugh. ""What?"" he asked impatiently. ""Nothing."" She answered back stopping her laughter. ""Its just I never thought I""d see you dressed...well...like that."" She said trying to conceal a smile. ""You should look in a mirror then."" He shot back. ""Now have you seen Phoebe?"" ""No. No I haven""t or Leo or Prue. No powers either.""

Flicking the three switches above her head, she leaned back in her seat, laced her fingers behind her head, and beamed. Leaf on the wind. ""And this leaf is feeling hungry,"" she said, rubbing her stomach before giving it a gentle pat. Standing up, she nearly tripped on her way out, as if her feet belonged to someone else. Gliding into the kitchen, she grabbed the nearest protein and began to eat. ""Hey, big guy,"" she greeted Jayne with an eerie smirk. ""Uh, hey,"" he responded, looking down at his arsenal of weapons.

Before Alaric could fire of what was sure to be a witty, biting retort - trust him, really - Damon sealed their lips together. And just when Alaric got his arms around the smaller man""s hips, ready to make the most of this supposedly-fortunate change of plans- A throat cleared. Alaric broke the kiss, and Damon let out a curse under his breath before donning a smile and turning around to face the newcomers. Stefan, Elena, and Bonnie were standing just a few meters away at the entrance to the graveyard, all with various expressions. Stefan looked exasperated, Elena looked a little bit embarrassed, and Bonnie just looked amused. Damon, on the other hand, looked mildly annoyed. ""Funny, I was just asking Ric where the cock-block cadets had gotten off to. Wasn""t I, Ric?"" Alaric put a hand on Damon""s shoulder, not quite restrictively, just enough to tell him to tone it back. ""Damon, play nice."" Damon glanced back at him, rolling his eyes.

Charles deserved better than this, better than them! With Charles""s hands at bay, he turned his attentions to the missiles. If he could just do this one thing, then it would be over. If he could just wipe these people out, then he could make Charles understand. These people wanted to kill him, and Erik couldn""t let that happen!

He noticed, then, that Charles had stopped fighting against him, and turned to see him with his hand stretched, palm out, towards Erik""s helmet. It startled him - both his lapse in judgment and Charles""s near victory - and instinct caught on before thought could. With one hand, he pushed Charles""s arm to the side, and with the other, he drove a punch into the side of Charles""s face that was hard enough to smack his head to the ground. More missiles exploded with Erik""s distraction, but Charles wasn""t fighting anymore. The blow had stunned him, and Erik seized the opportunity to regain control over the missiles.

The taste was bitter, but it wasn""t the first time he had drank tequila, so he was prepared. Magnus was beaming. He drank his shot as well, looking far too pleased with himself. Alec wondered if he had been lying about the alcohol tolerance thing. ""So you""re a Shadowhunter,"" Magnus said pensively as he poured the second round of shots. ""Killed many demons?""

Miroku honestly didn""t know how long he could last. He too had had a dose of the demon""s poison, and while he wasn""t as badly injured as Sango, he was still in rough condition. Miroku glanced up when the moon was one-quarter risen. He had been looking at the ground, watching his way so as not to stumble and injure Sango and himself more. There! The moonlight shone on a tiny hut with thatched roof and a large garden. Miroku sighed happily and quickly picked his way over to the hut. To all appearances it was deserted. He shouldered his way into the hut, since the door was unlocked, and called out. ""Hello? Is anyone here?"" Not hearing an answer, Miroku decided that he would set Sango down now and stay awake until the owner of the hut came back. Surely they would understand, thought Miroku, that he had done what was proper under the circumstances, as one of his friends was hurt. The hut was not totally dark. A small fire, much larger at one point in time, still burned in the surprisingly large hearth. A dark pot still hung over the pot. Finding some firewood handy, Miroku tossed some logs in and watched as the fire roared into sudden life. The hut was sparsely furnished, divided into two parts: the living area and the sleeping area. The entire setup was only three rooms, including a kitchen. Miroku thought, as he searched for some blankets, that whoever lived in the hut must have been moderately poor. He couldn""t find any blankets, but he couldn""t waste more time looking for them. He took

He came back to normal when this didn""t work and rapped smartly on Robin""s head. ""Is there a doctor in the house?"" Robin snapped out of his reverie as Beast Boy chuckled at his own joke. ""Yeah...sorry,"" Robin said, forcibly pulling his mind away from Raven. Why did she have such a hold on him? But something she had said came back to him now...their first meeting. She knew Beast Boy. Robin grinned. Perhaps Beast Boy could pull something out of the cold girl. ""Beast Boy,"" Robin announced, getting up suddenly, ""we are taking a field trip."" ""Woo-hoo,"" the boy replied sarcastically. ""You gonna show me Arkham again? ""Cuz dude, that place scared the crap outta me."" ""Nope.

Especially not an inmate and a visiting patient. But Robin shrugged off his slight sense of guilt, arguing to himself that not only would nobody see, but that it was for the greater good of both Raven and Beast Boy.

From their position and posture, Clint couldn""t tell what gender they were, but after ten minutes of watching, scratched them off his internal ""potential threat"" list. At barely five minutes until the meeting began, Clint made his way to the pavilion from one of the shade trees. He doesn""t have his bow, too obvious, but was heavily armed never-the-less. At the central table under the steel cover sat a middle aged man in an ill fitting pin striped suit. At the corners to the pavilion stood hulking brutes in leather jackets that didn""t really conceal the fact that they were all wearing shoulder harnesses with weapons loaded within. Clint nearly rolled his eyes at the cliché they made, but resolutely did not, keeping his sharp gaze forward, and face impassive as he moved into close range. He stopped at the edge of the concrete pad and waited. ""Mr. Weller,"" the headman spoke, sounding like he had a pack a day habit, and gargled rocks with his coffee. ""Mr. Clarkson,"" Clint responded. The man waved him forward. Clint thought Clarkson was stupid for letting him cross into this temporary zone, without checking for weapons, but he thrived on others"" stupidity.

Cato""s father, Herminius, saw Priscus hastily grabbing a brass goblet and some wine into it and, suspecting something, started approaching Priscus to confront him. Nebi simply leaned casually on a wall close to the front door, observing the party the Romans were having, muttering to himself; ""My mother once described the upper class Egyptians having festivities like this.. and here I always thought we Egyptians had nothing in common with them.."" He saw Cato walking toward him, Cato curiously asked, ""Seen anything yet?"" ""You mean aside from some of the party guests, along with the host, getting pathetically drunk from all that wine?""

Cato asked, questioning his new friend""s cynicism.

He""s only going to attend the finals of the talent show - where the top two finalists will compete against each other to win. Until then, the list of names is kept confidential. He won""t know who entered, until the night of the finals."" ""So,","{""output"": ""NO""}"
998,"Text1: Phoebe blinked. How could Leo hate his own son? What was he, a homophobe in the future? Why should Wyatt being gay be that big of a thing in the future? Or maybe Phoebe just didn""t get it, like with most things. ""No, Chris. I don""t hate you or Wyatt. Sexuality shouldn""t matter when it comes to love. Hell, I married a demon, Chris. I guess weird relationships run in the family. Why are you still so afraid that Leo will hate you or Wyatt?"" The Charmed One was still confused as to what was the matter with Chris and why Leo got so pissed when he found out in the future. So Phoebe reached out her hand to touch Chris. Maybe she could induce a premonition that would tell her why Leo hated it so much. Chris pulled back. ""What the hell are you doing? Trying to fondle me or something? I know you""re a skank, but geez."" Phoebe glared hotly at Chris. ""What do you mean I""m a skank? I have not slept with that many guys! How many guys have YOU slept with? And no, I was only trying to brush a fuzzy off of your shirt."" Phoebe was a really bad liar, but Chris seemed to buy it. He rolled his eyes but let her get ""the fuzzy"". Phoebe gasped as she was pulled into a premonition that she herself had induced. Premontion Leo was yelling at a well-built teenager, around 18, with curly blonde hair. He looked incredibly pissed off. The young man, Phoebe guessed it was the Future version of Wyatt, was shaking his head. ""You don""t understand, Dad. I love Chris. I want to be with him. I don""t care what you say. Its ""forbidden"" and ""wrong""? So was your relationship with Mom!

Dean and Rachel glared at each other for a few more minutes until Sam finally came back downstairs, Loki following, interrupting their glaring contest. Loki was being surprisingly serious about this for once. He hadn""t made any rude remarks, other than that first sarcastic comment to Bobby. Loki laid a book on the small table in the center of them. ""I know her of old, as I said, but she was a goddess of death. I mean, DEATH. My uh, my daughter, she""s a goddess of death too, but she""s much more powerful. She still has a whole damned realm of the dead she rules over. Not even Death himself challenges her. I have to wonder...why is Morri so weak? And why am I, and my children, still powerful?"" Loki looked thoughtful, he chewed his lip a bit. ""Pagan gods like us, we...well, we""re supposed to require worshipers to remain as powerful as I am. People still worship Loki, that is, me, but I don""t...well, FEEL anything. No extra power, no weakening power...maybe something else is wrong with Morri."" Sam and the others did not respond to this. The reason he didn""t require worshipers was because he wasn""t Loki, he was Gabriel, the archangel. Angels didn""t require worship. As for Loki""s daughter and other children (for some reason, that bothered Sam, the thought of Loki fucking anyone but him), they likely didn""t lose power because their father was one of the four most powerful archangels, well, ever. Gabriel was the only archangel to have ever fathered children (Castiel had confirmed this, as well as Rachel), so information on that matter was","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Marty: (He finds the picture that they brought from 1955.) I""m sure am going to miss him, Annie. Annie: Me too, Marty. (Just then, the alarms sound and the gates go down. They turn to look down the tracks but see no train coming.) Both: What the hell? (At that moment, three sonic booms forced them back and a train appears. They both get up and see Doc behind the train""s wheel.) Doc? Doc: Marty, Annie! It runs on steam! (The doors open. Clara comes over.) Meet the family. Clara, you two know. Clara: Hello, Marty and Annie! Both: (They wave.) Ma""am! Doc: And these are our boys. (A boy about nine with short brown hair and brown eyes comes over.) Jules. (Another boy about seven with short blonde hair and green eyes comes over as well.) And Verne. Boys, this is Marty and Annie. (Both boys wave.)

And I didn""t want to leave Einstein and I didn""t want you two to be worried about me. (Clara hands him a wrapped present.) Oh and this is for you two.

Text2: With a sizzle, Timmy had got armor and powers like Turbo Thunder""s. Marty said, ""Looking good."" Trixie added, ""I""ll say."" Timmy blushed and I saw that we still had some time. I chanted, ""The powers of the islands have chosen you to protect and serve our world. For you have courage, strength, and bravery. God, protect these heroes may they watch over us all!"" Trixie, A. J., Chester, Timmy, Marty, Doctor Brown, and Annie all glow a white light. Jorgen asked, ""Nance, what was that all about?"" I told him, ""I activated their island magic. They""re all magical beings."" Annie responded, ""Again, this is bitching!"" The Destructiontator turned to the four points of light. Timmy mocked, ""You know, for a guy that was supposed to ""eliminate"" us, you""re not doing a very good job."" The Destructiontator told them, ""You four are so going down."" Chester responded, ""Actually, we""re going up!"" With that, the four of them blasted off into space. I turned to Turbo and asked, ""Turbo, what""s going on?"" October 23, 2002 10:15 a.m. Space/North Pole Timmy""s POV A. J., Chester, Trixie, and I were keeping ahead of the Destructiontator pretty good even though I had just gotten dubbed ""Turbo Timmy"". I turned to my friends and saw that they were keeping up with me pretty good. I still couldn""t believe that they were here with me. I was glad. I didn""t want to face the Destructiontator and the Darkness alone. And it felt good including my Uncle Emmet, Marty, and Annie into this. Though, I couldn""t help wonder what ""protection"" Nance gave us. Chester mocked, ""Give up, Destructiontator!"" Trixie added, ""Yeah, because you can""t catch the four points of light!"" Just then, we crashed into Destructiontator. Without anyone looking, I took the detonator. A. J. commented, ""What do","{""output"": ""YES""}"
