I watched as Soma charged in and realized that his sword bends and that there were only certain ways to earn points in fencing, leaving him to dodge Ciel""s onslaught of jabs and thrusts. Ciel started kind of explaining that the sword was used for those kinds of moves, but he took his chance at trying to jab Soma in the torso, only for Agni to get between them and jab a finger into Ciel""s pressure point. Agni panicked. ""C-Ciel, sir! My deepest apologies! My body moved on its own when I thought the prince was going to lose!"" Sebastian went over to see if Ciel was okay, but there wasn""t much he could do and I headed over. ""Your best bet is to massage the area around the pressure point to try and ease up the muscles there."" I muttered quietly, taking Ciel""s arm and beginning to do just that as Soma praised Agni. ""Ahaha, Agni! You have protected a master like me really well! I praise you! Agni is my butler, he""s all mine! In other words, I won!"" ""Tha-"" ""Now you shall play with me!"" Soma cut Ciel off, but Lau didn""t seem to be enjoying himself much and tossed the sword he had at Sebastian, who caught it. ""Here, you should take reprisal for your master, butler."" ""What are you going to do, Ciel""s butler?"" Soma questioned as Ciel frowned, allowing me to continue massaging his arm since it seemed to be helping a little. ""Indeed..."" Sebastian said, sighing. ""It""s because you were being mean to a novice who didn""t know the rules."" ""Wha?!"" ""However, when the master is injured like this..."" Sebastian stood from his place beside Ciel. ""As a butler of the Phantomhive family, I can""t ignore it. Moreover,

""Let""s take the same electives!"" ""We""re in the same class, after all."" They chimed, smirking over at Tamaki as they brought out the list for Haruhi to look over.

While walking through the empty second floor - the library was closing soon most people had already left - I heard a muffled thump. I headed towards the sound - I should of known better. I mean, it could of been anything, but Father Dom had just warned me that my life might be endangered by some mediator-killer, so I had no excuse to be as careless as I was being - and found myself in front of a door that had ""Video Room"" written on a plaque hanging on the door. I quietly turned the handle and opened the door. As soon as I saw that the room was total darkness I placed my hand on the wall to my right looking for the light switch. I gasped as I saw who was in the room. A young woman a bit older than me was lying on the floor, her only wound was two tiny pinpricks on her neck. Beside stood a surprised looking Set with blood dripping off two long canine teeth extending from his mouth. Author""s Note: The whole vampire thing has nothing to do with Ninth Key, it""s just that I love - as in a kind of obsessed way, but also in a good way - vampires. And yes, Set is a real vampire, not the kind of vampire-wannabe Red Beaumont was.

""Mulder, we""re nearly out of gas. We have to stop at a gas station."" Scully instructed to Mulder, who was focused on the road in front of them. In about half an hour, as if on cue, the tank empties and the getaway car pulls to a stop. Scully sighed ""Great."" and pulled herself out of the car to have a look around. Nothing, she couldn""t see anything but trees and empty roads. ""Now what?"" she asked slightly angry to Mulder who had by now got out of the vehicle and stood by her side, joining her in her walk down the road.

The sun wasn""t so bright any more, but it was still shining relentlessly in their eyes, casting the building into shadow. In the road, Scully saw something, another shadow in the road. ""What is that?"" she asked Mulder who had now fixed his eyes on the small shadow just a little outside the building as well. They could see the building clearly now. It indeed looked like a service station. It looked like it was operative, all the gas tanks were clean and the building was","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Once he got there, he began sorting papers. Annie stood, stiff as a board, in the middle of the huge room. She didn""t dare speak before he did. ""Do you know why you""re here, Miss Cresta?"" Snow asked softly once he seemed satisfied with the way his desk was arranged. Annie forced herself to speak in a steady voice. ""I can""t say I do, sir."" The ghost of a grin flitted across Snow""s face. ""We seem to have a bit of a dilemma on our hands."" ""We do?"" Annie said. ""Yes."" Snow put both hands on his desk, leaning forward slightly. ""Your dear Mr. Odair has made a rather unfortunate mistake. You see, he was scheduled for an appointment with one of my highest paying clients last night, and it seemed to have...slipped his mind."" He stared very intently at Annie, who felt quite strongly that she was missing something. After a split second of deliberation, Annie decided not to start asking questions right away. ""D-did he? I""m...sure he didn""t mean to."" The response sounded pathetic, even to her. Snow laughed under his breath. ""I think you and I both know very well that that""s not the point, Miss Cresta,"" he said. ""I""m sure you know what""s at stake here. I suppose I should ask: would you like to share Mr. Odair""s workload with him?"" Annie couldn""t skate through that one. ""I""m sorry, sir, but I""m afraid I don""t know what you""re referring to.""

But I just pushed it away, as I realized it would never happen between us. I""m not like the sweetest girl and far from the prettiest. I""m random sized. Always wear my hair in a slobby braid. And my clothing is just always the same. Little leather boots. Just some shabby pants and a way to big tee. ""Peeta.' I almost sighed cause of stress.

That""s just they""re stupid name for me."" He says lifting his head proudly when he says the word Andrew. He looks at me, waiting for me to reply. Wow he""s really smart. I clear my throat, ""Well Andrew you are the smartest...ummm, living creature I""ve ever had the pleasure to talk with."" I say extending out my hand for him to shake it. His eyes softened even further. He brought his paw to my hand and shook it, his fur was soft and had little gray patches. Probably from aging.

She wore a long white dress and she was always bare foot. She was kind of not what you would normally expect a god to be. In fact Natsu claims that he knew a few yokais which were better meant to be god than her. ""Ice-block! Stop your girlfriend before everything is set underwater!"" Natsu yelled loudly as he pointed at Juvia while glaring at Gray. It was getting chaotic but it would always get that way if the yokais showed up in our house and these were only three and the god who would randomly show up here, there were a lot more. I don""t know when but my live had stopped being normal a long time ago and now I was living with surprises and problems normal people wouldn""t have to deal with. Yep my live was beyond normal but I was still happy. Maybe that was because I wanted to see what the future was holding up for me and Natsu or that it was impossible for live to get boring with the yokais around.

The rebels blew our doors out and then took a grip on our shoulders. We began to run towards a door, when an enormous posse of Peacekeepers emerged from it. Some orders were shouted out loud and all the rebel soldiers took their assigned place in the well-trained group formation. Guns were fired, but we made our exit in less than 10 minutes. We embarked on a hovercraft that was directed towards District 13. I began to scream, to roar and to gesture before I felt a needle puncture mu arm. Someone gave me some sedative in order to calm me down. They then put me into restraints so that I couldn""t do any harm. After a fly of nearly 3 hours, we landed in the indoor hangar, situated well below ground zero. Some nurses entered in the hangar and brought us three prisoners into the hospital. It was impressive how a whole District had been built in a subterranean environment. Their air was conducted by numerous pipes all punctured very carefully to let the right amount of O2 go out in order to be breathed. While we were directed, I was looking everywhere trying to understand the intricate design that managed to have such a great population living here. Also, I noticed that people were staring at me as if they thought I was their savior. Some others did so with a look of embarrassment as if I did not look right; as if I had gone mad. We finally entered the medical center. I was brought to a room and the nurse who accompanied me told me to lie

""Why does this keep happening to me?' She didn""t understand. She moved to sit on the edge of the bed, and put her head in her hands, before running her fingers through her hair. Reyes"" skin was clammy and she was dehydrated. Standing, she went and got a drink of water from the bathroom sink, splashing her face. Almost as soon as she willed the phone to ring it did, and she walked across the room to pick it up. ""Monica Reyes,"" she answered, rather professionally for two in the morning. ""What on earth are you doing awake?"" John asked over the line. ""The phone woke me up,"" she stated obviously. ""No way Reyes, I know your voice when you""re awake."" He sighed.

He wasn""t looking forward to returning home that night, knowing he""d have to punish her in order to maintain the control he had over the household.

I feel like a little girl again, joining my father on a hunting trip. I walk to the tree where I hide my bow and arrows. My fingers wrap themselves around my bow, and something inside me sparks.

The Canadian""s eyes widened as Jason suddenly lurched to the side. The astronaut cried out in fear, flailing his arms as he tried to regain his balance. Mitch reached out to grab him, but pulled back as he felt himself begin to lose balance. He could only watch and Jason""s book fell off him. The water fell to the ground, along with the blue astronaut. Jason hit the ground, his suit absorbing most of the impact. He groaned, rolling onto his back and staring up at the sky. He froze as he saw Mitch standing multiple feet above him and jumped up, turning to face Dan. The warden was standing next to him, holding his baton out like a spear. Mufflebuns got an evil grin on his face and twirled the baton jokingly. Jason stumbled backwards, hitting his chair tower. The chairs bent to the side, nearly crashing into Mitch""s tower. The Benja watched from below as Jason and Dan began a game of cat and mouse. They ran laps around the courtyard, eventually maneuvering their way into the gym equipment. Jason ducked under a punching bag, stopping for a moment to hit it in Mufflebun""s direction. The warden cried out, glaring as the punching bag hit him in the face.

Mary-Lynnette licked her ice cream cone as they walked through the large building filled with tons of small booths from various stores, swinging the hand that Ash was holding. She was looking at a gold chain necklace when she noticed the sign saying, ""Face Paint!' outside of the building. With a giggle she pulled Ash over to it and looked at all the things she could get painted on her cheek. ""What would you like?"" asked the man who was going to do her face paint. ""Could I get the letter A in a heart?"" Mare asked, ignoring Ash""s laughter when he heard. The man nodded before starting the design. When he finished Mare""s left cheek had a pink heart with a black letter A in the center. ""Does your boyfriend want anything?"" the man asked as Mare stood up. ""Oh yes he does,"" Mare laughed having the perfect plan as she shoved Ash into the seat, ""Could you draw a cat face on him?"" The man laughed","{""output"": ""YES""}"

They were now re-emerging unbidden, the memories he thought he had destroyed before he walked down this path. She, on the other hand, wasn""t shocked by his appearance. She knew how he looked like after all these years. She had his wanted poster framed in her private room after all. Miwa silently cursed Kamui but she knew it was her fault. She never really gave a damn about names, especially of men who comes down to Yoshiwara for her. She knew better than to get attached to them. She had seen too many women ruin themselves for men who give them even a sliver of hope for a life outside this hell-hole. It""s better not knowing anything about such men. But damn, she should have known better than to blindly obey Kamui. She shouldn""t have let Takasugi see her this way. What she had to stoop to in order to survive. In order to be able to wait, and wait and wait. ""Shinsuke-sama will wipe the floor with your face, bitch!"" Makoto called over the din of noise. Her two companions, however, also saw Takasugi""s initial reaction upon seeing the woman and thought better than to say anything at the moment. Whatever""s about to happen will be a first for them. They could already guess that the woman and Takasugi had a past, but what exactly? He seemed to hate anything concerning his past, like his two Ex-Joui comrades they had plenty of run-ins with. Kamui observed the two samurai at hand. He wanted to fight them both but they were both quite valuable to certain groups of people. He""s not really afraid to

Chad crafted a bow for Alaya and showed her how to use it. He put his hands on hers and showed her how to hold it, pull back, and release. ""It""s better then a sword because you can use it from farther away from your target,"" Chad commented. They sat in the tops of the trees and looked at the forest ground below. When animals passed, they shot their arrows and collected the meat, feathers, leather, and wool. By the end of the day their inventory was full with items. Alaya expanded the house and Chad started a small farm of wheat, sugar cane, melons, and pumpkins. A furnace was built to cook their food. Chad was tending to the farm when he saw a sign. Neither one of them had placed it there. On it read: ""Greetings, Alaya and Chad.You must be wondering why you were brought here. The world of Minecraftia needs you. The inhabitants here are being threatened by an evil being, Him. The two of you are some of the best players of this game. You are the only ones who can stop Him. Best of luck to you!"" He brought Alaya out and showed her the message. Neither could believe what it said. It was getting dark so they called it a day. ""Who do you think He is?"" Alaya asked while lying in her bed. ""Probably another player that feels like being a jerk,"" Chad casually said. ""Maybe,"" she replied faintly. Alaya fell asleep in a matter of seconds, but Chad stayed up for a while.

It didn""t use to be like this, she thought, washing potatoes now; she could remember when she had constant company- constant affection... (""I want to leave you, Antonio."") It wasn""t that she had been unhappy when she was with Antonio, because she had been- she had been for a long time. Antonio was kind and optimistic and passionate even when life got hard. When Amihan had first moved to England to live with her grandparents in Primary School she had spoken very little English- only Spanish and Tagalog- and had not been able to make very many friends. It was then that she had met him, Antonio, a boy who spoke in a tongue that she could understand, and he took it upon himself to teach her all of the things she didn""t know. Soon enough he began to dote on her. It seemed natural enough that even after she had begun to fit in with her peers she stayed with Antonio. By then they had became close friends and she didn""t really even see the point in straying from him- all of the friends she had made were friends she knew through him, and she still found herself too shy to venture out and make new ones. It seemed even more natural that, upon her second year of knowing him, they began to date. Dating him was simple; any pre-pubescent awkwardness she had been told to expect did not apply to their relationship. It was not as if they did not spend all of their time together already. And it was not as if they ever did anything so affectionate as kiss in public. To Amihan... dating him was something that was unavoidable, as if it had

""Molly!"" he yelled suddenly scared for her welfare, he didn""t like the sound of it and ran as fast as his legs could carry him towards her. Bursting though the heavy undergrowth, Aikka paused a split second, taking in the scene with amazing clarity. Molly, he saw was sitting up, panting heavily while pressing herself as close to one of the trees as possible. In front of her was a large animal intent on making her its next meal. His mind working furiously, Aikka jumped in front of Molly and finally saw what the animal was. It was a giant car like creature. It had its fangs and teeth pointed straight at him. Aikka immediately notched an arrow into his bow. Just as the animal pounced, Aikka released his arrow, it hit the creature head on, killing it instantly. Aikka returned his bow to where it belonged, before turning to face Molly who was standing up against the tree. They

They charged at each other and started a fierce sword fight. The Titans watched as the pair fought, handling the blades expertly. They watched as both inflicted various wounds on each other. They kept going for almost an hour until they once again separated to face each other. Blade, who like Black Angel was heavily wounded, said ""That""s enough for today, goodbye my lady."" With that he turned and fled the scene. Black Angel tried to follow him but he let loose a smoke screen which allowed him to escape. As the smoke cleared, Black Angel let go a lovely curse word which shocked the others before turning around and walking towards the Titans. ""I thought I told you to stay at the tower.""

Robin pulled up into the garage and gently lifted Black Angel into his arms. He carried her upstairs to her room. He nearly dropped her in shock when he walked into her room.

""Permission to engage?"" ""Negative. You can""t fight an entire facility full of guns and soldiers. Sit tight."" Reluctantly I agreed, not one to disobey an order.

She knew that she shouldn""t be whining or complaining about any of this, that there were other people in the world who have experienced far worse than she has, and thinking like this just made her angry with herself and her weaknesses. But sometimes she couldn""t hold back the dark, depressing thoughts always swirling in the back of her mind. Sometimes, the thoughts just came to the front, invading her consciousness and entrapping her within a dark, eternal void. There were times when it got so bad, that she couldn""t even bring herself to go out into the world. Like right now. Today was Friday, the last day of school for the week, and for some reason, Shino couldn""t bring herself to even get out of bed. Well, she knew why, she just didn""t fully understand why she still felt this way about any of it. ""Hey. Look who it is."" Shino""s head immediately snapped up, her stomach seeming to drop as she recognized the voice of a girl that went to her school. ""It""s our friend, Asada,"" another voice said from her right, and soon, Shino was surrounded. Without warning, hands shoved her into an alleyway, her back slamming against a wall. Several faces leered at her, their eyes cold and expressions sinister. ""What were you doing in such a nice shop like that, huh, Asada?"" The girl in question eyed them coldly, the afternoon sun setting a glare over her glasses as she wondered just how walking through the shopping district led to this. Keeping her expression blank and her tone flat despite the small prick of fear she felt inside, Shino retorted. ""Nothing that concerns you."" The others

""Leaving already?"" Yuri asked, and he was surprised to find a little disappointment accompany those words. ""Unfortunately, I have class in ten minutes."" Otabek cleared his place as he spoke.

""Bye, Otabek."" The blond watched as the college student walked out, somewhat perplexed as he left. He wasn""t sure what was going on, but it was weird and he was somehow liking it.

He felt his cheeks heat up involuntarily and he looked down to see the orange haired girl clinging closely to him as she had been with Tohru. Her smell wafting up to his nose. And closing his eyes as he felt himself being brought to a field of sweet smelling wild flowers. Never before had someone reached out to him like this, not being afraid of him. He had never once been touched by someone his own age either. Let alone a cute girl. He rather...Liked it. He held onto her hand with a soft grip. ""O-oh!"" Kisa gasped, and immediately let go of his hand, snapping him back into reality. ""I-I""m sorry, I j-just..."" Without hesitation, Megumi grabbed her hand back and held it firmly within his own. She gasped again, but made no move to move away. He smiled down at her through the darkness, and wondered briefly is she could even see. ""It""s alright. I don""t mind."" He heard her gulp and he wondered if she was blushing again. They walked in silence, and within a few moments they had made it to the dark kitchen. Sparing the girl, he flicked on the over head lights and he heard her sigh in relief. The two stood in the threshold for a few moments, and he looked down at Kisa, who timidly looked up at him. Their hands where still entwined. Kisa blushed and slipped her hand out of his, and then began wringing her hands nervously. He tilted his head, confused by her gestures. ""I-I""m sorry.

Sure, it was freezing, and she could nearly see her breath, but she didn""t let the goosebumps bother her. The red head didn""t want to go home. Home was boring, and full of regret.

Trying to get me to break down crying? Trying to, god forbid, get me to stop writing it altogether? Well, I""m sorry good sir or ma""am, but I""m made of tougher material than that. In response to your first comment ""It""s going against drrr,' might I point you to the definition of fanfiction? Fiction written by a fan of, and featuring characters from, a particular TV series, movie, etc. Or, maybe what Wikipedia says on the matter? Fan fiction is defined by being both related to its subject""s canonical fictional universe and simultaneously existing outside the canon of that universe. Saying that it goes against the universe when you are on is a little silly, don""t you think? It""s supposed to exist outside canon, that""s why its fanfiction! And the second comment, ""They are enemies! Haven""t you read the manga?' Well, bud, I have. I have read all four translated books of the main storyline as well as the Saika Arc, and I can""t tell you how many times I""ve seen the anime. So I do know what I""m talking about when I write for this universe. I have an OC. It isn""t supposed to be completely canon, since I""m writing in my own character. But then again, you probably aren""t even reading this. Moral of the story, hate will go right over my head, so go ahead and write it if you want. But I do have one question, if this mysterious Guest is reading this. If you tell me that this story - which is as close to canon as I can get it - needs to die

There was a long silence at the other end until Dogget sighed. ""He""s gone.""""What do you mean he""s gone?! What happened while I was in the hospital?""

Flinging aside the blankets, Scully wanted to look for her sword but instead shook off the remaining wisps of the dreamscape. The bathroom light was on. She must have forgotten to switch it off in her need to get to bed the previous night. Mulder was driving her crazy. Even though they weren""t allowed to work together any longer, he was really getting in over his head. Wearily, Scully flicked the light off, glanced at her clock and realized she""d neglected to call Mulder about the implant that had been taken from Duane Barry""s neck. It was either very late or very early. Considering that Mulder had never hesitated to wake her from much needed rest, she picked up the phone. She reached his answering machine and was in the process of leaving a message when she realized that she was not alone. The window behind her shattered. Scully went for her gun, but an arm wrapped around her legs, sending her to her knees. ""Mulder, I NEED YOUR HELP!"" she screamed into the phone before it was wrenched from her grasp. ""Xena? Xena? I need your help. Is Mount Nestos north or south of the Sibar River?"" Gabrielle gently shook the warrior""s bluish face. ""North of the Sibar River..."" Xena gasped out, feeling numb and exhausted. The bard sighed as the warrior""s eyes slid shut again. The knife wound in Gabrielle""s leg was beginning to show signs of infection, but she would go on.

So it was only natural for Kyouya to spend a lot of time with her, letting her sit beside him during class, letting her have lunch with him, letting her stay during the club hours without any sort of payment, and even spending time with her after school at first, but when that only started happening, the Host Club (the twins and Tamaki especially)","{""output"": ""YES""}"

No, Hiro was feeling anxious, and for once it wasn""t about all the cash he was going to make bot fighting. He was going to go to a college drag race where everyone got to show off their cars. If it was anything like how he expected (well, hoped) then it would be his fondest memory. Hiro stared at the ceiling as he lay sprawled on his back. Now that he was sixteen, he technically could drive in the race if he was able to get his hands on a car. Tadashi didn""t own a car (he took the trolley) but he still participated in the racing part, so he must get a car from someone. Maybe if he were lucky, Hiro could barrow one too. With the cheery thought on his mind, he jerked back his covers. After snooping around for a clean pair of pants and a hoody, he locked himself in the bathroom for a quick shower. The remainder of the day dragged by remarkably slow. He spent the majority of his spare time on his computer, drawing up designs and upgrades that he could install for his microbot fighter. He wasn""t a bragger, but he wasn""t going to lose his reputation as the best bot fighter in downtown San Fransokyo because he didn""t upgrade something.

""Move along,"" the tall boy said calmly, never slowing his pace, ""and we might be able to make it before the rain starts. I would prefer to avoid getting stuck in a downpour, especially since we just picked up the new cosplays."" Haruhi tried to move faster, but her legs felt heavier than normal. It didn""t help that the new costumes in her arms were probably around thirty pounds.

By this point she was nearly pulling Kyoya down the sidewalk after her when all of a sudden he jerked her by the elbow again. After a squeal of surprise, she found herself being pulled through a door and into a quaint, brick-walled building. Haruhi barely got out a, ""Wha-?"" when the rain started coming down in buckets.

Text2: It had been just days since I had mustered up the courage to finish my letter to Gale. I was always really good at keeping secrets, so I didn""t tend to worry about people finding out. Especially Peeta. I knew he was already bitter at the thought of me opening the letter instead of getting rid of it due to the troubles that Gale has caused me as well as other people. Though I was so hesitant at first, I never knew how good it could feel to pick up a pen and write to an old friend. My heart raced as I wrote every word; a feeling that I had almost forgotten was possible to feel. Willow had watched me finish the task, and a part of me was very relieved that she couldn""t say many words so that my secret could be kept as long as I needed it to. I also continued to worry of Willow""s safety if Gale decided to just give us a surprise visit, yet there was a deep, but small desire inside of me for him to meet Willow. I always swore on never having kids, and I could just hear a joking remark come from his lips once he saw her. I tried not to dwell on the fact that those dreams would possibly never come true and that I just needed to let it all go and be thankful for who and what I have. That mindset was also completely fine with me to have to dwell on at the same time. ""Come on, Willow..come on.""

Katniss didn""t know her name, but knew she had arrived with her dad and brother a few weeks before. Peeta""s hand was touching her shoulder and then she said something and he laughed out loud. Katniss starred mutely at the pair. The girl was everything she wasn""t. Tall and beautiful with pronounced curves hugged by a simple, yet beautiful dress. Long, straight blonde hair and blue eyes. Katniss had no curves, hardly wore dresses and was painfully aware of her inadequacies physically. And the girl had made Peeta laugh. She never made him laugh, she was always too serious. This is what he wants. And I can never be her. As the thoughts clouded her vision she knew she needed to try to let him go so he could be happy. He deserved to be happy after all that had happened to him. She needed to stop being selfish, and let him move on. It might kill her but she didn""t care.

""Well if we all stop bickering for a moment Rythian""s horse actually managed to find a shortcut out of this forest."" Nilesy said walking over to us and pointed over my shoulder. I turned around and looked down the ridge past where the three people would have been. Unsurprisingly to me they have left. ""C""mon we better start moving to Kalico City, the last thing we want is even more trouble."" Sjin huffed guiding his horse down the ridge. I sighed leading Tenebris to follow the big brown Clydesdale. Sunlight outside was a gift to behold and only now can we all really appreciate it. Slowly however the sun seemed to rest going beneath the horizon and giving way to the moon. ""We should camp out on the edge of the forest, then head straight for the City once dawn hits. I""ll take first watch the rest of you get sleep."" Nilesy said hopping down from the beauty of a horse landing softly on the grass below. Sjin slid down the side of his horse slowly and stumbled once his feet touched earth. Zoey, Duncan, and I all hopped off relatively at the same time. Before I could even go and sit down Duncan was yanking me away. ""Get off!"" I yelled at him trying to break free. ""Not until you explain what the Nether is going on?!"" He screamed right back at me. ""Who were those guys?!"" ""I don""t know!"" I crossed my arms and leaned against a tree. He wasn""t letting up, staring at me eyeing me down.

Non could barely think. She still saw the resignation and exhaustion in Devon""s eyes as the axe came down. Rez was pacing furiously as he and Mike waited for Fatal to return. Turtle was curled up in a ball in the corner, shaking as Shadow tried in vain to comfort her. ""How did you find us?"" Shadow finally asked, breaking the terse silence. ""Bought the coords,"" said Rez casually. ""A few million in the right places works wonders."" Iluv looked at him in shocked horror. ""Who...?"" ""Wyatt,"" said Rez triumphantly. ""Sold you out to whichever one of your enemies paid him the most. ""But why?"" Non gasped. ""He knew you didn""t trust him. And he was tired of trying to prove himself to you."" ""There""s nothing here,"" Iluv snapped defiantly. ""You came all this way for absolutely nothing. He lied to you the way he lied to all of us."" She slipped back against the wall, exhausted. ""I don""t think so,"" Mike murmured. ""I think we found exactly what we were looking for."" Non wondered vaguely what he meant, but she was too tired to think clearly. They waited another few minutes for Fatal to return, but he didn""t show. ""How long is this going to take?!"" Rez roared. He raked his claws across the wall, leaving five deep gouges.

41,"Text1: I got an earful from Granny Pinako and many death glares and silent treatments from Winry. It was back when we were dating. The reason I left Al in the first place? She had convinced me that I didn""t need anyone. She convinced me that life wasn""t my fault. That shitty things happen to good people. She had convinced me that the laws of alchemy didn""t exist. And that I didn""t need to punish myself. I took a mouthful of noodles. I believed in her. She became my safety net. My oasis in a storm. I looked up at Al to see him munching on a piece of chicken. He looked so happy, so innocent. He wasn""t though. I corrupted him; for years I tortured his mind with thoughts of our dead mother. Talking about her, obsessing over her death. He wasn""t innocent. He""d never be. I tainted him. It wasn""t bad enough that I covered myself in her blood. I shed it on him as well. I sighed and sipped my soda. Even though I killed my brother""s childhood, I couldn""t let him go. And it tortures me that I even left him for as long as I did. I don""t blame Winry; she was trying to help me grow as a person. But I can""t let go of the past. It""s all I live for, trying to right the wrongs that can never be fixed; it""s my cruel, torturous, world that I dragged my brother into and I refuse to let anyone else inside. She got in for a time, and in that short space of happiness we had, I managed to wound my brother beyond all comprehensibility. He never spoke a word of the week that I had abandoned him. But I saw it. In his eyes.

""Kagome will you kindly shut your blasted trap already?"" I snapped at her. She just wouldn""t shut up. Then, she decided to break down crying. I gunned it down the road. Made it home in ten minutes flat; she was still a sobbing mess even as I turned off the engine and opened her door. I sighed and unbuckled her seat belt for her then picked her up in my arms. Maybe I can still get her in bed if I""m careful. ""Kagome?"" I begin gently, my lips at her ear as I walk up the long, winding path to my front door. ""Would you like it if I made you some hot chocolate?"" I softly kiss the hollow just below her ear. I knew she had a weakness for hot chocolate. That ought to soften her up and allow me in her pants; so to speak. She nodded and whipped away the tears on her cheeks as I unlocked the door and walk inside. My house is a mansion. Really it is. I have three levels in my house; the first one is for guests, the second is my own, and the third; the third is for my personal entertainment. ""Can we go to your room?"" Kagome shifted in my arms, her eyes glued to the stairs. ""Yeah."" I begin the walk up the stairs, kissing her cheek, nose, eyelids but never her mouth; until I get to my bedroom door then I tenderly kiss her full, pink lips.

The spotlight has never been a comfortable place for me, even if I""m only around my baby sister I still feel jittery and overly-conscious. She easily takes over the talking when I ask her about school, erupting with stories about her university professors, the cute boy that had sat beside her in one of her courses and a new rom com she had seen with her friends at the cinemas. She radiated an angelic glow when she spoke, her diamond blue spherical eyes gleamed with jubilance and a whimsical resonance ran through every word she let past her lips. I sank into the worn-out seat with a content sigh as we drew closer and closer to the small apartment which we called home. The house hadn""t altered much from the way I had left it over a month ago, but there wasn""t much to change, really. I headed to my bedroom and dropped my bag to the floor with an unexpected heavy thud then turned and headed straight back to the living room where Prim had situated herself. Her brilliant, wide eyes flickered up to meet mine and a happy smile spread across her face as she turns them back down towards her phone. ""You don""t mind if Rory comes ""round do you?"" she questions me casually as she types out a quick text. I was a little surprised by her question; I had expected her to be slightly more interested in spending some time with me seeing as I only just got back, but my little duck wasn""t so much of a little duck anymore and I knew I had to realise it sometime soon. Being the 20-year-old that she is, it was only normal for her to

Finnick asks ""Oh, she worked out all right,"" Prim says with a chuckle while she sits down at the counter I probably turn red again for the 2nd time today, ""Prim, shut up,"" I say and walk to the bathroom before Finnick asks more questions A minute later I hear them all laughing as I take a shower to wipe away all the sweat. I come out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around my head and fresh new clothes. ""Prim, we have to leave! We don""t want to be late!"" I shout out Prim comes out of her room, ""Well if you didn""t hog the bathroom, I probably would""ve been done already."" ""Don""t be a smartass."" She rolls her eyes and goes into the bathroom. While waiting for her, I check her backpack to make sure there are no cigarettes. I know, this sounds weird, but it just proves how much I care about her.

In a flurry of movement, her revolvers were back in their holster and her arms were crossed, eyes turned to the ground.

If she reached just a little lower than they would be there. ""I think you realize now how audacious your actions were."" A ginger haired girl with a toothy grin put her arm around Mata""s shoulder, not catching the dangerous glint in the girl""s eyes. ""Pointing a gun at the captain.

It was like a rickshaw getting run over by a mack truck. Tina had never worked so hard for something and come out with nothing more than a stuttered apology from Todd as he left on wobbly legs and disgustingly stained sheets. It broke her.

I burst into tears and he rests his hand over mine, suddenly understanding so much more than he wanted to know. ""The... the baby?"" He questions, tears reforming in his eyes.

He watched the look of careful attention on her face as she traced each pink or white scar, as her fingers lingered over freckle and flaw alike. Her cheeks had a soft pink glow and her lips were slightly parted in concentration. When her hands moved to apply the salve to his forehead, he couldn""t help himself. He pressed a gentle kiss to the inside of her wrist, his fingers resting lightly on her arm. When lips met skin, Katniss shuddered - just as he had done earlier when her hands touched his back. Something dark flashed across her gray eyes - a look he could only describe as desire - and she didn""t resist when he tugged her toward him. As she moved in his direction, Peeta pushed himself up and captured her lips in his. The kiss was warm and soft, but urgent at the same time. With his hands on her arms, he gently pulled her all the way down to the bed, never once breaking their kiss. He felt the sharp angle of her hips, the delicate curve of her breasts press against him, and it destroyed the tiny bit of self-control he had left. But his mind wouldn""t completely allow his body to take over. He felt an undeniable tug on his thoughts - thoughts that were wrapped up in the present moment with Katniss, the physicality of it all. But then other images flashed across his mind, almost like a damaged recording. Katniss kissing him, their bodies crammed into the small bed in her train compartment. Katniss letting out a moan when Peeta""s hands slipped beneath the silky fabric","{""output"": ""NO""}"

If he had been running before now he was sprinting. he could see the smoke in the distance. It coming from the sky army headquarters. Ty realized. ""No,"" he whispered as he rounded the final corner. It was now a straight shot to the base, and he had a clear view of the rubble that used to be the east wing... (?

People seemed to melt away from him, none would make eye contact, avoiding the stranger as if he were the plague. But for him, that was nothing new. His name was Iven, and though he was by no means threatening in appearance, he had found some time ago that most people had a subconscious knowledge of what he actually was. Iven was a being of the underworld, a Demon if you, will, personally, Iven hated that classification. He also hated that the only other of his kind he had ever encountered was that asshole of a king Herobrine, who ruled over the

She peeked her eyes open at him. The living room was dark but a soft gray glow was leaking through the curtains, so she could make out Jean""s outline. ""What do you want?"" she whined.

They looked like they did some sort of work in the Hotlands, Sans recognized from their matching metal outfits, but he didn""t know what they could be.

When Allison tried to talk to him in Economics he had given her the cold shoulder and ignored the pained look she had sent him. The last thing that he had to make it through was lacrosse practice and even that he had no heart for today. All during Economics he had started to lay the foundations of his plan. For most of the beginning of the class he had his head resting on his desk, occasionally groaning out his fake discomfort. After a particularly loud grunt Coach Finstock threw his arms in the air. ""Balinski! Would you kindly stop masturbating in my class?"" He could hear the amusement in the coach""s voice at calling Stiles out.

Robin approved, giving a thumbs up. ""Well look at that? The door""s not open."" Bubbles jerked her head towards the big yellow door which led to the yearbook room. About five other girls were piled up near the door. ""Who knows. Maybe Ellie isn""t here today."" Robin pointed out. The small group dodged around a few of their rather annoying eight grade peers until they reached the door on the opposite side of the wide hallway section. ""Midori? Whats up?"" Bubbles asked one of her yearbook friends. Midori was a short, brunette seventh grader with a splash of freckles on her nose. Midori bounced eagerly on the balls of her feet. ""The shipment came in!"" ""They did?!"" Bubbles and Robin demanded in harmony, both sounding thrilled. ""Yes!"" Midori answered equally as excited. ""Why are we all out here then?"" Mike asked, towering over the selection of seventh and eighth grade yearbook students. ""Lisse went to get the keys from Mrs. Rutha""s other classroom."" An eighth grader named Taylor answered, leaning against the wall. ""Yeah, except that was five minutes ago!"" A different girl named Emmy pointed out. Her eye lashes were so long, there was no way that they were real. ""Give her a break will ya?"" Midori shot back, one eyebrow raised slightly. ""Yeah!"" Another eighth grader named Teya agreed. """"Sides,"" Katie, Taylor""s best friend, interrupted, ""Ellie already went to see what was taking Lisse so long."" ""Geez people."" Robin muttered under her breath so only Bubbles could hear.

I could see them through my sweater. It started tingling down there and I could resist but to touch it. I used my left hand to touch myself and used my other hand to grope my breast. His face was in front of me and his breath was hot. I moaned louder as every second went by but it wasn""t loud enough to wake his tired and sleepy body up. I pulled down both my shorts and panties revealing my pussy and lift up my sweater and shirt. I can feel it even better now and moaned harder. Something liquid came out of my pussy as I climaxed.

It didn""t use to be like this, she thought, washing potatoes now; she could remember when she had constant company- constant affection... (""I want to leave you, Antonio."") It wasn""t that she had been unhappy when she was with Antonio, because she had been- she had been for a long time. Antonio was kind and optimistic and passionate even when life got hard. When Amihan had first moved to England to live with her grandparents in Primary School she had spoken very little English- only Spanish and Tagalog- and had not been able to make very many friends. It was then that she had met him, Antonio, a boy who spoke in a tongue that she could understand, and he took it upon himself to teach her all of the things she didn""t know. Soon enough he began to dote on her. It seemed natural enough that even after she had begun to fit in with her peers she stayed with Antonio. By then they had became close friends and she didn""t really even see the point in straying from him- all of the friends she had made were friends she knew through him, and she still found herself too shy to venture out and make new ones. It seemed even more natural that, upon her second year of knowing him, they began to date. Dating him was simple; any pre-pubescent awkwardness she had been told to expect did not apply to their relationship. It was not as if they did not spend all of their time together already. And it was not as if they ever did anything so affectionate as kiss in public. To Amihan... dating him was something that was unavoidable, as if it had

She pulled and pulled her wrist, and she was certain that her wrists were bleeding, if not they were badly burnt, but she didn""t care. Things would be a lot worst if she didn""t reach her phone. She pulled and tugged, ignoring every shooting pain in her wrist, ignoring the pounding in her head that still raged on despite her stubbornness. She pulled, and finally, her wrist broke free. She let out a single laugh of pure relief and achievement as she realised she""d finally done it. She spared only a second for celebration before reaching for her phone. She unlocked her phone, momentarily blinded by the light that shone from it. She took in the date and time, taking some relief in noticing that only a few hours had passed since she left the station. She took in the vast amount of texts and missed calls, all from her brothers and Chief Vick, and was happy that at least they knew she was missing. And just as she hit redial, a door burst open. Leia quickly took in the fact that she was held in a basement. There were stairs in front of her and a door at the top had just opened. A tall man stood in the door and casually made his way down. She was just as shocked to see his face as she was hours ago when she was first taken. She knew this man, she saw him every day at the café, and she would have never in a million years thought he was capable of doing something like this. And yet here he was. ""I""m sorry to do this

So stop wasting time, and tell me where the boy is."" ""Even if I did know, I wouldn""t tell you."" Hook glared at Wendy for a while and then grabbed her arm and forced her to follow him. He forced her onto the plank and pulled out his sword making her move to the very end of the narrow block of wood. Wendy look at the water cautiously knowing that this time no one could save her. ""The crocodile isn""t the only beast that lives in the sea! There are plenty more that wouldn""t say no to a tasty snack!"" Hook yelled. ""Now call for Peter! Ask him to save you again."" Wendy just stared at him, not sure what to say. ""TOO LONG!"" Hook yelled and stomped on the plank. Wendy screamed as she tried to catch her balance again. ""CALL FOR PETER PAN! TELL HIM TO SAVE YOU!"" he said and stomped plank again making Wendy scream and dropped to the her knees, holding on to the plank to keep her balance. ""I can""t!"" Wendy cried. ""Don""t be stupid!"" Hook yelled and took a step towards her and put his sword to her throat. ""Why not?"" ""He wouldn""t come to save me"" Wendy whispered. Hook""s eyes narrowed. ""Why not?"" Hook asked again.

Kaname added, making me chuckle softly as I placed my hand on the banister. ""I""ll be sure to let you know."" I assured him before turning and climbing up the stairs, not noticing how everyone seemed to watch me leave until I was out of sight. When the trees finally reached full bloom everyone agreed to go and view them as a family and Wataru insisted that we took bread for the ducks. Since it was warm and very sunny, I pulled on a sundress of pure white with a halter neck top then twisted my hair into a messy bun at the back of my head. Although a few comments were received I brushed them off effortlessly, no longer embarrassed or surprised by my brothers even as some of them did a double take. ""Wow big sis, you look like a princess!"" Wataru complimented as he ran to me and I ruffled his hair, smiling down at him. ""Thanks little bunny. Have you got everything ready for the picnic?"" I asked and walked past everyone else, ignoring their gobsmacked expressions as Wataru told me that all that was left to pack were the drinks so I fetched them from the refrigerator and made sure we had plates and cutlery as well as plastic cups. ""Alright, we""re all set so let""s go!"" Smiling excitedly I ushered everyone out the door, wanting to go and see the

He assured his son and Kyoya tightened his grip on my arm at his irritation before he bowed to his father so I did the same, letting him lead me away. ""You never give up, do you?"" He demanded the moment we were out of earshot, letting me go and striding ahead. ""Now I am forced to waste my day with you just to keep up pretences."" Taking a deep calmly breath Kyoya sighed then turned around, painting a smile on his face and stretched his hand. ""Very well, where should you like to go Akiyama-chan?"" He asked me however I knocked his hand aside proudly as I passed him, knowing that he was right. Now we had to spend the day together otherwise his father would get suspicious. I walked out of the hospital and to the car that bore the Ootori family crest, opening the door myself and stepping inside as Kyoya followed after me. ""So, where shall we go?"" He asked before his face fell in boredom slightly. ""Amusement park, the arcade, the ocean park, the zoo..."" I arched an eyebrow at his suggestions before pulling out a few brochures from my bag and flicked through them, selecting a few before I presented them to him. ""Hm? You want to go to these places."" I lifted a finger and held it out to him. ""Just one, alright then."" He glanced through them before quickly becoming intrigued, seeing that I was interested in museums and botanical gardens. ""In that case, this one looks good.""","{""output"": ""YES""}"

We simultaneously start darting through the halls passing maids so quickly the fabrics in their hands fly out of their grip. An emerald and black fabric nears my face as I hear the maids call that they need my opinion on fabrics. I throw the fabric to the nearest maid calling to them I like that one. Within a few minutes we are almost out of the castle, but we are soon running towards a blockade made of my sisters and their ladies in waiting. A smirk rises to our faces as we continue to run and

When I walked into the main part of the café I felt people stare at me as I went to ask Wesley my assignment. ""What do you need me to do?"" I asked broadly.

His touch was a tainted, but fulfilling. It made her not so tense, even when she wanted to be. Sliding the pistol back into the drawer, she wiggled out of his constricted embrace to start breakfast. As the water dribbled down her skin in the warped warmth of the shower, she worked her hair into a lather and rinsed. Breakfast had been reasonable enough to eat, even with the many distractions of the vampire prince, as he prodded at her time after time. What had made her offer herself to him once again? Why did she succumb to those topaz stars in his eyes? She stepped out of the bathroom dressed in a black tank top, and grey sweat pants. Her skin was chilled from the cold that seemed to fill the room. Her hair was dripping wet still from the shower. She was trying to get some of the excess water with the towel, when he stepped in the room. She trembled again, the reoccurring sick feeling in her stomach returned once more. He stared at her thoughtfully, as he started to close the gap between them, he smiled. There was meant to be warmth behind it, but it was cold. His eyes ran across her skin, ""You""re freezing."" he murmured. ""I need to turn on the heat. It""ll only take a second."" She said walking passed him into the hallway. She didn""t want him to get impatient with her, she had never seen him angry. She wanted to keep it that way. When she walked back into the room, he sat at the foot of her bed, and waited

Dropping him to the floor she turned back to all the bewildered stares. She gave them all a stare of death, ""Show""s over!"" she announced, her eyes catching a figure slipping out of the room through a nearby door. Those purple eyes were gone. It had to have been him. He was not leaving without giving her some answers. She had her mind made up. Quickly she turned on her heel to pursue the man, not looking back to give Bigby any notice. She went out the door the mysterious man used as an exit and found herself in a back alleyway. The gleam of neon letters that spelled exit were the only real source of light. The streetlights at the end of the alley gave a dim source, but again he was gone. She started down the alley, hoping to still get a glance at the man. ""Hey!"" barked Bigby from behind her. She immediately froze and took a short glance to see him approaching. Her heart skipped a beat when she saw the figure of the man who had been working for tall, dark, and","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Cloud had always heard that the General was fierce combatant and harsh character. People had always told Cloud that the General was a mean man. Killed for fun, and grinned as he did it, had almost a permanent scowl on his smooth, pale features. None of that seemed true now that he had met the General in person.

Zax climbs to his feet and walks from the room grumbling the whole way. He finally makes it to the barracks and lets himself into the room.

74,"Text1: Each step takes us closer to the blank darkness. The crimtane grinding infiltrated the corrupt dungeon of sorrow and finally we found them. Enigmatical embodiments of the littlest fear shards, their stares sent blank yet meaningfully terrifying blight of pain right to their target. My pure diamond edge passed through one of their bodies, which was made of unlively terror. But in just one-tick timeframe, my smallest peripheral nerves felt a deep, unclearly fading and darkly corrupted feel seeping through the depth of my flesh, straight to the arteries- a bite on my neck. As the panic struck my mind, my limbs gone uncontrollable and helplessly swinging around in attempts to take off the bite. A powerfully raging blow torn the very head of the evil, searing through the brain of pain, leaking nasty, rotting ooze. It was Harry. His mighty big axe gleamed deeply under the starlight that passed through holes on the damp, deep blue brick ceiling. I could hear souls screaming silently inside the walls. In the hard moments, a warlike angry voice waved through the sounds of freaking evils. Andrew bellowed in fright as he gets his potion. I fought calmly, even though I can feel ominous presences inside the eyes of the terrors. I unleashed my enchanted diamond sword, shining greatly below the creepily dim torchlight, mixing the fantasy of fears and forces. It cut through their limbs easily like a lumberjack cutting through the wood. But they came to us like endless, circling clouds of waves. Andrew hissed as few skeletons were rattling, signified a vengeful battle. Their bones reflect the core of the dungeon itself, that was made of solely pure, lightless hatred. Their bones were crunched below Andrew""s modded pickaxe, launching few of the shards of hate and definitely killed them. And

And that I didn""t need to punish myself. I took a mouthful of noodles. I believed in her. She became my safety net. My oasis in a storm. I looked up at Al to see him munching on a piece of chicken. He looked so happy, so innocent. He wasn""t though. I corrupted him; for years I tortured his mind with thoughts of our dead mother. Talking about her, obsessing over her death. He wasn""t innocent.

His facial features also changed- he went paler as his face became gaunt, hauntingly creepy. His boyish grin twisted into a sneer that made her stomach drop.

The next morning, I couldn""t get out of bed. My mother tired to lure me up. Oh, she did. She baited with Chinese takeout for breakfast, then she baited with a trip to the mall. Finally, after several more tries, she just dropped a bomb with me there in my pjs, awake but feeling absolutely no desire to crawl out of bed. ""Listen, Suze,"" She went, all friendly-sounding. ""I""m flying to Carmel tomorrow. You would be coming with me, but as of now, they have no space left open at Robert Louis Stevenson or the Juniperro Mission Academy.

He took it as a ‚no"" and put it back, starting to wonder whether she was actually mad at him or just pretending to be. It drove him crazy that he didn""t seem to be able to figure it out. When she got to the plants he thought they must be close to the end so he took the slip of paper from her hand. ""What are you doing?"" ""I""m going to get the stuff that you want,"" he said and leaned in for a quick kiss. He could swear that he saw her smile before he turned around and walked off. She shook her head with a smile, still trying to ignore the faint throbbing between her legs. Being so utterly distracted with something so simple as picking candles had done little to put her mind off it but it had helped for a little while. She hadn""t spoken to him, knowing that it would drive him crazy and she couldn""t afford to have her resolve crumble entirely before they got back to the house. By now she was so turned on and horny that she didn""t quite trust herself so she was glad when Mulder walked off to get the things they picked. Scully wondered if it was worth getting new plants because she wasn""t really skilled when it came to keeping them alive and flourishing but she decided to give it another shot.

I felt my cheeks burn and I covered my eyes. ""Why did he have to be here then?"" I thought. I peeked through my fingers at my ceiling; half expecting Danny to phase through it. I heard a knock on my door. ""Rachel?"" my mom called. I sniffled and sat up. ""Yeah mom?"" I replied. My mom opened my door and chuckled. ""Well, you look like crap."" I rolled my eyes. ""Gee, thanks mom. Love you too."" My mom laughed. ""I already called the school and let them know that you""re staying home today."" she said. ""Thanks mom.""

""I""ll go with you."" I said, and Akira smiled in thanks to me. It seems that she knows who it is already. We walked towards the door and a woman stood just inside of it, Akira tightly grabbed my hand. She has long brown hair and violet eyes. I suddenly realized who it was, and Akira tightened her grip on my hand. ""Akira, I heard that you""re pregnant."" The woman said. ""Yes I am. What do you want mother?"" Akira snapped. ""I want you to come home, Akira."" Her mother said. ""I am never going back to your house! You can""t legally make me, because I am already emancipated from you."" Akira said, her voice trembling. ""Kyoya. Convince her yourself. She needs me right now, and she is not able to see that."" Her mother said, turning to me. I felt anger at this woman, the same woman who practically threw Akira onto the street, and the same woman who now wants to take her back.

They don""t have much of a fascination for transportation however. They are more wealthy then outer districts, but are still poor. While not canon, I quite like the idea that district 6 is heavily populated by gangs and is the most dangerous district to live in. District Seven District 7 is the lumber district. They have to start working at a young age, and often have experience with an ax. But that doesn""t mean that they can send one through a kids throat, with them not producing many careers(or victors for that matter). District Eight District 8 is the textile district. They are often considered the most friendly district, though they are also one of the most rebellious. District Nine District 9 is the wheat district. The people of this district must usually fend for themselves, and are often very harsh. District Ten District 10 is the livestock district. It is most often depicted as being very spread out and populated by small farms that are mostly left to their own business. District Eleven District 11 is the agriculture district. These people often start work early, and have the harshest peacekeepers around. They are usually strong, and have a good knowledge of the land. District Twelve District 12 is the mining district. Often forgotten by others in Panem, this district has the smallest peacekeeper force, is the smallest district, and is the poorest as well.

Also, this obvservance shows that Ichigo now pays attention to even the smallest things when it involves Orihime. ""Milady""- Ichigo: word play on Orihime""s name (""hime"" means ""princess"") ""Kurosaki-ouji"" -Orihime: In reference to Ichigo""s word play on her name (he calls her princess, she calls him prince) ""Orihime/Ichigo""- Shows that there is a new level of intimacy between the two because of the change in the name usage (Calling another person by their first name signifies that the two people are very close, calling a person by their last name is much more formal). Chapter 19: I force mi descindiente (my decendant)- Basically when ulquiorra died, he turned into ashes, not because of ichigo""s zanpakuto, but because of the injuries that he sustained when figting ichigo as a vasto lorde. Also, when he died, he died with regrets. So, this is twist/theory: because ulquiorra died this way, he left an ""imprint"" or ""echo"" for someone else to convey to orihime. Since all the hollows were once human, it is resonable to imagine that ulquiorra has living descendants left on earth. Maverick is ulquiorra""s last living descendant, and that was why he kept having those ""siezures"" in pervious chapters: he""s basically ""seeing"" ulquiorra""s last/most impacting memories.

The Devil twins laughed at ""Tono""s statement. Takashi Morinozuka or Mori is the silent and wild type in the Host Club, which confused the Fujioka twins because he wasn""t wild at all. The senior has black hair, a pair of onyx eyes, really tall, and he has tan skin. He helped Haruhi without a second thought whenever the blonde idiot or Tamaki hugged her without permission. He""s also protective to his cousin, Mitsukuni Haninozuka. Mitsukuni Haninozuka or Honey is the loli-shota type. The Fujioka twins almost thought that the senior is a little kid in Elementary, but was shock to hear that he was a senior in high school. The small senior has blonde hair, a pair of brown eyes, really short, and fair skin. The boy was really good at martial arts and loves cute things. He also likes to ride on Mori""s back and always go with Usa-chan, his bunny doll. The twins come to a conclusion; the Host Club is full of weirdoes, except for Haruhi. They also concluded to annoy the heck out of the members; they both refused to call them by their names or nicknames. They called them by their surname with a sempai on

She looked behind her shoulder, finding a German Shepherd, three months old by the looks of it. The soldier who was holding the leash ran towards the girl as she began to pet it, scratching it behind its ear. ""Sorry about that.... He""s a really hyper one."" The soldier apologized. ""We""re training him to be a tracker, I guess he tracked the wrong object."" ""No problem."" Zoe kept on petting the dog. ""Mr. Epps, correct?"" Epps blinked in surprise.

But so far, they""d seen nothing that warranted any investigation. They had met a few of the local people and introduced themselves as Rob and Laura Petrie. Everybody had seemed very nice; no obsessive rules and regulations to be seen anywhere, Thank God! But then, all in all it was looking like this might be a bit of a dud assignment. After catching a spot of lunch at a local restaurant - recommended by Bob and Mary Jeffers from down the road - Mulder and Scully had decided to head back to their house. Scully was going to do some grocery shopping while Mulder took the mystery note off the forensic lab in the city to be analysed. He would be gone fore a good 4 hours, which , Scully thought to herself smugly, would give her plenty of time to start her report and get some housework done. As they turned the corner back onto their street, Scully caught a glimpse of something white in the corner of her eye. She turned her head and looked across the road. A cold sweat suddenly breaking out across her forehead. Standing there, staring at her with deadened eyes was somebody who could not be there. Scully stopped dead in her tracks, her breathing desperately shallow. The urge to run was overwhelming. Mulder turned from where he had walked on. As soon as he saw her face, his eyes grew serious and he stepped closer to her. ""Laura, what is it?' Scully turned her gaze away from the figure and glanced at Mulder with eyes unseeing. She raised a trembling hand

She""d had dinners or lunches or breakfasts with everyone she""d wanted to bid farewell. Stella was willing to forgo the obligatory cake in the break room along with the emotional partings. She contemplated a cardboard box she""d recycled from the paper supply room. It had a lid and enough space for her personal items. There""d be plenty of room; partly because she""d never replaced the picture from her wall that had turned out to be a stolen ancient Greek masterpiece. Besides, after her years in the orphanage and in foster care-Stella was a woman used to travelling light. Plus, Mac Taylor insisted all paperwork and case files be up to date. She agreed because in their line of work you never could predict what life would bring. If anything happened, your cases could go on allowing you to continue to serve the people of New York City. Now, she""d be serving a wider base. Her new job at Homeland Security in Washington, D.C. meant working on cases and threats from around the country. It wasn""t just the money or the title for Stella; it was a chance to prevent tragedies along with working on crimes. She""d been flattered when the offer came to her even though she figured she was second choice to Mac. Chief Sinclair made it clear that she""d been approached as the number one choice of the Feds.

So, it came as quite a surprise to you when a letter from Steve dropped through your letter-box one day. And, what a strange letter it was. Little did you know, this letter would change your life forever. It was written on a perfectly square piece of paper, and it said: Dear Reader, Why not come and stay with me for the weekend? I live in MineTown, I""m sure you""ve herd of it We""ll have a blast and talk about old times. Won""t you come and stay? Don""t bother replying, just come! Your old pal, Steve. At first, you wonder why it was addressed to ""Reader"" but you quickly remember that ""Reader"" was his nick-name for you in high school. Steve had given it to you when you first met. You remember it clearly, you were sitting in a café with your geography text books spread out on the table; the end of year exam was coming up. Steve had spotted you and asked if you liked geography too. You replied that geography was a perfectly fine subject, but you much preferred reading over geography. Apparently he was something of a ""Geographer"". It was one of the only occasions you talked. Apart from your meeting, you can""t think of any more ""old times"" which might be inviting you to discuss. And you had no idea where ""MineTown"" was. Still, you fancy a weekend away, and a vague curiosity is piqued within you: what could Steve be doing nowadays? If you remember correctly he did not do very well in the final exams... apart from geography of course. You climb the stairs with a thoughtful anticipation and begin to pack your bags. Should you pack sun-glasses?

She was so buttoned-up, so straight-laced every day, that this notion shocked the hell out of him. So non-sequitor, so unbelievably sexy. Still, he couldn""t ask, he wasn""t sure what it was she wanted. ""You know exactly what I want,"" he said, through clenched teeth. Her mouth was millimeters away from where he wanted her... just one upward thrust and he could make contact. Mulder was slowly losing his resolve. ""Ask me, Mulder. Tell me,"" she said, a bit more firmly, tightening her grip on his now painfully erect cock, before leaning up until her mouth was right next to her ear. ""Let me tell you a little secret about me,"" she purred into his ear. ""It turns me on when you ask, or tell me, explicitly, what you want me to do."" ""Christ Scully,"" he screeched. ""Please, god, I just want you to... Suck on me Scully, I want you to put my cock in your mouth!"" He heard her moan softly at his desperate request, and then took him completely in her mouth, without hesitation. Mulder groaned instantly, and felt he may actually die from the sheer pleasure of this sensation. Her mouth was hot and wet, and as her head began to bob up and down, he felt her tongue swiping the length of him with each painstaking stroke. He was going to come undone very soon, he just knew it.

The twist was certainly interesting and would make up for a good Games. After all, the people wanted to see broken children as they were whisked from their time, only to die in an age where nobody knew them. There was a voting going on in the Capitol. The tributes who would get maximum votes will be brought back from the past, right from the moment when they will be facing their death. A victor""s life was not the best. Sedan had to give speeches, make appearances, and praise the capitol. But Sedan hated them with passion. He had a nice house, a lot of money, but the boy was filled with self-hate and self-disgust. Sedan had been Six""s victor in almost ten years. For this, he was respected in his district, especially because he was a victor with only one kill. That one kill was a little too violent though. In his desperation and anger, he had literally ripped the boy from Ten. Little Wool was only fourteen, and so Sedan had the strength to take him down. However, Sedan was happy with for his sister. Lisa was thirteen, a sweet, bubbly girl who always made Sedan smile even when he was down, or was crying because of his time in the arena. His little sister was a princess for him, a fairy and an angel, and he could give his life, and take anyone else""s. ""Sedan!"" she yelled as she ran","{""output"": ""NO""}"

When he heard an argument behind him he turned to see his fiance Merlin Emry arguing with his guardian Gaius about something seemingly important but Arthur was too far away to hear. Merlin looked tiredly at the man who had helped him through his teen years and helped him rebuild his walls after the abuses of his father. You see Merlin was born in a small town and his mother cared for him as if he were the most precious thing in the world. His father on the other hand was very disturbed by this and abused Merlin both physically and verbally. Although the final straw was when he cut Merlin across the chest leaving an awful scar that Arthur hated. Shortly after finally divorcing the evil man Hunith realized that her now teenage son was broken and needed guidance from a positive male role model. So having no other choice and very few options she had sent her only child to live with her brother Gaius in the larger city of London. Gaius was protective, patient, loving and caring while taking care of Merlin. This allowed Merlin to grow and learn because Gaius home schooled him and allowed him to feel safe. Now a grown adult Merlin still looked to Gaius for advice and comfort if he and Arthur were fighting. Their present argument was because Arthur wanted Merlin to accompany him to a conference so he could introduce him to the other big wigs. This involved flying in an airplane and Merlin got very air-sick and although he sometimes didn""t puke he always felt terrible during the entire flight. Not to

By now Kimiaru had stopped chant and as he opened his eyes what he saw he did not expect, A full grown Grey wolf its face covered in scars from battles long gone, biting into the underside of the Giant Spider, its bloodstained fur shimmering in the moonlight that seemed to be glowing down upon the wolf like a holy light. ""Well, I guess learning a so called ""dead language"" does have its benefits."" He let out a small smile looking admirable to the wolf as it gnashed the spiders flesh and clawed it to pieces. The spider turned pure black and then exploded into cloud of dark black smoke. Billowing into the sky.

As the other three ate, the Elf picked up his staff and slammed the lapis pick axe into the base of a tree. After a couple more strikes, the whole tree came down. ""I have 43 wood,"" Siris said. ""I will make some pick axes so you can go mining,"" and he smashed the wood into planks, which he then smashed together into a crafting table.

(NB David was an ancient Jewish king who slew a giant named Goliath who was threatening Israel) He was long a widower, much older than I, in truth his children from his first wife were all older than me, but he was well settled, the finest carpenter for many miles, a great lover of the Lord and quite handsome too. He spoke to my father and with my consent, for in his kindness Joseph would not marry me otherwise, our marriage was settled. Before our marriage I awoke one night to see a messenger of God clothed in white, shinning like the sun, standing at the foot of my bed. He said to me, ""Hail full of grace! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women."" I was struck with fear but the messenger said, ""Fear not Mary, for you have found grace with God. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and shall bring forth a Son; and you shall call him Jesus. He shall be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God shall give Him the throne of David His father, and he will reign in the house of Jacob.

It was only minutes after a snowstorm, but the two couldn""t bear another moment locked inside their mansion staring at the workers putting up Christmas decorations and listening to their mother and father bicker about the guest list. They snuck out of the back servant""s entrance and made their way out to the back road, pushing the snow out of their way as they went. So they walked, their foots sinking deep into the snow with every step they took. They walked for several blocks until they were out of their privileged neighborhood and onto the normal streets. ""This is a commoners place."" Hikaru frowned as he took in his surroundings. They stood near a corner of a closed convince store with toys displayed in the window. The buildings appeared to be industrial where they built machinery but it wasn""t currently in use this time of year. ""How long do you figure till they realize we""re gone?"" Hikaru asked, his eyes locked on the white sky above them as they leaned against one of the buildings. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his twin brother shrug and sigh, the air in front of his face puffing as he spoke. ""I don""t know...hour""s maybe. Before we left I saw Mother quarreling with one of the decorators and Father was crossing off every name on the guest list that he could think of."" ""Of course.""

Mulder refused the greeting, prompting Krycek to turn to Scully. ""Long time, no see, Agent Scully."" Scully turned away. ""Did I miss something here?"" Krause asked. ""Let""s just say we have a history,"" Krycek replied. ""I""ve had to clean up after Agent Mulder and his so-called theories."" ""You know they""re true,"" Mulder yelled, pointing at Krycek. ""What are you here to cover up this time? How""d they let you back in the FBI?"" ""Mulder. Your shouting won""t do any good,"" Scully said, getting up from her chair as well. ""Why did Skinner send you?"" Mulder asked Krycek. ""He knew he had to,"" Krycek replied. ""I""m sure,"" Scully commented. ""You have something for us that might be crucial to the case?""

Kaoru made his way silently over to his seat and sat on the desk to catch his breath. I wonder where Hikaru is hiding. I wish we could have finished our prank. It would have been fun. The goal of the prank was to make the seeker be forced to look through all the rooms since they were tampered with to make it look like someone had gone in there, so that they could make sure that there was no one hiding anywhere. Then they were going to purposely throw a rock or something into the rooms to make a sound and to make the person who was ""it"" go back to reexamine the room. Then when they got bored they were going to go into one of the rooms already checked and hide in separate spots so that they couldn""t be accused of hiding together. The plan was foolproof!

Hesitantly, she opened the small refrigerator, then let out a relieved breath when she noted that it seemed to be used solely for food. Stirring the milk into her coffee, she moved back to the table. She wrapped her hands around the mug and blew gently on the surface before taking a tentative sip, then looked up when the door was pushed open. ""Tox screen was clean.""

""So you acknowledge that me, you, and Hero, all look like idiots?""Télos hesitated. ""Yes."" From the End, the god of gold had brought with him one set of armor to enchant. Hero already had a diamond one in his room - something that amazed Kaito - so he was good. Télos had created his own with his powers of gold. The set that he had returned with, however, was the one that Kaito was stuck with. Said set was all black. He guessed that made sense, since it was coming from the End.

Long story short, Steve was depressed the last couple weeks and his friends wanted him to feel better. So, with good intentions, took him drinking. Then he met this girl, his lust got the best of him, and so he took her home. Then somehow Chloe found out and thats how we got here.

""Well... my family""s rich."" ""Ah,"" Minako nodded her head in understanding. Though most of the Tasks Force weren""t rich, there were a few heirs of famous companies that joined. They usually joined because of their talent, although she heard a few wanted more adventure than what higher society approved of. ""Don""t worry about it then.""

Akura Homura, the Ice Queen of the Tasks Force. She was kind when you got to know her, but she could be a hell of a lot scary when she wanted to be. The other was a girl with waist-long black hair and brown eyes. But what really identified her was her glasses; they could never forget the scolding one of the Tasks Force got when they accidentally broke them. She was usually nice, Minako remembered, but a little (read: very) blunt. Her sharp tongue was something to look out for. ""Class, we have several new students.

I slowly started to make my way to her. I sat down next to her putting my arms around her shoulders. She instantly started to sob into my chest. I just smoothed the back of her long, black hair.

Night had fallen over three hours ago, and I was staring at the small clock on the wall of my room which read: 11:00pm. We were to arrive in District Five by the morning, and I knew that Rose was not all that pleased. We did not talk after stopping at District Two. I did not comment on her conversation with my sister. In Districts Three and Four, the most we said to each other was ""hello,"" ""goodnight,"" or ""pass the bread."" That was all. She made no attempt to talk to me, not did I to her. Now, though, she willing said the first word. ""Hi,"" I replied, turning around to see that she was standing in the doorway.

Ejaculating into his elder brother""s awaiting hand, Karou whined into the lip lock as Hikaru came inside him, unable to think of anything but the raw emotions the two shared as it occurred. It was the type of orgasm that, only they two, could feel the intense emotion they each felt for the other, and made it all the more worthwhile to feel. Slowly ceasing his thrusts to a stop, the older twin placed one final kiss between his shoulder blades before pulling out almost reluctantly and shakily standing up.

Pulling out her contact pad, Aira flipped through the coded locations that her employer had sent her, and she scanned the sheet quickly. Didi""s Cafe, a well known and dodgy joint that held conspirators, criminals and senators alike. A good place to blend in. Taking a seat against the wall in one of the corners of the crowded restaurant, Aira politely ordered a concoction of freela and pomegranate juice as she waited. Her Jedi instincts that had never quite left her allowed her to listen to numerous conversations at once, but also made her suspicious of every action and motive. How could people live so ridiculously and recklessly? If her previous training had taught her anything, it""s that she was gifted to judge and meditate on every little irksome thing she found in humans and aliens alike. Waiting was Aira""s least favorite game after hyperdrive. Of course, she decided that if no one showed up within twenty minutes of the rendezvous, that she was probably being hoodwinked, set-up or cheated, and would leave. She never got the opportunity. A person wearing a dark brown cloak entered the boisterous atmosphere of the bar, though they seemed tentative. Aira watched interested. The man, Aira deduced, judging by his stiff demeanor and bulkier appearance... no, perhaps a boy, walked into the midst of the carousers and sat at an empty table hesitantly. He was waiting for someone. My cue, Aira told herself, slipping gracefully and unnoticed towards the stranger, who she assumed was her client. ""Can I buy you a drink, sir?"" she asked politely, pulling up a mismatched chair next to the cloaked boy. ""I don""t accept drinks from strangers,""

He mumbles apologies and he showers me in kisses to try and distract me from the pain. Eventually our hips are flushed together and he is deep inside me. He is right. It does hurt. My body is just not used to the intrusion but at the same time there is something thrilling about being joined with him in this way. Peeta curses and mutters something that sounds like ""so tight"". I wrap my arms around him to keep him close. I am at a loss of what to do from here and hope he will guide me. He waits a moment to allow me to get used to him being inside of me before kissing me sweetly and slowly pulling out of me. He starts off with slow long thrusts. It is uncomfortable at first but as I get used to the sensation it begins to feel somewhat nice. He watches my face to see my reaction. Stopping when he sees me grimacing and kissing me when I whimper. But slowly it starts to feel better. As my grimaces lessen Peeta grows bolder and more purposeful. He hitches my leg around his hip taking me deeper. I gasp as he hits a spot inside of me that I did not know existed. This spurs Peeta on and his thrusts pick up. He hits that spot again and again. I grip onto him tightly as the pain subsides and is replaced by pleasure. I can feel my body responding to his actions. The familiar tingling whenever my emotions become too strong runs throughout my whole body. His hands sweep across my breast, tweaking

Almost forgetting about the arcane energy locked inside of with my Ender Pearl, I teleported away. I had been on the brink of death and survived. The water, the sun. They danger us. They hurt us. It appears that things with immense beauty hurt us the most. I laughed at the thought.

Taking his reply as a yes, Nora leaned forward and began pressing long, lingering kisses along the back of his neck, her fingers still working at its base. She felt his breath hitch, and her fingers slowed, her hands moving to trace down his back. They came to rest at his sides, and she blew gently across the dampened skin before leaning down and murmuring to him, asking if he felt better now. He nodded, unable to form coherent thought, his eyelids flickering. Another laugh, a soft one this time, slipped from between her lips and into his ear. ""I really love you, you know that?"" He simply turned his head and smiled back at her, his expression answering her question all too well. The pair stayed like that for a few minutes, a bit drunk on happiness because this was real, they were alive, and they were in their apartment, together-together. After some time, Nora sat up, cracked her back, and stretched, still straddling Ren. ""Ready for lunch?"" ""What should we have for lunch?"" Ren asked, finally pulling on a t-shirt. Nora, her lips a bit swollen from Ren""s thank-you for the massage, bounced over to their fridge to inspect their options. ""We could have some more of the casserole Jaune""s dad made us. We didn""t eat all of it last night, and it""s got all those yummy potatoes and cheese in it!"" ""Sounds like a plan. I""ll heat it up if you set the table?""

The boy sighed and turned, walking across the roof. I slid to the ground and the boy looked back at me. ""Rachel."" ""How do you know my name?"" I quickly asked. The boy walked over to me and crouched down in front of me. ""So you don""t remember middle school? At all?"" he asked. I felt memories start to flood through my mind, but I pushed them away. I shook my head. ""I...I..."" I started, but I couldn""t find the words to finish my thought. The boy sighed, before smiling at me. ""Jonesy."" I froze. I slowly looked at the boy as a wave of realization hit me. At that same moment, Danny phased through the roof. ""Rachel!"" he shouted, running over. He was about to hit the boy in front of me, but I stopped him. ""Wait..."" I started. ""What is it?"" Danny asked. ""I...I think I know him."" I whispered. Danny""s expression slightly softened as he helped me stand. I turned to look at the boy, who was now standing as well. ""...W-Will...?"" The boy smiled and took his mask off, to reveal shining green eyes and a patch of freckles. ""Hey there baby girl."" he said, a grin on his face. I felt tears in my eyes and Danny and Will both got alarmed looks on their faces, before I hugged Will. I could feel Will sigh and hug me back. I pulled away and looked at him. ""Are you okay?

Olivia had given her a hug, since she had gotten somewhat closer to the girl, and told her to come and visit them soon. Victoria, however, had given Alice the chance to use her boot as a weapon once again, to pry the auburn-haired girl off of herself. Arthur just smiled and waved goodbye when Francis had drove up and away after Alice had gotten into the car. Arthur turned to Victoria. ""When are you going home?"" He asked, sending a glare her way. Victoria shrugged and smiled. ""Ivan said he""ll come by to get me and then we""ll go to his house in Russia. After that, I don""t know, I""ll probably stay at his house for a little while."" She said happily. ""Ivan?"" Olivia asked. ""Oh, he""s Victoria""s boyfriend."" Arthur said. Olivia nodded silently, contemplating what she should say next. Later that evening, Olivia, Arthur and Victoria were eating and talking. ""So Olivia, do you have anything you may want to do as a career?"" Victoria asked. Olivia shrugged. ""Not really..."" She said, taking a forkful of food and eating it. ""Hm...maybe we can find something for you to do."" Victoria said. Olivia shrugged again and started nibbling on a scone, grabbing one from the pile that had remained barely touched until then. ""Oh, this is good!"" She said happily. Victoria""s eyes grew wide.

Genevieve chuckled softly as I wrapped the shirt above the wound and tightened it as much as I could, ""Dan! There""s children here!"" She sighed a bit, ""You""re never going to change, Danny.

He slips his middle finger inside of me and starts moving it in and out, slowly, gauging my reaction. He keeps rubbing my clit, alternating between slow and hard circles. It feels amazing, and I am racing towards the edge. He adds a second finger, and the feeling of him stretching me pushes me over the edge. Just as the first wave of pleasure hits, he stops. ""No!""

Angela had never used him for selfish reasons, only once almost, when she had asked him to escort one of her female clients to a fancy dinner, but she had tried to right it wrong the very same evening, chancing a multi-million dollar account just to preserve his dignity. But it was too late. The words were out and he could see the effect they were having on Angela.

147,"Text1: Heart castle rose from the ground grandly, a spectacular mix of gothic spires and fairy-tale hearts. It reached royally for the sky, panes of glass reflecting the light like studded diamonds, surrounded by a selection of exotic and lavish gardens. Joining together the patches of well-tended greenery was a complex maze of strict hedges, the beauty of which could only fully appreciated by the birds that flew above. Patrolling the maze in a stern, rhythmic pattern was a collection of tireless guards, though their cycle had left a certain primly-cut hedge completely clear. Suddenly, two leather-clad hands appeared on the top of it, positioning themselves for a second before they tensed as a figure heaved himself upwards. First two alert, twitching cat ears appeared, shortly followed by a shock of violet and fuchsia hair. Then, slowly, they were joined by two bright golden eyes, which carefully surveyed the area. Eyes shining in satisfaction when he saw no obvious signs of guards - which was good enough for him - the figure jumped up onto the top of the hedge with all the stealth of a cat, barely resting for a second before he began to lightly scoot along it. Feeling slightly smug, he smirked to himself and twitched his pierced tail in a self-congratulating kind of way as he continued. He suddenly noticed a guard appear around a corner in front of him, much closer than he expected, and hurriedly ducked and rolled off the hedge like a gymnast, tail held out straight for balance. He landed on the pebbled ground on all fours, making as little noise as possible (which was quite a feat, with the amount of chains he had hanging off his clothes). He couldn""t be seen.

When they reached their room, Hikaru didn""t say anything. He just stood there blankly, hardened face raised to the ceiling like he was staring down some higher being, continuously curling and uncurling his trembling fists. Kaoru hovered for a second before recognising the desire to have a moment alone and saying softly, ""I""m just going to wash my face and wake myself up a bit, ""kay Hikaru?"" He took the silence as acknowledgement and wandered into their en-suite bathroom, leaving his older brother alone in their room. So, Hikaru thought bitterly, clenching his hands faster and faster until they finally stayed as tight fists, his nails digging sharply into his skin. Apparently, I""m in my room, in my house.

The mashed potatoes and chopped veggies were finished, but the corn and turkey still needed a bit longer. I set the finished food on top of the oven so it would stay warm before walking out of the kitchen again. I stood with my arms crossed, undecided how to keep myself busy and distracted. It was then that I noticed my dirty outfit. Frosting, flour, and veggie juice covered my person from head to toe. I snorted at my appearance before heading upstairs to clean up. I took a brief shower, dawdling slightly due to the soothing, warm water. Once I was all washed up, I exited the bathroom in a towel to find something presentable to wear to dinner.

It was cruel sounding, anger fueling the owner of the voice. Brandon started down the hallway, his tentative jog turning into a sprint. Before he could round the corner, though, he paused. Do you not recognize them yet? Brandon slowly peered around the corner. A tall, well-muscled, lean build teen had cornered a smaller boy with messy brown hair. The boy on top clenched his fist, and right before throwing the punch, shook his head to the left to clear his blonde hair out of his eyes. The chestnut haired boy scrambled out of the way just in time, but ran into the water fountain behind him. He snatched a look at the boys"" bathroom on the opposite wall, as if to make a run for it, but was cut off by the blonde fisting him in the jaw. With a","{""output"": ""NO""}"

His voice rose and I saw the young man in him plain as day, eager to do something new and excited at the prospect of adventure. ""Johnny listen that all sounds nice and all but all I want out of this is to get married to Peeta and settle down somewhere."" ""We can make history together Katniss. You and I."" At that I faltered a bit. ""...Sorry I must not be hearing you correctly..."" ""Leave Peeta and marry me Katniss. One of my workers is a certified minister, he can marry us. And just think how..."" His voice faded out, all I could hear was my own whirling thoughts fighting one another in my head. Johnny wants me to leave Peeta and...and what? I love Peeta! This man is fucking insane! He stepped closer to me and smiled, for the first time I noticed his entire face was lit up like the sun rising over the forest. It reached every inch of his young, wrinkle free face; it brightened his green eyes and oh my!

It was only minutes after a snowstorm, but the two couldn""t bear another moment locked inside their mansion staring at the workers putting up Christmas decorations and listening to their mother and father bicker about the guest list. They snuck out of the back servant""s entrance and made their way out to the back road, pushing the snow out of their way as they went. So they walked, their foots sinking deep into the snow with every step they took. They walked for several blocks until they were out of their privileged neighborhood and onto the normal streets. ""This is a commoners place."" Hikaru frowned as he took in his surroundings. They stood near a corner of a closed convince store with toys displayed in the window. The buildings appeared to be industrial where they built machinery but it wasn""t currently in use this time of year. ""How long do you figure till they realize we""re gone?"" Hikaru asked, his eyes locked on the white sky above them as they leaned against one of the buildings. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his twin brother shrug and sigh, the air in front of his face puffing as he spoke. ""I don""t know...hour""s maybe. Before we left I saw Mother quarreling with one of the decorators and Father was crossing off every name on the guest list that he could think of."" ""Of course."" Hikaru sighed and kicked at the snow. ""Shh!"" Kaoru stuck his hand out to stop his brother from moving and listened.

""Meet me at the breakfast table in five."" She slammed her fist on the bed and walked out. I pulled my hair into a pony tail and got dressed quickly, then sprinting down to the dining area, where Ophelia was holding a banana, a bran muffin and a breakfast smoothie. She threw them at me. ""You are to eat this for the training today. I want you to take knife wielding, spear and the shelter class today. Then, lunch will come. Then you go to first aid, archery and camouflage. Then we will have dinner, and you will sleep because we have training scores tomorrow."" I ate the banana and muffin, then sipped the smoothie down and rode the elevator into the gymnasium. It was a bright room, huge and expansive with athletic equipment. A gamemaker explained the rules to us, and we were released to the room filled with highly dangerous toys. The career tributes ran towards the mace range and the axes, while I made my way to the knives, where Haymitch was. ""Hello,"" I said, smiling and throwing the knife at the target, nailing it. ""Good,"" He said, looking at me. ""Your..."" he thought. ""you have an unusual name.... Alaqua. That it right?"" ""Yeah, you have a pretty unusual name too."" I said, throwing another knife on the bullseye. ""Yes, but I assume its not as unusual as yours,"" He snickered and threw his knife. ""It means thorny tree."" I said.

He knew that she kept her walls up most of the time. And it sounded like this guy had gotten through them and then hurt her.

I just thought... Screw what I thought. The point is that I trusted... him, and he didn""t even bother cancelling."" ""Maybe something came up,"" Mulder tried to help.

Not much she reflected. She remembered screwing up, smashing into Lycus, lying on the floor.

And she remembered the beating, at least the first part. She had finally blacked out under his fists, his boots, the blows that started as he lifted her to her feet then smashed his fist into her face, throwing her onto the floor, her wrist contorting beneath her, her world becoming blurred by the echoing pain in her face and hand.

The young woman had creamy skin topped with dark black hair tinged with streaks of red. As she twisted away, Gale got a look at her eyes - eyes as green as the trees that reigned supreme here. ""Hey!"" Gale yelled. He rushed over and tackled the lumberjack to the floor. He felt the chair go down beside them with a clatter. Roars of approval and fear went up. ""Get off me; get off me!"" the lumberjack slurred. ""What are you doing?!"" the woman screeched. ""Saving your skin,"" Gale growled with the effort, pinning his hands further into the guy""s skull. ""Relax. I""ve got this one, honey."" ""Honey?!"" All at once, Gale felt someone yanking him to his feet. Then, the cool metal of an axe""s blade against his neck.

The blade compressed further into his neck, and Gale worried she might draw blood. But, she finally let him go. ""I don""t think so.""

The others listened with interests as Fuu told her tale as vividly as her blurred memory would allow. Everyone was quiet for a while afterwards when the Wind Knight was done.

When he caught sight of Hikaru however, he realised with some alarm that the news hadn""t been taken well. Hikaru was glaring in the direction of their voices and, as his hold on Kaoru""s hand tightened, the blood all rushed to his face angrily and blemished his features.

The man in turn nodded but help up his pendulum for them to see it better. ""Now listen closely."" He said clearly. ""You will fall asleep. One, two, Jango!"" Usopp covered his eyes and looked away not noticing that Luffy fell forward down the cliff. When he heard the impact he hurried to look down only to see that said rubber boy had landed head first on the ground. ""Oh, I didn""t want to kill him yet."" The strange man said pulling his hat down a little before looing up directly at Usopp once more. ""But now there is one less person I have to deal with."" Usopp screeched as he stood up with shaky legs. Slowly he took a few steps backwards his heart racing as all his attention was on the man that watched him his pendulum swinging from side to side. With a flick of his wrist the blade was in his hands and sailing through the air. Usopp only dodged it narrowly, as it left a cut on his arm, and run away. He had to warn the village. He had to inform them. Whoever that man was he meant no well for them and if

Cheren sighed as he went into the knees. He couldn""t believe that Bel didn""t read a newspaper or watch any news. She was so often in the TV thanks to the contest she practiced in and she didn""t get any serious news. He wondered what was wrong with her sometimes. ""He was set free from the Shadow Triad, Bel. And nobody knows where he is now."" Toukos voice became sad, she looked away and Bel took a close look at her. For once she seemed to be serious again. ""Don""t worry N will be alright."" said Bel to cheer her up, she knew that Touko believed deep in her heart the same.""Yeah I know. He will be alright. I have waited so long now. I think I can wait a little more.""Toukos face was more sadly as before but still she gave her friends a small smile.""Cheren apologize to Touko.

Then, they went further and invited her to sleep in their house. They didn""t try anything perverted, and of course they didn""t tell Tamaki about it (but probably Kyoya knew everything), so it was just the three of them alone. They did not want to bug the King of the Host Club nor make fun of anyone nor take good pictures for Kyoya to sell to the best bidder; just them as the best friends they were. Haruhi, as oblivious as always, just went along and laughed with them. She wasn""t disturbed by the fact of sharing a room. Maybe she doesn""t consider us as men, said Kaoru when they thought about their possibilities. They wanted to change that. And then, at last, one day in their break at the host club when they didn""t have any customers, they chatted with her as usual, as normal as possible, until they asked what they wanted to know. ""Say, Haruhi,"" said simultaneously, ""would you go out with a host?"" It""s not that they wanted to encourage her to go out with any of them, they just wanted to know if she saw them a possible... partners? in the future. She thought a few seconds that were important while Hikaru and Kaoru were thankful that the other host were busy and weren""t listening.

""Then I""ll see you tomorrow!"" she said and turned back to fly to her homeland. ""Until tomorrow,"" he answered in a whisper, looking down to the hand that had just touched her. The day had ended so different from what he expected to. It has been a break in the routine, something new literally thrown at his face in the form of a little fairy princess. It was weird how thinking about their conversation today brought a smile to his face, and the fact that having something to look forward to from tomorrow made his chest warm. ""What do you think?"" she asked him while doing a little twirl mid-air. Marianne was currently in his throne room, the only place big enough to start her sword practice without potentially damaging anything of value in his castle. Also, everyone was currently sleeping in the Dark Forest and they didn""t want to disturb the castle""s inhabitants. Bog was the only one awake, but that wasn""t really a problem for him. His sleep schedule was so fucked up that he didn""t care when or how he slept, or even if he did. His mother always complained and lectured him about adopting a more healthy lifestyle, but in the end he still slept when his body shut down. Fortunately, that particular ability allowed him to share daylight with Marianne. They decided to meet in the afternoon until dusk so she could do her royal duties and not arise suspicions on her daily disappearances. They decided to keep their strange friendship a secret, too.

Of course he was going to win!"" ""It""s not like I have to shave my hair,"" Clint texted. ""What did you bet?"" There wasn""t even a question mark or tone, but Clint could sense Phil""s concern. ""Well, the addition is gonna be... more yellow, than expected."" The look the contractor gave Clint when he asked him to match the same shade of yellow on the addition was priceless, if Bucky""s laughter was anything to judge it by. While the contractors worked on adding an addition, Clint and Bucky kept themselves busy repairing the farm, learning how to grow vegetables and, at Kase""s urging, how to ride horses. Clint didn""t have a lot of money left, at the end of everything, but after having worked at S.H.I.E.L.D for fifteen years and storing the majority of his money under his Flint alias, his savings were definitely looking slim now. But the farm looked like a real farm. Bucky took to horse riding like a pro and Clint left him to explore the property and have time alone with his issues. Thankfully, Bucky never did ask about the names of the horses. Either he knew and that was why he hadn""t asked or he just didn""t want to know. Every night since Phil had left, they called one another. It was during one of Bucky""s horse riding trips that Clint got into his truck and drove into town, straight to the nearest jewelry shop. He bought a plain gold band and a Black Angus bull that a fellow farmer was selling for cheap. It was as mean as it looked. The farmer drove out to Clint""s place and

She can be our thread hanger for all eternity."" I struggled then, despite the burning pain in my shoulder. How had I not noticed the radiating agony from it for this long? Well it hadn""t been that long I guess. I shoved it to the side. I had a fight here, a fight to survive and not be made into a piece of rock. I wasn""t something to be collected by anyone. I heard the faint flutter of a butterfly""s wings and a shadow descended around us. ""Dean!"" I heard a distinctly familiar voice. It took me a moment before I recognized it. The suspicious man in a trench coat with soul peering abilities. I looked over towards the Winchester who had been freed from hypnosis. He glanced towards me, opened his trunk quickly and pulled out a gun of some sort. He took it, aimed and fired it towards Eurale. It was obvious she was the one in charge, and apparently the one that I had insulted. The bullet lodged itself in the center of her forehead and her head was pushed back by the force. And then she leaned forwards again, and with a horrified scream, I watched as her eyes became pure black and the bullet was forced from her skin. ""That wasn""t nice, Dean Winchester. And if you think for one minute, that I""ll forget this, you""ve got another thing","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The rest of the day was spent in a meeting with a dozen other agents including A.D. Skinner. About two hours in, Scully was leaning back in her chair, completely zoned out, when Skinner""s secretary""s voice snapped her back. ""Agent Scully, you have a phone call."" She met Mulder""s curious eyes before standing and avoiding the Assistant Director""s hard ones. ""Excuse me."" After gently closing the door behind her, she walked over to the phone on the wall. ""Line three Miss Scully."" She nodded her thanks, and picked it up. ""Agent Scully."" ""Agent Scully, this is Special Agent Blad with the VCS, are you and Agent Mulder working the kidnapping of . . . Abigail Chitwe?"" Confused, she answered. ""Yes, why?"" ""Well, today we accidentally got a letter for you, I don""t quite understand how, but it is a postcard with a landscape on the front and writing on the back. No return address."" Pause. ""What does it say?"" ""Dear Dana, you""re going to try and find her but you never will. So give up while watching the sunset glow. We are the dead."" She stared at the wall for a second. ""Can you have that sent to my office, in an envelope, I don""t want to raise any alarm."" ""Sure thing Agent Scully. And if you need any help, give me a call."" She smiled, ""Thank you."" She set the phone down; and turned around and stepped back into the room, Skinner""s office. She avoided Mulder""s probing eyes, and proceeded to her chair. As

She folded her arms and shrugged. ""An idle mind is the devil""s playground,"" Mulder said dryly. He was probably right about that. ""Well I think we""re already halfway to hell."" He smirked. ""I thought I smelled brimstone."" ""What are you doing?""' she asked. ""I got tired of picking out my suit for tomorrow""s execution. I mean meeting."" She nodded absently. ""How did this happen so quickly?"" she asked into the stilled air. He flicked the pencil hard enough that it stabbed into the ceiling with a sharp twang. It must have hit the metal below. ""I don""t know."" She looked down at her hands as silence settled between them. Letting out a sigh she moved towards her table and sorted through their mail. She could tell just looking that there were no large envelopes containing scans. She looked through it anyway. Her eyes caught on the case file open on her desk. She picked it up. Gibson""s picture was paper clipped on the front. Her shoulders sagged. ""Agents."" They both turned. Skinner walked through the door giving them a look of surprise. ""What are you doing here so late?"" ""I think we were just trying to figure that out,"" Mulder said. ""I""m glad you""re here. I need those case files on Gibson."" ""What""s going on?""Scully asked. She closed the file and handed it over. ""Due to the circumstances, there""s a late meeting on trying to gain back control over this situation with Gibson."" A heavy weight sunk in her stomach.

Jessica""s boyfriend is coming and a few other people""s significant others or what not."" Logan tried not to let his smile give away that he noticed Veronica was putting him on par with people""s boyfriends and girlfriends. He was going to just be happy with getting to join Veronica at the club for now. Veronica darted back into the bathroom to finish getting ready, and then she and Logan headed downstairs to meet Jessica. Once they were in the elevator, Logan couldn""t take it anymore. He spun Veronica against the wall and kissed her. She smiled against his lips, and he could feel it, which brought a smile to his own face. ""Logan?"" she asked as he pulled back to take a breath. ""What are you doing?"" ""This is kissing,"" he replied. ""You should be familiar with it. We""ve done it before,"" he joked, going back in for another kiss. Part of her wanted to stop him; the other part of her wanted him to never stop. She decided a compromise of allowing the kissing to continue until the elevator stopped was fair. Jessica was still waiting for them in the lobby. Logan, who was trained with good etiquette, properly introduced himself as they walked out to go to the club.

I could have been minutes, hours or days that I was there, staring unseeing at the things around me. Exhaustion long since passed and forsaken. My eyes felt gritty and dry.

A dash of light in the darkness. Jesse""s words to me before he left, echoing and bouncing off the vacant walls of my mind. Mocking and laughing at the hope that I would wake with each morning.

To feel the solid warmth of his arms encompassing me, making me feel like I""m in the safest most secure place in the world.

Samantha walked into the bathroom; grabbing one off the nearest rod, she soaked it in warm water and returned to help Scully off the floor and onto the edge of the bed.

Scully wanted to take the mask off Samantha""s face to see who had saved her. Her eyes looked so familiar. ""DANA!"" Maggie yelled for her daughter.

Maggie walked over to her daughter, taking Scully""s face in her hands. ""You both are safe now, and we will keep watching,"" Samantha said as she walked over to Melissa. ""Thank you."" Scully said, expressing her gratitude to both Samantha and Mellissa, who nodded back to Scully. ""What was that man talking about?"" Melissa walked over to Scully.

Both she and Morgana were still fully dressed so it did not matter who was there. The heavy oak creaked open as a figure in a black cape entered the room. Emeline turned to glance at her aunt before speaking to the anonymous visitor. ""Who are you? Show yourself!"" Emeline demanded. The figure turned to face her, still disguised by the shadows produced by the fire. ""My my Emeline, you have grown so since I last lain my eyes upon you,"" Mercy stated as she dropped the hood, revealing her pearl colored hair. She smiled wide, revealing perfect white teeth as she held her arms out. ""Mercy,"" Emeline breathed, tears welling in her eyes as she ran to the witch. Emeline had met Mercy many times, going on forbidden trips with her Aunt Morgana and Art to Emrys"" Kingdom to visit and the secret ones in the forest. Emeline could not remember her mother, not the smell of her hair or the porcelain of her skin, her Aunt Morgana and Mercy had been the only mothers she had ever known and it had pained her to only see her in secret.

Apparently, he didn""t like the fact that almost every day I was still asleep when he left for work. Thankfully, Charlie was unaware that my late mornings were due to late nights just sitting up talking with Edward about everything and nothing at all. I slowly rolled on to my side and peered at the illuminated numbers through half-closed lids. 7:15 I flung my body out of the bed and yelped as I hit the floor face first, not realizing that my legs were tangled up in the sheets. I muttered curses under my breath and stood up while glancing out my window. I froze. Aside from my rusty, yet reliable red pick-up, the driveway was--empty. For the first time in over a year, Edward""s silver Volvo was nowhere to be found. My mind was in a whirl, and my stomach lurched. Where was he? Perhaps he slept in? No, he doesn""t sleep.

A boy walked down to the door from the living room and put on his shoes, and heard a voice behind me say, ""Where are you going?"" a voice asked. The boy turned around to see his brother starring down with him with a smirk. The boy huffed and stood up before walking to the door and opening it.

Text2: Katniss armed with her bow at the ready silently searched for any movements. The animals would be searching for cover from the rain like they were, time was limited. She looked up in the trees and spotted a squirrel, taking it down in one smooth motion, right in the eye. After about an hour her game bag was weighed down with 3 squirrels, 2 chipmunks, and a large amount of ramps (wild leeks) she dug up. She sat to skin them, working quickly as the wind was picking up, the tops of the trees swaying above her. She was almost finished when she sensed movement to her right. Bow drawn she looked into the face of a red fox warily eyeing her from behind a tree. She was about to let her arrow fly when memories of foxface flooded into her awareness. She couldn""t do it. Instead, she cut off a piece of one of the chipmunks and threw it in the fox""s direction. The fox scurried back a few yards in surprise before curiously approaching the offering. Then, in a flash, the meat was in its teeth as it quickly departed into the woods. Katniss sighed sadly. She made quick work of the rest and headed back to Peeta. When Katniss arrived back at camp she was pleasantly surprised at what Peeta had accomplished. There was a nice think padding of leaves inside with the sleeping bag laid over it. He had a small fire going near the entrance where some rock jutted out that would hopefully shield it from most of the rain. He also had a decent pile of firewood stacked as well.

Renege stepped out and walked past him then, turned back and thanked him. He looked surprised and smiled at us. I guess that was a rare thing to happen. The same happened when we reached the door and when the maids took our stuff. After a while, we reached her surprisingly stalkerish room.

I quickly shuffled in front of her, seeing her trying to look mad, but with no avail. She quickly turned around, before I quickly ran to the other side of her, and held her down in place, by putting my hands on her shoulders. ""...Jerk."" she muttered.

She wanted to live as long as she could...just so she could have happiness. ""Damn it..."" she cursed to herself, stopping in her place. She glanced up at where she was at. Was it strange that she was in front of Gekkoukan High School? Plugging her red earphones into her ears, she set her mp3 player on shuffle. Whenever she was even near this school, she always had to play a song. It was practically a theme song of what ever was going on at the moment. Her mp3 player was packed was various songs that were recommended by her by some of her other friends, like Rio or Saori, or some songs she basically liked.

It was strapless and came down in a ""v"". The hem was just above her knees and it was straight black. ""Boots and her hair up a little."" I said. Isabelle nodded and helped her do her hair. I rummaged through her other dresses and picked up one. ""Can I wear this one?"" She eyed it and nodded, ""It""ll look good on you."" I smiled and went to change. I came back out and spun for them. They both seemed impressed. The dress was silver. The longer side, the right, ended just below my knees and the shorter side ended just above. I pulled my hair into a side ponytail and curled it slightly. My bangs were curled too. ""Shoes?"" Isabelle asked. I debated, ""Two-inch stilettos?"" She nodded and handed me the silver heels. I put them on and Isabelle got dressed too. It didn""t take her long. We joined the boys and all three seemed impressed. Clary and Jace stared at each other. The boys did look good in their suits. Alec took his sister""s arm and led her down the sidewalk. Simon took Clary""s arm and Jace offered me his. ""Tell me you aren""t like Isabelle and go places without a weapon."" Jace said with a worried look. I smiled and shook my head, ""I always have my daggers on me."" He eyed me. I lifted the longer part of the skirt to show him where the two daggers were strapped to my thigh. ""Always prepared."" He nodded in appreciation. It didn""t take us too long to get to Magnus Bane""s house. Isabelle knocked and showed the invitation.

He replied. She just looked at him and he looked away. Crowfeather sat up and beckoned his apprentice over to him, ""We""ll take Puffball and Icron to RiverClan territory."" Onestar and Jayfeather looked at Crowfeather and then at each other. ""Sounds good to us."" Alse said. She wrapped her tail around Ilce""s paw and stood up. Sandstorm and Brambleclaw stood up beside the exit and Cloudtail smacked Jayfeather and they both stepped toward the exit. ""Come on Ilce."" Alse said following Jayfeather and Cloudtail outside. The two she-cats followed happily and willingly. The boys and Puffball watched them leave. Puffball and Icron followed a few minutes later with Heatherpaw and Crowfeather. When they left Arson got up and asked, ""Where will I sleep?"" Onestar pointed out a small indent in the back wall. It was big enough for Arson to sleep in. ""Thank you Onestar."" He went and lay down to sleep. On the other hand Crowfeather was having a hard time keeping Puffball and Icron in line with Heatherpaw. ""Will you two settle down!"" They both stopped and walked silently between Heatherpaw and Crowfeather. When they got to RiverClan territory Dawnflower, Leopardstar, and her Deputy Mistyfoot were waiting for them. ""Hello Crowfeather,"" Leopardstar said, ""Are these the rouges Whitewing and Brightheart came and told us about?"" ""Yes."" Crowfeather said, ""Take care of them. We may need them later."" Mistyfoot and Dawnflower flanked the rouges and the three she-cats led them into their territory. Crowfeather had to drag Heatherpaw away from the border. ""BYE!""

Good night, you two."" I dragged my feet along the sidewalk by myself the next morning to school. Alya had to go ahead of me to meet with the principal about the school newspaper, leaving me to walk on my own today. The walk there seemed lonelier than I remembered. It was only a few minutes away from my house, but it felt like an eternity just to get to one end of the street. Maybe if I actually lifted my feet off the ground, I could get to school on time. I pull myself up the stairs of the school where some of my classmates are still chatting outside. I swing my backpack off my shoulders when I get closer to my locker and put some books inside for later. ""Hey, Marinette, do you have a second?"" My locker almost shuts on my fingers from an outside source. That outside source happened to be Sabrina, Chloe""s top lackey. ""What do you want?"" I asked more bitterly than I would have liked to.

But, that was part of his charm. ""You should take a hint from your senpai and be more cheerful,"" I said to the twins. They glared at me and sat in the grass. This was normal and not scary at all, considering I was older and more mature, if I do say so myself. However, when I got daggers sent to me by Kyoya, I felt a bit scared for my life. ""Let""s play catch, Tama-chan!"" the small blonde boy begged. Mori walked across the field to have his own area. I smiled and took the frisbee out of the bag. I threw it towards the smaller senpai would had to jump high to catch it. His karate spirit really showed when he did a spinning kick in the air and threw the disc to Mori-senpai before returning to the ground. The taller boy caught it one-handed without even looking at it. Whenever he does cool stuff like that, I wonder if he""s secretly an alien ninja or something. He swung his arm and released the frisbee, making it fly in my direction. Since I""ve never taken any form of martial arts, my jump was pitiful and the disc continued to glide in the air over my head and behind me. ""I""ll get it!"" I said once it landed on a hill behind me. I turned on my heel and dashed for the hill. The disc was pretty far, considering how hard the throw was. It was on the very top and away from my friends.

""I will never surrender!"" Murtagh yelled, and then did what only a desperate, but mostly hungry, foe would do. He bit Domick on the arm. Domick pulled his arm away with an exclamation of pain, giving Murtagh that brief moment to escape. And escape he did. He switched places with Domick, and it was Murtagh who now pinned him to the ground, making sure to keep his arms a safe distance away from his friends mouth. ""You bit me,"" Domick said in shocked anger. ""I can""t believe you bit me, you little..."" Domick kneed him in the stomach and tried to force Murtagh off of him, using all of his strength.

It was Sunday afternoon and the restaurant painted a busy but high-classed picture with its well-dressed patrons and mellow decorations. Waiters and waitresses in dainty black suits flurried around quietly, ready to provide any kind of service wished by the guests. Unfortunately, she reflected, these goings-on lay at the other side of the door while she was here, shut inside a private chamber with her friends. Such occasion might be perfectly all right a few months ago, but now, with none of her companies speaking or smiling, it was pure torture. The atmosphere inside the room could only be described as hostile. There were others like her who felt merely uncomfortable - Honey-senpai, and possibly Mori-senpai although the slight frown on his face didn""t say much - but the rest were busy holding a glaring contest with each other across the circular table they were sitting around. Hikaru was the closest to a winner with his angry blazing eyes and equally angry features - Haruhi remembered that the only time she had ever seen him that angry was when he had heard about but Kyouya-senpai""s engagement.

His consolation, but also his own personal hell.

Most of all, he was just thankful that Bucky might have found someone to be happy with. He might have been old and old-fashioned, but he knew his best friend well. Every time he visited Bucky, after Gear had left, Bucky wouldn""t stop talking about Gear. He asked questions. He told Steve what had happened that day. Today, however, he said the thing that Steve had been suspicious of for a while now. ""I think... I think I""m falling for her- hard Steve... ' However, Tony had called him to the security room.

Text2: Denver was a large city, being the most populated in Colorado, and it briefly reminded Danielle of New York, or perhaps even Chicago. People were everywhere and anywhere, ignoring Danielle as she looked up at the buildings. It""s so cool, she thought with glee and a small bounce in her jump. Where should she go first? A restaurant? A movie theater? After pick pocketing a few of the people that had already shoved their way past her, she figured she had enough to do either of those things, or maybe even both? As she continued walking through the city, she couldn""t help but feel like someone was watching her. She pulled the hood of her hoodie up and moved a bit quicker. No matter how fast she moved, she could still feel the eyes. Her ghost sense never went off, so it couldn""t possibly be a ghost. Unless maybe it was Vlad watching her from cameras. Paranoia nipped at her mind and she frantically looked at any and all cameras nearby. There were many of them; they looked as though they were looking away from her direction, but she couldn""t help but feel like they were still watching her. She quickened her pace again until finally it was a full-blown run. She had to find a place to hide, a place to transform. Somewhere where she could turn invisible and flew away. She ran with her head down and didn""t stop until someone grabbed her arm and pulled her away from an oncoming car. ""Whoa there,"" said a fruity feminine voice, their tone slightly deep and strong. Danielle yanked her arm out of the grip quickly as she turned to face the stranger. The woman in front of her reminded her briefly of Jazz- same age, same eye color. However,","{""output"": ""YES""}"

From previous part: In other words, I was still awake when, around 1am, Jesse suddenly appeared. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~ He didn""t notice I was awake though.

It""s like... he didn""t make a sound, and I didn""t see him, or feel a disturbance in the air or anything, and it""s not his smell... I just sort... Well, it sounds absurd. So absurd I""m not even going to bother saying it out loud. Anyway, so after he appeared, all I had to do was peak through my lashes to reassure myself that I wasn""t making stuff up. I wasn""t. Nope, he was there. Like always, he looked stunningly hot. The stars were giving him a sort of bluish glow, and combined with his ghost glow, which is more of a whitish-silverish, it was gorgeous. But let""s face it, Jesse""s always gorgeous. So I kept breathing deeply, you know, pretending to be asleep. You""re wondering why I didn""t take him up on the fact that he was obviously avoiding me, aren""t you? Well, I had a couple of reasons: 1. I didn""t want to wake up the whole house yelling at him; 2. I was sure if I tried I would choke up and start crying but mostly, 3. I was curious. I mean, what was he doing in my room at one in the morning?

Text2: I stood in the shadows, watching, waiting. As a wolf hunts his prey, I watched her. I could hardly stand the wait for the kill, to feel her warm cunt beneath my hands, cleansing that part of my soul that craved the essence of innocence, the blood of the pure. I felt that if I could just get my hands on her, make her love me as I loved her, I would be complete. I would take her into me, she would become a part of me, and then, then victory would be in my grasp at last. After all this time, sitting in the cold silence under the gaze of the water-crest moon, in the hands of the mist and the comforting mattress of leaves on which I crouched like a gargoyle night after night, I began to feel that I deserved perhaps another handsome reward, something more than her delicious pussy. True, just having her in my hands would be the sweetest moment of my life, but I needed something more solid, more concrete, so that I could look at it in my old age and say to myself, ""Ah, yes, the Red-Haired Goddess, my greatest victory."" And then the memories would come flooding back to me as I lay in my bed, lulling me to sleep and bringing the sweetest dreams to my mind. Yes, yes I would take a trophy from this beauty. And as I watched, wondering what I could possibly take that would sum up all these years of waiting and gazing, I saw the man come into her building. I never knew his name-I didn""t know hers, either, at that point-but I had seen them together so many times that I was certain they were a couple...or at least fucking.

I gently probed the area, making sure it wasn""t actually broken. ""You""re right."" I told her. ""It""s just a sprain. Do you have anything we could wrap it up with?"" I tried to think about what I had on my person to bind her ankle. ""I have a bandanna in my pocket."" I quickly reached for it, silently giving her credit for bringing one. Wraping the bandanna tightly around her ankle I asked her to stand. When she took a few steps without more evident pain I was surprised. Normally, people with sprains could only walk with the help of someone else. I thought nothing of it and told her to go slowly, heading back to the cabbin. When we were about halfway there, I finally heard her whimper slightly agter having to take a big step to avoid a big mud puddle. ""Lo sabia,"" I muttered under my breath. I put my arm around her waist and carried most of her weight. ""Jesse! what are you doing? Let me go!"" When I didn""t oblige she started strugling, making it worse. Sighing impatiently, I held on tighter to her waist and bent down to scoup up her legs. ""I""m stopping you from hurting that ankle even more. You""re a sneaky one querida."" Wait. Did I just call her that?It slipped out. I ment to say Susannah. Luckily, she""s too angry to notice I""d called her anything other than that.

I was drunk on his taste, intoxicated by the feel of his lips on mine. It was a sensation I wanted to live in forever. He hands moved upwards to cup my breasts, then he flicked his thumbs across the nipples, already hard peaks even through my bra and shirt. He kneaded my flesh gently, alternating that motion with another pass of his thumbs. Each touch sent a flash of heat, of pleasure, through my body, to my core. Trailing his hands down my body once again, he rested them on my hips, hesitating slightly. He broke the kiss then, and just looked at me, his gaze burning into my soul. Our breath, heavy with passion, mingled between us as we stared at each other. Desire, passion, and love filled his eyes, the most enchanting of emotional kaleidoscopes. His hands danced lower, and gasped in surprise when he moved his hands behind my thighs, lifting me off the ground. I laughed, having no choice but to lock my legs around his waist, my arms around his neck. I touched my forehead to his as he pressed me against the wall. Contact with that solidness settled him fully against me, and the feeling of him resting between my thighs was a perfection my dreams had never done justice to. I moaned at the heady thought that there were still barriers between us, and that what was to come was going to be even more spectacular. I loved the freedom of being able to touch him, the joy of knowing I could possess his body, the splendor of being sure I already ruled his heart. I kissed him again, replacing want with","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Rin, the first person that he cared for more than a friend, and more than family. He knew his feelings for him, but had never acted on them. He had only slowed Rin down, and had been the reason he couldn""t move forward. He needed to do this, he needed to allow all of them to move forward. He needed to stop depending on them. Sure, he knew that they would grieve for him a little, but over time they would forget. Then, they""d be able to move on. Without him to interfere in their lives. A sudden flash of lightening blinded him for a moment, and for a moment he thought that he had heard someone call his name. He looked around, but saw no one. Giving a small shrug, he glanced back to the river, and gave a sigh as he saw that it was much stronger now. He knew that there was no way he could swim against the tide, and he started for the water. For once, he didn""t reach for his clothes, and instead kept them on as he slowly approached the rushing water. Another flash of lightening blinded him again, but he merely followed the sound of the rushing water. ""...ruka!"" His steps hesitated ever so slightly, before resuming his pace. He knew that no one knew he was there. They wouldn""t even think to look here. He was so close to the water, just a few steps from it. Another step, and the water was brushing against the tip of his shoe. He looked down, watching the water brush quickly against his shoe, and then took another step. This time, his foot hit into

""It is good to know that you can still talk though. I thought that I""d never get to hear the lovely voice that went with the cute girl."" He laughed, and she jabbed him in the ribs softly, as she rested her head against his chest. She was glad that she had found her voice as well. Giving a sigh, she leaned back and stared up at him. ""More memories surfaced as well. Suzushima was...one of my more...stubborn friends. The moment he figured...that something was dangerous...to be around he""d...refuse to allow me near it.

""Giving your fiancee a call, obviously."" Ceil humphed. Due to their hectic schedule this month, Sebastian was never able to give his new fiancee a call for the past few weeks. Maybe a text of two, he recalls, but never really a proper conversation with her since the few days after their engagement. ""Do you know what time it is, young master?""

I was actually preparing myself for the worst after that pamphlet fiasco."" Ignoring her friendly jab at his ego he replied in good humor ""Indeed. To be honest, I""m not quite like this with other people."" Erik paused. What had he just said? ""Not like this with other people""? Why did he say that? Did he want her to have the wrong idea?

""Yeah that stupid game,"" said Haruhi, folding her arms over her chest. ""What, have you got a problem with it Haruhi?"" the twins asked. ""Not really.

I look up from my feet that have been scuffing along the gravel pavement and see a big, ruff mountain of a peacekeeper standing at the girls 12 year old section that looks alert and focused.

It was not the light that had awakened him; by his internal clock it was time, and so he rose. As silent as a breath of wind, he then slipped out of the room. Padding lightly down the steps, he turned and followed a darkened corridor. The lack of light didn""t seem to affect him, either; without need for a guiding handhold, he strode onward confidently. His eyes glittered cat-like in the gloom, milky-white like twin moons. Finally he reached his destination: the front door. Expert hands flitted over the lock, then he paused to listen for any noise in the household. Once outside, he exhaled the breath he had been holding, a puff of fog hovering by his face. He stood a moment facing the house, as though gathering himself, one hand on the door handle, the other clenching a navy bandana. Slowly, he released his vice grip on the handle, reaching up to set the band on his forehead. He tucked the ends under a mane of long hair, swiftly tying them. Once satisfied with the secure tightness of the bandana round his head, he turned and blinked in the flood of warm sunlight. It caressed his tired features and danced in his pale eyes. He stepped off the porch, taking in his surroundings. A vast field descended to the receding shadows of the woodland forest that bordered

Then, they went further and invited her to sleep in their house. They didn""t try anything perverted, and of course they didn""t tell Tamaki about it (but probably Kyoya knew everything), so it was just the three of them alone. They did not want to bug the King of the Host Club nor make fun of anyone nor take good pictures for Kyoya to sell to the best bidder; just them as the best friends they were. Haruhi, as oblivious as always, just went along and laughed with them. She wasn""t disturbed by the fact of sharing a room. Maybe she doesn""t consider us as men, said Kaoru when they thought about their possibilities. They wanted to change that. And then, at last, one day in their break at the host club when they didn""t have any customers, they chatted with her as usual, as normal as possible, until they asked what they wanted to know. ""Say, Haruhi,"" said simultaneously, ""would you go out with a host?"" It""s not that they wanted to encourage her to go out with any of them, they just wanted to know if she saw them a possible... partners? in the future. She thought a few seconds that were important while Hikaru and Kaoru were thankful that the other host were busy and weren""t listening.

In the split second it took for you to come here, a great battle raged between me and Herobrine over your memories. Herobrine wanted you to forget your fighting skills, indeed, how to do the most basic of things such as walking, so that you would be useless to me. He scattered your memories far across Minecraftia, along with the tools that you shall need for overthrowing him."" Just then, a breathtaking scene flourished around us, of great forests of trees, stretching as far as the eye could see, there were also deserts of extreme heat, with green stalks of cactus like green sentinels, and more deserts but punishingly cold, small furry beings running playfully through them, vast oceans of a blue liquid called water and under all of this was the crude, unforgiving realm of the Nether, and far below that was the eternal jail of the End, where Herobrine ruled in the form of a black dragon of darkness. Me and Notch ourselves were on a great system of islands far above all of this, in Notches great castle of light. Notch continued: ""You see before you all of Minecraftia, somewhere in the whole of it there lies 5 objects, along with them 5 memories. You must find them. I have already given you the first memory, of basic things you have learnt in school. Now I give you a sword, second only to my own. Its name is Inconstans, after its ability, which is that it will morph into whatever tool you require."" At that Notch unsheathed a great sword. It was about 3 foot long and an inch wide, curved slightly at the end. It was made of an entirely clear stone, and

Finnick was practically worshiped in the Capitol, and if the President had him executed, that information would leak, and once the people of the city knew about his death, who knew what would happen? So, we came to the conclusion that, like Peeta, he isn""t dead, but at the same time, he isn""t really able to live his life. The girl back in his district, Annie Cresta, was said to have a meltdown when she learned of his demise. We did know about what happened to Haymitch, though. Once he was able to recover from the crash, and could stand and walk on his own, he was taken to one of the many stockades around the city. Eventually, I guess, Snow gave him an appearance as well, and demanded, then forced him to accept the role of Head Gamemaker for years to come. I think I knew why, out of all the potential applicants, he picked Haymitch to run their ""show"" from now on. The President knew how the Games had a lasting effect on my mentor, and in order to inflict as much mental pain as possible, he placed him back into his nightmares. The nightmares that, after his game, destroyed everyone and everything he had ever known.

Another dream, this time I was me in my own body, no longer a stinking rat, or was I in my own body when I was the rat. Yes I am a rat, and my dream is coming again just to torture me, to remind me, that I am and always will be the rat. It was the Reaping, not the Reaping that had happened about a week ago, but the Reaping that had happened a year ago. I wanted to finish my dream just to get to the part where I saw Pirty, so I could tell him sorry, but I woke up. The sound that woke me up was that of rustling wings. Mockingjays. I was alone, all alone, but I was okay because I had told them to leave. I knew that I told them to leave me, but I wanted them to know that I was okay, I was racking my brain trying to remember how it went, and then it came to me. I tried to whistle, but the first time a lot of blood and spit flew out of my mouth. I emptied my mouth of all the blood, and tried to sit up, but the knife that had stabbed me was still stuck, so I pulled it out. I sat up, and whistled the short tune that Rue had taught me, but it wasn""t loud enough, so I tried again louder this time, and I waited, and then I heard it again and again, louder and louder.

Text2: Three years ago, a brilliant minecrafter and skilled fighter named Connor came across a mysterious cave system. Filled with cracks of burning hot lava, Connor explored. He found a mysterious pool of blue bubbling liquid. As he admired the cave, Connor was pushed into the liquid. He sank through the boiling substance, and awoke at a small room. A collection of books were found. Connor read through these, and found that this room had been created by Arkenzene, a king of sorts. Connor also found special weapons and armor. Marvelous works of art. Connor decided to experiment with these, finding that they also had special abilities, all related to fire and molten rock. He became a bounty hunter, finding the most dangerous people, and killing them. As he honed his skills, he found that he could summon powers as well. Using these powers, Connor made a life for himself, using his brilliant mind and special gear to become one of the best bounty hunters in Minecraftia. Little did he know that he would find the true reason he had found what he did, and what role he was meant to play. Hello.

Possibly this was the reason he gave him that pleasure. He went over to get a cup of coffee and noticed shaking legs from under the table. Out of curiosity of which one it was this time He pulled up the table cloth. ""Oh hello."" He mused at the seven year old under the table. ""Squee!"" Came a high pitched squeak. Jhonen sighed.

The bartender stared at him for a moment, taking in his features. Messy dark brown hair, almost burnt looking, flashing blue eyes that reminded him of the night sky, slightly brown skin, a sort of tan look, and he seemed to be wearing a really old travelling robe and a pair of travelling boots that looked very worn out.

Chapter 19: I force mi descindiente (my decendant)- Basically when ulquiorra died, he turned into ashes, not because of ichigo""s zanpakuto, but because of the injuries that he sustained when figting ichigo as a vasto lorde. Also, when he died, he died with regrets. So, this is twist/theory: because ulquiorra died this way, he left an ""imprint"" or ""echo"" for someone else to convey to orihime. Since all the hollows were once human, it is resonable to imagine that ulquiorra has living descendants left on earth. Maverick is ulquiorra""s last living descendant, and that was why he kept having those ""siezures"" in pervious chapters: he""s basically ""seeing"" ulquiorra""s last/most impacting memories.

He came over and sat on the edge of the bed next to Ciel. He placed a gloved hand on Ciel""s. Ciel looked up at Sebastian with slight terror in his eyes. Small tears formed in the corners of his mismatched eyes. Sebastian pulled Ciel into a tight embrace. ""You don""t have to keep it, my father can take care of it right now."" Sebastian murmured to the crying boy. Ciel thought of his Aunt. She always wanted a child, and she couldn""t stand it when people terminated their pregnancies. What a horrible thing to do to his Aunts memory if he got rid of his child. ""No... I want to keep it."" Ciel said quietly through his tears. Sebastian kissed the boy""s forehead lightly. ""As you wish my lord."" Sebastian said. Ciel buried his face in Sebastian""s coat and continued to cry/ He ended up crying himself to sleep. Sebastian gingerly tucked him into bed and left the room. Sebastian leaned against the closed door. A man walked up to Sebastian. ""Lucifer, you know the boy won""t survived child birth."" The man said. Sebastian looked down, avoiding eye contact with the mas standing in front of him. ""I know father."" Sebastian said glumly. ""Is there anything at all I can do to save

She muttered, refusing to look up from the spot on the ground she was staring at. ""I don""t even care about myself; I just can""t believe I did this to him."" She breathed. ""Whoa whoa whoa, wait; do this to whom? I thought you said you didn""t know who you went home with that night."" Alya said as she shoved the pregnancy test back into its box. Marinette""s face turned a brilliant shade of red; of course she knew who she slept with that night, but there really wasn""t a reason to tell Alya until now. ""Well Mari, spill, who was it? Oh man I really wish I had paid attention to who you left with that night."" She said, trying to think back on all of the people they went out with. ""Was it Nathanael?"" She asked, remembering how he had such a huge crush on Marinette in high school. ""Oh god no."" Marinette said quickly, her face turning an even brighter shade of red. ""Nathanael is still such a super sweet boy and all but I don""t think I could ever do something like that with him, drunk or not."" She said as she pulled her phone from her pocket. She hoped that she could distract Alya enough to keep her from pushing too much to find out who the father was. He and she had been talking pretty consistently since the night they slept together, so she shot him a text saying they really needed to talk.

I snorted in my head. I didn""t care where he was as long as he was out of my life. I felt hands grabbing my shoulders. I looked and there was Ian, in tears shaking me like I was about to die or something. ""O god"" he muttered. He grabbed my face and traced it with his hands.

Text2: ""So, what did you and I talk about last night?"" In the car with Mulder the morning after what Scully was starting to think of as the unofficial Most Embarrassing Night of Her Life, there was no question she felt less like answering. Well all right, there was one question she felt less like answering, and she had a feeling it was on her partner""s list of follow-up questions. They didn""t have a long drive ahead of them, only a few minutes from work to her apartment - they had driven Mulder""s car back to Washington from Martinsburg, where they had dropped Van Blundht off in cuffs - so hopefully she""d be able to dodge his curiosity long enough to close her apartment door and put Mulder on the other side of it. However, as she looked over at her partner in the driver""s seat, she saw a smirk crossing his face that meant he would not just let this one drop. ""Come on, Scully, you were happy to tell me last night, and it wasn""t even really me!"" ""I know that, Mulder,"" she sighed, tossing her hair out of her eyes, where it blew right back in the wind whipping through the partially-open window. She refused to close it entirely, unwilling to relinquish the feeling of the breeze on her face. ""I just ... I just told him about one time at prom when we had to leave the dance in a fire truck."" Mulder let the silence hang, seemingly waiting, before finally giving her an exasperated look that she felt rather than saw. ""Scully,"" he said, ""you""re telling me that that is exactly the story you told this guy and he loved it enough that he was gonna kiss you for it?"" Had Scully been a weaker woman","{""output"": ""NO""}"

I watch as Frosty pulls up a hand to nervously scratch the back of his head. I could tell he knew the woman wasn""t going to appreciate what came out of his mouth next. ""Ah Levy, I would like you to meet Lucy. She""s your new roommate according to Erza."" The blue haired woman doesn""t even turn her head to acknowledge me but gives frosty a sharp look. ""What is Ezra thinking? She already knows because of the boys it""s already way too crowded in here."" Hearing the angry ginger was irritating yet another person with her callous decisions hadn""t surprised me in the slightest. The strong willed woman tended to do what she wanted despite other""s objections. Frosty shakes his head as he slides his hands into his pockets. Speaking with a cool demeanor. ""Hey don""t shoot the messenger, this is all Erza""s decision. I told her the same thing.....but you know how stubborn she can get."" The blue haired woman catches me off guard while listening in on their exchange. She gives me a smile with a questionable look on her face. ""Lucy is it?"" Raising a hand to my red faux glasses as I nervously nod my head. ""Give me a minute. Okay?"" She holds out a finger while sweetly asking before a gush of wind suddenly blows back in my face with the door swinging closed. Suddenly a woman""s voice comes blasting out from the other side of the door. Followed by hurried fumbling feet and sudden crashing sounds.

I stretch and step out of bed to get showered and dressed and Peeta goes across the hall to his room. I dress in simple khaki pants and a green t-shirt, and then I tie my hair up in its usual braid. When I come out of my room I see Effie flapping her arms around in the living room. Today is going to be a fun day obviously. ""There you are Katniss. I need you to practice your stance and what you are going to say in the interview. Oh and your surprise face when Peeta asks you to marry him."" I nod and let Effie drag me around to where she needs me. Haymitch laughs behind me. ""I see your still as charming as a dead slug, sweetheart."" I glare at him.

Text2: Zoeya was a non-stop chatterbox and talked my weary ears off as she began to whip up something. My eyelids felt like large gold slabs were placed in my eyelids as I half-tried to listen and sleep. I was slowly falling unconscious as time was passing excruciatingly slow. The welcoming tendrils of sleep almost incased me but the sounds of barking makes me groggily blink open my eyes. The once quiet atmosphere suddenly gets very loud with the overlapping sounds of talking, shouting, and an animal""s annoyed cry. I felt the poor animal""s pain. I heard the grunts and angry tone of someone trying to drag something toward the parlor. ""Come on, Teep!"" A majestically smooth but firm voice yelled. ""You got to go outside; your not pulling that stunt again!"" My head pounds but my heart starts to pound along with it. That voice sounds so silky, like butter on bread. It""s a rare sort of voice that makes me want to hear the person behind it moan my name and hit those perfect notes of his. I let out a grunt of frustration. I""m in the midst of a terrible hangover and the start of a cold. And now, to top the sunday with a cherry; I""m horny. Wonderful. I flinch harshly as I sense someone roughly push against the couch. I open my mouth to say something but man sighs in defeat and sits on top of the sofa. Oh my god, he""s hot and wicked tall. ""Hey Rythian, you""re finally up!"" Zoeya turns briefly around to wave to the man. The name adds angry butterflies to my stomach. He twists around to reply but his mouth hangs open as his eyes drift down to meet my blank look.

215,"Text1: I ate dinner slowly that night. I was dreading having to go to sleep. I didn""t want to even face the walk outside the cabin towards the little tent that was to be our only shelter. Eventually I had no choice. It was well past ten o""clock and I had to face the darkness. I stood at the door to the cabin and stared outside with dread. I knew that everyone inside was staring at me. But that didn""t matter to me. All that mattered was that I was terrified to even take one single step. In the end it was Mykel that helped me once more. He walked around me and held out his hand without hesitation. I didn""t think twice about the gesture. I took his hand and he led me carefully outside into the darkness. He didn""t make a sound the entire way to the tent...even when I gripped his hand so hard it must have hurt. As soon as we were safely inside the tent our hands parted. I couldn""t see his eyes...but I knew instinctively that he was waiting for me to climb into my sleeping bag. He was protecting me in ways that no one else ever had before. I was lying in my bag for quite a while before I heard his voice softly speaking to me. His words were so soft that I had to strain to hear him. ""Dani...do you ever wonder if maybe this isn""t the only life we""ve lived? I mean maybe we knew each other in a past life and that""s why we""re the way we are with each other."" I knew he couldn""t see me...but he had to have heard my gasp of surprise. It took a few moments for me to actually respond. ""Mykel...I don""t know

Your parents would be proud of you and so are we."" Will sniffed a bit at the mention of his deceased parents. ""Thanks,"" he said shyly. And after another round of hugs, they were off to the airport and headed back to DC. - Only slightly more awake by the time Monica pulled the car into the parking lot the Cheyenne Regional Airport, Scully hoped the small airport had some type of cafe past security. Otherwise she knew she""d end up falling asleep the moment she sat down again. After she and Will had unloaded their bags from the trunk of the car, Scully felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck. ""Have a good flight, Dana. Tell Mulder hello for me."" Scully set her bags down and returned Monica""s hug. ""I will. Take care, Monica."" The last day had reaffirmed her faith in her friend""s good intentions and kind heart. Monica released Scully and walked over to Will. She held her arms open and he gave her a shy smile as he rubbed the back of his neck. Scully watched as Monica leaned down as she gripped William in a tight hug. She thought she saw her whisper something in his ear because Will smiled and nodded his head. ""Ready to go?"" Scully asked and held William""s duffel bag out to him. He took his bag from her and hoisted it on his shoulder. Scully turned to address Monica. ""I""ll call you in a few day after I have a better idea of how Mulder""s recovery is going go.""

216,"Text1: ""Mom,"" Scully turned to Maggie who had been standing beside her. She spoke in an soft, almost inaudible tone. ""I don""t know if I""m comfortable with my partner staying with us."" Scully admitted with a brief sigh. It was obvious she had been exhausted. The way she spoke, the bags under her eyes. When was the last time she had gotten a good night""s sleep? She couldn""t even think back that far. Had it really been that long? ""Why not? He needs somewhere to stay, Dana. We""re doing the man a favor."" ""I know mom, it""s just, I thought it was going to be just you and I."" Scully looked down toward the floor, unsure as to what to say. Mulder had been in the living room, isolated. Who knew what he had been doing. Hopefully not throwing pencils at the ceiling for entertainment. ""I love you."" Maggie paused. ""We""ll find time to spend together, don""t worry. I know it."" Maggie embraced Scully and smiled softly. Scully returned the smile then nodded. She looked toward the direction the living room was in, and turned her eyes toward Maggie. ""I should say something to him."" Scully entered the living room slowly with her arms dangling by her sides. Mulder was seated on the couch, looking around the living room, trying to find something to catch his interest. The room was quiet. Not a single sound. ""Mulder..."" Scully began to speak as she walked toward the couch. ""I""m sorry."" Scully""s tone was still hush, soft, inaudible. She meant her apology. What had happened earlier between the two was rough. Mulder""s hazel eyes shot up, looking into Scully""s. At that moment their eyes met, he could feel a connection. A different kind of connection. One he had never felt before. But what was

""What was that?"" he asked, meaning the mediation-gone-wrong that he had just been dragged into. Okay, so Paul wanted an explanation, this was good; it meant that I might get away with it. Either that or I""d make things ten times worse. Hmm, how should I answer this? ""It was... a ghost."" Hey, good start! ""You can tell because of the glow-"" ""Suze."" ""Okay, okay, I""m sorry!""

Ah, there""s the Paul we all know and... something... not love... because that would just be wrong. Whatever, I was safe now, it seemed. I could relax and annoy Paul as much as I wanted.

""Right I""m a jerk,"" he said, ""one who just saved you from getting your head smashed open."" Um, I might have forgotten to mention that earlier. ""Cause, yeah, Paul was right.

Doggett asked in a bitchy manner ""Oh well be like that, no wonder nobody likes you and you have no friends"" she said in anger ""Grrrrrrrrrrr"" he yelled, Scully was petrified as he jumped up with an angered expression, he ran toward the door and sprinted out like a shot.

But Aya saw a smirk creep across his shadowed face. And she blamed herself. If she hadn""t been so naive, so awkwardly honest all the time, and so desperate for him... And now he was thinking she wasn""t serious. ""You bastard..."" she breathed disbeleivingly, shaking her head in disgust. His head shot up at the sound of it. ""What are you looking so surprised for?"" she asked, though her voice was shaking and so was she. ""Everyone has their limits, you know."" She looked at him straight in the eye. She didn""t care if he saw her crying. ""You- you don""t even care, d-do you?"" she stammered. ""I""m being serious!"" Defeaning silence filled the air. The only sound was the wind whistling a tune and the soft rustling of leaves on the ground. Aya kept her eyes on him, she watched him with as much intensity as she could muster, because this time, his eyes were set on her and her alone. After what seemed like hours of this, after the season seemed to do another full round, he spoke. ""But do you still love me?"" he asked once again, only a touch of urgency was detected. Aya tried to empty herself of emotion, but she failed. Should she be hopeful? Should she be disappointed? Should she care at all?

Ginny leaned down and kicked her brother. ""Ow!"" Ginny smiled sweetly. More names were called. ""Cedron, Lynx!"" The girl named Lynx stepped out of the crowd, arms crossed. Her hair was midnight blue, her eyes a lighter midnight blue. Her hair was lower than her shoulder, but not much.

Peeta comes in looking like he always does, with the sweet scent of sugar and cinnamon coming of him. He sat down on the couch next to me and smiled. ""So... how was the doctors?"" Peeta asked with concern in his voice. I nodded ""Fine."" I say, knowing I am going to have to break the news soon. ""And?"" He motions his hands to get me to talk. ""I""m pregnant."" I blurt. Smooth Katniss... Just blurt it out. Another tear slips down my face and I start to cry. Peeta knitted his eyes together and put his hand on my face to wipe my tears away. He smirked and said ""Why are you crying?"" By then I was sobbing","{""output"": ""NO""}"

""Idiot!"" he hissed, missing the regretful sigh behind him. ""If you wake Yuzu, I""ll skin you alive!"" Isshin mumbled something that wasn""t understandable due to his mouth being full of carpet threads. Rukia walked by the doorway, then backtracked, frowning. """"Nii-sama?"" she asked. ""What are you doing here?"" ""I was waiting for you to get home,"" Byakuya answered softly, glancing worriedly at Yuzu only to see she""d awoken and was watching Ichigo and her father""s display worriedly. ""Ichigo,"" he snapped, gaining the boy""s attention. ""Your sister."" Ichigo gave Isshin another kick and was then at his sisters side. ""Go back to sleep, Yuzu,"" he whispered. ""Okay,"" she muttered. ""Ichi-nii? Will you cuddle with me? I""m cold,"" she said. He nodded and turned to the others with a glare. ""Out. All of you.

Rukia let out an ""eep"" before darting out the door, dragging Isshin with her. Byakuya glanced at Ichigo, then nodded and sat in one of the now empty chairs. Yuzu reached out a hand and he blinked, looking unsure of what to do. ""Take it,"" Ichigo ordered as he climbed into the bed as his sister had asked.

It was far too much work to govern that many people and anyway, he couldn""t see his brother actually doing what he told him to do without a mass amount of brainwashing, some gum and a bit of PVC pipe. But it was his reputation at stake, his livelihood, and so he commenced his plan. If all else failed, he""d make sure Joker got some PVC pipe from the Home Depot down the road. Anyway, said plan involved a lot of patience. And a little bit of cleverness, but... mostly patience.

222,"Text1: I got an earful from Granny Pinako and many death glares and silent treatments from Winry. It was back when we were dating. The reason I left Al in the first place? She had convinced me that I didn""t need anyone. She convinced me that life wasn""t my fault. That shitty things happen to good people. She had convinced me that the laws of alchemy didn""t exist. And that I didn""t need to punish myself. I took a mouthful of noodles. I believed in her. She became my safety net. My oasis in a storm. I looked up at Al to see him munching on a piece of chicken. He looked so happy, so innocent. He wasn""t though. I corrupted him; for years I tortured his mind with thoughts of our dead mother. Talking about her, obsessing over her death. He wasn""t innocent. He""d never be. I tainted him. It wasn""t bad enough that I covered myself in her blood. I shed it on him as well. I sighed and sipped my soda. Even though I killed my brother""s childhood, I couldn""t let him go. And it tortures me that I even left him for as long as I did. I don""t blame Winry; she was trying to help me grow as a person. But I can""t let go of the past. It""s all I live for, trying to right the wrongs that can never be fixed; it""s my cruel, torturous, world that I dragged my brother into and I refuse to let anyone else inside. She got in for a time, and in that short space of happiness we had, I managed to wound my brother beyond all comprehensibility. He never spoke a word of the week that I had abandoned him. But I saw it. In his eyes.

Text2: Two young twin brothers trudged heavily down a desolate, white, snow covered back street. It was only minutes after a snowstorm, but the two couldn""t bear another moment locked inside their mansion staring at the workers putting up Christmas decorations and listening to their mother and father bicker about the guest list. They snuck out of the back servant""s entrance and made their way out to the back road, pushing the snow out of their way as they went. So they walked, their foots sinking deep into the snow with every step they took. They walked for several blocks until they were out of their privileged neighborhood and onto the normal streets. ""This is a commoners place."" Hikaru frowned as he took in his surroundings. They stood near a corner of a closed convince store with toys displayed in the window. The buildings appeared to be industrial where they built machinery but it wasn""t currently in use this time of year. ""How long do you figure till they realize we""re gone?"" Hikaru asked, his eyes locked on the white sky above them as they leaned against one of the buildings. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his twin brother shrug and sigh, the air in front of his face puffing as he spoke. ""I don""t know...hour""s maybe. Before we left I saw Mother quarreling with one of the decorators and Father was crossing off every name on the guest list that he could think of."" ""Of course.""

Shaundrelle looked annoyed for a moment, probably because she now had to explain the extremely dirty dress, but the expression did not even last a second. She frowned and raised her head a few inches from the ground, wondering if she really wanted to do this. Sure, she had always thought Domick attractive. He was incredibly kind and she loved being with him more than anything else, but still she was not sure... Apparently, she had no choice in the matter, for, seemingly of it""s own will, her head lifted a bit more until her lips gently brushed against his. She felt him stiffen, and pulled her face away from his, thinking she had made the wrong choice, but he just followed her movement and kissed her again, realizing there were perhaps a bit more feelings between them then he had admitted to himself. Shaundrelle was surprised by her own actions. Surely a man of his station couldn""t return her affections. He must just feel sorry for her. But she didn""t get the chance to stop it... A voice filled the place. ""Well, well, well, Domick."" Domick froze. Murtagh sounded far too amused for comfort. Note: I know, it""s been forever.

That she had known who he was and hadn""t told him until now. He couldn""t count the times he asked his parents if he could meet the girl he""d taken a bullet for. After the first few years of being told no, he stopped asking, and started making plans of his own. He never understood why they wouldn""t let him meet her. He guessed they were just worried, too, in their strange way. Everyone was worried about him. His parents were worried about him, Mr. Kaneshiro and his wife were worried about him, his therapist was worried about him, and even Suoh was worried about him! Why? Why did they all worry so much? He didn""t do anything they were afraid he would do in response to his near-death experience. Yes, he was wary of people and didn""t get close to them easily, but that wasn""t anything to cause this much concern. He didn""t want people to worry about him. There was nothing wrong.

He nearly gave up in looking for her when he finally saw a figure sitting alone almost twenty feet away from the part. White silk dress, white flower band in the head. Without thinking twice, he went there ignoring his name being called by Finnick who was probably looking for him. ""I paid your drink,"" he slumped next to her. She then smiled shyly at him, ""Katniss, Katniss Evedeen."" This time she was the one to offer her hand. ""Pleasure to meet and hear you sing, Ms. Everdeen,"" he lifted her hand and grazed a light kiss on her knuckles. She gave a light chuckle. ""I never saw you before, tourist?"" Peeta weighed his answered but before that he gave a mysterious smile, enough to make her think of what it meant and not why he was not answering. ""Yeah, a tourist,"" he finally answered and the lady took a sip on her cocktail and stared at the sea. ""How about you how long did you live here?"" ""All my life,"" she stand up and removed her flower band. Peeta stood up and realized the distance they have between, just couple of inches. Katniss gently run her fingers on the contour of his face. ""I have never seen such beautiful eyes before, as beautiful as the sea"" she pulled away and grabbed the hem of her silk dress pulling up.

In fact, he nearly changed his mind when he saw it. ""N-Not really. But if you guys want to ride, I""ll ride too,"" Shizuka said.

She is to me in barely four gigantic, gazelle-like steps, and her arms are around me, her face at my neck. I look up from her soft hair and see who the others are.

I heard some shouting and looked to see one of the girls that was walking with Akira and Yuko not too long ago running toward us and shouting. She stopped in front of us and started panting. ""Yuko...she""s going to do something to Akira...!"" She wheezed. I looked at Kyoya. ""They""re in...an old shed..."" She said in between her breaths. ""Okay, show us where they are."" -*Akira*- I did the first thing on my mind; raising my leg and kicking Yuko in the stomach. She stumbled back and looked at me in surprise, before her face darkened.

""Not really"" I say. We sit in silence until I silently grab a knife from behind me. I position the knife carefully before I literally and figuratively stab him in the back.

The forest near them had mostly suplar wood trees, they grew moderately high and had magnificent dark green leaves, and rough grey-brown bark.

He started pressing harder on his hook and more of Wendy""s blood rolled down her neck and she screamed in protest. Wendy was right. Peter was hiding up in a tree thinking about what Wendy had said. Thinking about going back with her and growing up. Though the idea of growing up had always annoyed him and infuriated him, the thought of being with Wendy almost balanced that out. And then, the scream rudely interrupted his thoughts. He jumped down from the tree and followed where the scream came from. Only one thing in Neverland could make a scream like that and he wanted to make sure Wendy was alright. That was when he saw Hook and his crew. Hook was holding a knife to Wendy""s throat and had said something to her. After he had spoken to her, she pointed into a direction. Hook put away his knife and forced Wendy to walk with him. As he pulled Wendy along with him, he noticed the fresh cut on her shoulder and that was when he knew he had to follow them. He didn""t want to make himself present but he wanted to make sure Wendy would live. He followed them, staying in the bushes, not making a sound and not making anything around him move as he walked. And then, Hook challenged him. Now Peter is hiding behind a tree while Hook threatens to kill Wendy with his own hook. ""I know you""re watching, Peter Pan!

Oh, the last time how clearly you see everything; as though a magnifying light had been turned on it. And you grieve because you hadn""t held it tighter when you had it everyday. Dana repeated those words aloud in a whisper, gently setting on her coffee table what had been her favorite book as a child. A Tree Grows In Brooklyn always seemed to reveal something new upon each reading, but this time, it felt especially poignant. She absently traced the well-worn cover with her smooth fingertips, remembering when her mother had given her this book on her twelfth birthday. Dana had loved its heroine, Francie, and had always felt a connection with the character as both of them experienced the trials and tribulations of growing up. But tonight, more than ever before, did Francie""s observation ring true. Yes, Dana had held on during her four-year roller coaster ride of being Fox Mulder""s partner.

He needed coffee desperately. The street was silent with hollow rumbles of passing cars and winds and orange streetlights. He crossed the road and got into a diner that was still open. Sitting down on the booth near the window, he idly cast his eyes on the hushed street. A sleepy waitress approached and took orders. He felt uneasy because he had no spare cash to pay decent tip. Priority number one; Stiles needed a place to stay. Somewhere. Anywhere. Local newspapers should have information. After a few hours of sleep he would wake up and look for shared rooms or apartments so that he could move this stuff and settle in for the next- HOLY SHIT. The waitress jumped. So did Stiles because he realised that he shouted that out loud, and, also because he remembered that his father sent the parcel to that apartment couple days ago. It should be there. Panic. Sheer, utter panic hit him. Why didn""t he mention it when Stiles was there? Did he return them? He could have, since no one likes to take boxes of parcels with unknown contents from unknown address. Or dumped them? Shit, he probably dumped them as soon as he got them because who would put some stranger""s parcels in their house? People get rid of boxes with uncertain contains.

But how do we get out of the building and down there without anyone noticing us?"" ""I think it""s time for a little more ass kicking,"" she answered with a smile. But underneath that beam was a lonely girl longing for the truth about her past she had once tried to hide. She took William in her arms and hugged him tight, and then she took a deep breath, and led the way toward the thick bulletproof door. As she paced toward the door, she realized that for the first time in days, her ears were clear, free of the bothersome buzzing. The silence felt so strange.

I closed my eyes and shifter so that my presence known. I heard Kyo come over to the side of the bed. ""Tohru, sweetheart, are you awake?"" I fluttered my eyelids open. Kyo placed his hand on the side of my cheek. ""How are you feeling, beautiful?"" He asked with a smile. I sat up slowly. ""I feel... Sore... Very, very sore."" I said. It wasn""t a complete and total lie, I did feel sore; I mean I just had two babies. ""I am so sorry for putting you through all this..."" He said sadly. ""Kyo, please don""t blame yourself. Everything is fine. I am fine, I am pretty sure the babies are fine. Please do not apologize. Everything is going to be perfect."" I said with a sweet smile. He returned my smile, but I could tell I didn""t have him totally convinced that it wasn""t his fault. There was still a small twinge of guilt behind his smile. I reached out and gave him a hug. I missed the feeling of having him in my arms. His wonderful smell filled the air around me. He pulled me tightly to him. He let out a sigh of relief. He let me go and I sat there with the stupid air-headed smile that he had fallen in love with. ""Tohru... I have something really important to ask you."" He said AN: Hey guys, it""s me.

Ciel didn""t understand how it was possible that he was pregnant, but he was done trying to rationalize. Ciel got to his feet and stretched his aching back. Satisfied by the popping noise; Ciel crawled back into bed and rested his hand on his stomach. Sebastian had said Ciel had about a week until delivery. Ciel groaned as another sharp pain hit. The pain continued. ""S-Sebastian."" The boy called out breathlessly. The black clad butler entered the only seconds later ""Young Master, are you okay?"" Sebastian asked in a concerned tone; lightly placing his hand on Ciel""s cheek. ""I... am in... pain..."" Ciel gasped. Sebastian placed his hands on the side of Ciel""s ballooning stomach to check for anything wrong. ""Everything seems fine but we should visit father just to make sure."" Sebastian said to the teen. Sebastian leaned down and kissed the boy softly on the lips; placing him in a sleeping trance. Sebastian summoned a portal to hell, and picked the sleeping pregnant teen up. Sebastian and Ciel entered hell, and Sebastian ran quickly to his father""s house. He entered the house on his own accord; drawing attention from all the servants in that area of the house.

Kyouya sized his glasses, shoving them roughly onto his face as he jumped somewhat unsteadily to his feet, whirling to face the new comer over the loveseat. It was the second to last person he wanted to see there. It was Haruhi. ""Kyouya-senpai?"" she said uncertainly. ""What the hell are you doing here?"" he demanded in a low, choked, voice. ""I- I forgot one of my books,"" she said taking a step back towards the door, away from his red-eyed fury. ""Do commoners not have to custom of knocking?"" he said with barely stiffed rage suffusing his tear-filled voice. ""I didn""t think anybody would be in here,"" she said quickly. Haruhi looked down at her shoes while Kyouya hurriedly wiped his eyes. When she looked up there was something new on her face that the older boy could not identify. ""I don""t want him, you know,"" she said quietly her gazing flickering on and off his face. ""You don""t want who?"" he asked, trying to keep the snarl from his tone. ""Ta- Tamaki-senpai,"" she whispered. ""Any fool can see that,"" Kyouya spat. ""Well, any fool besides Tamaki. Why the hell are you telling me?"" ""Because,"" she began, but hesitated, clearly afraid of his reaction. ""Well?"" he snapped.

Sherlock asked the bartender. ""Him?"" he asked, jerking his head at the man swaying on the small stage. ""Yes."" ""He""s drunk."" ""Is that all?"" Sherlock inquired, scrutinizing his wasted flat mate who was singing very slurred karaoke to a song he was pretty sure was called ""Hot ""n"" Cold."" Sherlock had known of course that John was very, very drunk. Even a total moron could tell that. However, he was also sure there was something else wrong, something he could not quite put his finger on. He suspected it was some sort of social issue, which would explain why he was having trouble pin-pointing it. The bartender joined Sherlock in studying the drunken singer. ""I should know that you""re no good for meeeeee,"" John half-sang, half-shouted. ""He""s in love."" ""What?"" ""He""s in love,"" repeated the bartender, returning to washing glasses. ""He just broke up with his girlfriend."" ""Maybe he still likes her then."" ""But he broke up with her. Said there was a problem with their ""chemistry"" or something of that sort."" ""Then maybe there""s someone else,"" he said with a shrug. ""You going to order something?"" ""And end up like him? No thank you."" John finished his song and stumbled off the stage. Sherlock rose and went to collect him. ""Come on. You""re going home,"" he said firmly, taking John""s arm. ""Someone gunna pay for his drinks?"" called the bartender as they passed.

""Not unless you count the very advance Freecell and Solitaire games he bothered to download,"" Mulder answered sarcastically, picking up a seed and popping it in his mouth. Scully gave him a little half-smile, then, opening her briefcase, pulled out a large, fat manila folder full of (surprise!) paperwork. She pulled a pen out of her purse, sat down at Mulder""s desk, and began. About an hour later, the phone rang. Mulder, still engrossed in Freecell, made no motion to pick it up, so Scully, after capping her pen, did. ""Scully."" ""Agent Scully, I need you and Agent Mulder to report to my office in a half-hour,"" said a voice on the other end, presumably Skinner. ""Yes, sir,"" Scully replied and hung up. ""Mulder, Skinner wants to meet with us,"" she reported, turning to face him. ""Did he say why?"" Mulder asked, reluctantly shutting down the computer and polishing off the remaining coffee. ""No,"" Scully replied, organizing her files back into their respective cabinets. ""Let""s not go then,"" Mulder said, sitting back down in his office chair and propping his feet back on the desk. ""I only wish we had that opportunity,"" Scully said, then knocked his feet off the desk. The impact sent him spinning. ""Let""s go.""

""But would you let me at least get dressed first?"" ""Yes, just hurry."" he whispered. I grabbed some random pair of jeans and some random T-shirt and walked into the bathroom to change.

Distant in a way I have never experienced with her before. I am sure from the outside everything still appears fine, that Earth still revolves around the Sun like it always has. But for me, the whole universe has shifted. And it feels like I am falling, desperately reaching for the ground with my toes, kicking up empty air. I have tried to mend the situation. Have tried to be especially thoughtful, giving her space when needed, trying to put a smile on her face whenever the opportunity arises. But the more I reach for her, the further she retreats. And all I can do is watch her withdraw. She seems a million miles away, and is slowly but surely slipping through my fingers. Being an insomniac only makes things worse. Every morning I wake up unrested, having slept for the smaller and tossed and turned for the larger part of the night. In my dreams I find a million reasons for Scully""s behavior. She""s not interested in our work anymore. She""s fed up with me as her partner. She""s fed up with me as her friend.

Something about it... disturbed me. I returned to the living room and sat on the l-shaped couch. It was a few short moments until Kyoya-san returned to sit at my side.

Pendrell poured a glass for each of them and sat next to Scully on the couch, sipping at his glass. ""Quite the day today,"" he said. Scully nodded and took a sip.

The sun was bright, cheerful above them and he had to admit, though grudgingly, that it was indeed a nice weather, a fairly pleasant and much-needed diversion from continuous meetings and frowning faces he had to deal with since the break of dawn - or rather before the break of dawn six days ago. Reports of casualties seemed to be endless, messengers with strained faces traveled back and forth between them and the Wei""s ruler who by now had taken refuge in one of his nearest strongholds, and his generals had been sporting grave looks like tomorrow would never come. That was exactly why he had given Lu Xun a day off. The High Commander was not one to play favorites, but he did find the young strategist rather endearing in his eagerness to perform his duty as best as he could. And sometimes, things were just too much for a seventeen-years-old boy. He had seen it, the weariness painted so plainly on Lu Xun""s face, and the poor boy had even tried to cover it with a brusque manner Zhou Yu felt unnatural and unbefitting for one of his nature. A day off would do him good, he thought with a degree of satisfaction, but couldn""t help but to wonder if it was just another do-something-altruistic deed his friend had just mentioned. Perhaps. Not that it really mattered now. ""That guy was crazy,"" suddenly Sun Ce""s voice rose above their soft footsteps.

After that he could merely look up, wishing to reach for the blue firmament while he knew there would never be a meeting between the earth and the sky. Hopes of the fools. Not that he loved Yamazaki Susumu - the idea was purely laughable. Anything that had occurred between them was of what a master might take from owning a subordinate - an exceptionally loyal subordinate, that was. He also highly doubted that the younger man had any affection for him more than what his profession had demanded from him, but for some reasons this night, he was willing to destroy all he and Souji had slowly and carefully fostered for a pretty much non-existent love. For a moment, the fukuchou found some difficulties to determine which of the most sordid and nastiest among scorns and curses to be coalesced with his name. Promiscuity. Souji tolerated such behavior, but did not approve it. It was why he had such immense respect for Yamanami who held his love only for one woman. Souji would forgive him no doubt, would not change his behavior and their interaction since it was how the world moved - it was how they lived, how everything rolled to past - but the scar would remain, irremovable.

If this was the case, Mulder definitely wanted to share the cab with kind man. He knew that people on west coast were nicer than on the east. ""If you don""t mind. I""m in big hurry to get to the W.

Mulder rubbed his head and scowled at her, then suddenly bounded across the room, grabbing both her flashlight and the arm that held it and growling comically at her. She squeaked in surprise and briefly struggled with him, holding on to her coveted possession for dear life. ""Muldeeerrr,"" she cried, trying her darnedest to get it out as a warning, but ended up in laughter. ""Get your own flashlight."" ""I already have my own flashlight. Why would you need one?

The beam dimmed and she hugged it possessively against her chest. He huffed, flashed a grin at her and stalked off, pretending to be offended. ""Mulder?"" Scully called out quietly after him as he disappeared out the door. Her voice seemed to be a tad shaky. ""Where are you going?"" ""To find a flashlight.

""There""s got to be one in this mess somewhere,"" came his muffled complaint, as she heard him struggling around in the storeroom. A couple of minutes passed, and Scully became a little jittery as she watched the light in her hands dim even further. She licked and chewed at her lips. ""Mulder?"" she called out again.

I wanted a man in my life, but I knew it would never happen. Here, gays would have to become straights so they could have children for working the plants.

I made my way over to him. ""Marco..."" the word uttered off his tongue like it was the only word he knew. ""My love..."" I replied. He leaned in and we started to kiss. He kissed me and I kissed him. It felt...magical. Just then I heard an annoying buzzing sound in the back. I ignored it. As it started getting louder and louder, he started to leave. ""No don""t go..."" Finally the buzzing noise got to a point where he covered his ears and almost screamed. I shot up in my bed. ""A dream..."" I muttered. It was dream I had had before.

It felt like an eternity for the boy to come to the decision to turn around, and as soon as he does, he""s met with the face of a teary eyed Sylvia. She slowly places her hand on his cheek, brushing it along is jawline, he shudders at the contact, and places the groceries down. He gently pulls her close to him, wrapping his arms around her.

That moment, when their lips touched, Zephyr could feel something, something within his mind, like a pulling sensation, but not a pull apart but a pull together. After the pulling came the feeling of four things rejoining after years apart, the sensation of his fragments sent his entire body into over drive, already overwhelmed by the kiss, he nearly fainted, but willed himself to stay conscious.

The castle was far to the east of the province and considered the most technological advance due to the continuing research of Redstone and the great library. It was also a great port for the province for trade goods from across Minecraftia. Flamewolf wanted this hold for a foothold and to disrupt trade and income for Willconia. He assembled all other bandit and marauder groups and formed his own army to challenge the near castle of Icton. He and a band of thieves have raided Icton for its resources and then led a siege on it. First they took over the local mine and then moved up to claim the castle town. Emperor Will had gotten calls for aid but could not break through the lines of bandits, plus remnants from Dalton""s army. An official road had not been established so getting a force there was very difficult. Icton itself was holding out well with the creation of brand new siege machinery that was devastating. Auto turrets that shoot arrows and TNT catapults would bring many casualties to the invaders. But their resources were running out and the gate was beginning to weaken. So after one month the castle had fallen and all citizens either routed or died. Eventually Will had broken through the forest to Joey""s stronghold. The Willconian army then demolished the walls and invaded the castle town. The defending force would be overwhelmed easily due to the prolonged siege.

Text2: Erin is a seven teen year old girl who is mortal, unlike her parents who were both pure blood. No one knew why she turned out mortal, it was a mystery to everyone and she was most eager to find out. She lived like a vampire and all her friends were vampires. The only thing was she weren""t a vampire. Other than that, there was no difference. Erin was the only girl playing football with the guys, she loved it. She loved the wind passing her as she ran and the feeling of beating the boys at their own game. Plus, she didn""t like sitting besides she screaming fan girls of the football players. The two centres on the opposite side started. Max and Jet. Max was Erin""s older brother and had light brown hair with green eyes and Jet had jet black hair with the darkest brown eyes. They ran towards the goal Erin was defending. Max and Jet passed all the vampires, passing to each other. Erin quickly ran and intercepted the pass from Jet to Max. She kept running until the goal and scored. '""That was your fault Jet!'' Max joked '""Erin""s charms must be distracting right?'' '""Nah, the sun was in my eyes""' '""Funny when the sun was behind you ey-ey?'' Mick laughed, he was on Erin""s team and one of the older vampires playing. Max laughed '""Don""t ever touch my sister. Got it""' They all laughed and congratulated Erin. '""Now...it""s our centre again, lets go""' Jet said It was the same run through, them passing every player but when they got to Erin Jet vanished and when she next saw him, He scored. '""Whaa?'' Erin yelled '""No powers! Unfair!'' '""Oh Erin, if you""re so good...it shouldn""t be a problem""' Jet winked '""Alright, bring it!'' The","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""I see your pretty good with knives,"" Evelyn says, flipping her brown hair out of her face. ""I used to throw glass at home."" She nods and points to my scar, a white line that trails from my left eye to under my jaw. ""Is that how you got that?"" ""No,"" I say and offer no explanation. She doesn""t ask. Subconsciously, I touch my scar lightly and think about my father at home. He probably doesn""t know I even left, probably too drunk to notice. Paul would car, and I hold onto the memory of his smile telling myself that I need to come back home. Lee lets out a few more clicks and looks frustrated. ""What""s with the clicking, Lee?"" Evelyn asks. ""I""m using them to see you, as sort of a, sonar, I guess."" With a start, I realize he""s blind. Explains the milky blue eyes, I think to myself. I don""t waste my breath to ask him.

Text2: She reluctantly rolls out of bed and hastily collects her things -mostly clothes- from the floor, aware of Haymitch""s eyes on her. She shrugs them on and walks over to a basket of food she had brought during the night: crunchy, red apples, a loaf of fluffy baker""s bread and two brown hens"" eggs. She had acquired these items with great difficulty the day before; only people with money eat like that every day. While Haymitch dresses, she hastily slices the bread and apples and cooks the eggs on the old, single burner. They bring their meal outside and sit on the tiny porch""s steps, eating in silence, not wanting to ruin the satisfying tastes. Food, glorious, food, thinks Nemit. What it must be like to be rich and eat like royalty all the time! If she had money, she would definitely be fat. She supposes this is the one good thing about reaping day; the poor are permitted to indulge in such fine dishes. When they are almost done eating, Nemit""s recently acquired good mood vanishes when she spots two figures briskly walking in their direction. She nudges Haymitch and he looks up from his plate, fried egg dangling from his chin. ""Don""t worry, I""ll handle her.' He mutters, getting to his feet and wiping his face. She rolls her eyes. Haymitch says this every time they encounter his mother, but he always ends up at the woman""s mercy, giving in to her nasty remarks and threats. There has never been a time when he has actually stood up to her. The woman clumsily walks up the path to her home, clutching several packages in her left arm, and a young boy""s hand in the other. ""Morning, mother.' Haymitch greets the old bat casually. ""Hi, Haymitch,' she says distractedly.","{""output"": ""NO""}"

""I want to stay here ... just for a couple of days."" She can""t imagine a more isolated place than where they are. Mulder nods his head. So here they are, in a cabin on the edge of nowhere.

Did he really not understand what it meant to love someone? Had that man hurt him so badly in his childhood that he could not trust love at all? Why didn""t he understand?

More than anything though, he was sick of himself and his stupid, stupid feelings for Fujimori. There was a knock on the door of his room. ""Yeah,"" Sora called dully. ""You dressed, Hashiba?"" Nao asked through the door. ""Does it matter?"" Sora replied without energy or caring. ""It""s not like you haven""t seen me naked."" It was true.

He had wanted to know how Scully was doing, and he wanted to remind Mulder to make sure that Scully was at the commendation ceremony on Wednesday. Mulder had just leant back in his chair to think about how best to apologise to Scully when there was a knock on the door, and a male voice called his name. Mulder sat up, and invited the voice into the office. ""Agent Mulder, I""m David Akermanis. Agent Scully asked me to come talk with you about me joining your unit."" Mulder looked at Agent Akermanis. He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, about five feet ten inches and one-seventy pounds. Mulder almost hated him on sight, but swallowing his pride, he motioned to the visitor""s chair, and as Akermanis sat down, Mulder started talking. ""So, Agent Akermanis, tell me why you want to work with Spooky Mulder on the X-Files?"" Akermanis simply replied, ""Because it sounds interesting."" Mulder leant back in his chair and nodded. ""This kid might not be too bad,' he thought. The rest of Mulder""s day had flown by. He soon realised that Scully had essentially set up interviews for him to do the whole day, and he had spoken with five more agents, all of whom seemed genuinely interested in the X-Files. She had also sent him an email informing him of his interview schedule for Tuesday, and he had another five agents to talk with. More to the point, he realised that Scully had not come back to the office while he was there. He had taken a brief break for lunch, and when he got back, her things were gone.

They found themselves in a wide clearing of the park, and no digimon was to be found. At the opposite side of the clearing, however, was a girl who stood with her back to them. She seemed to be no older than Henry, Rika, and Takato, yet there was a solemnity about her that usually only came with age. While Katrina""s hair fell below her shoulders, this girl""s hair fell to the small of her black and was the color of the night sky without any lights. She wore a fluent white dress that fell just above her knees and was no sleeved. Without a word, the girl began to walk out of the clearing. ""Hey, wait a minute!"" Henry called to her. The girl continued to walk but looked at the them over her own shoulder. They were frozen stiff by the expression in her eyes. Her midnight blue eyes were lifeless and unremorseful, distant, and yet at the same time deep inside there seemed to be something burning like fire, an anger that was not brought to the surface of her demeanor. Before any of them could utter another word the girl had disappeared into the darkness of the night. ""Well that was a complete waste of time."" Rika said crossly. ""But still...""

Kuramochi is startled, almost, in how he can nearly exactly perceive the heat lingering from the ticklish skin of his jaw and then down, down, down, until the sensations are but flecks of ember along his extremities. Briefly, the idea of the warmth not being a part of his dream - vaguely aware that he""s still asleep, caught in an odd limbo of wakefulness and dormancy - but the thought flickers just as quickly out of his mind as it had appeared. Sparks of molten sweetness collect from the center of his chest and bolts its way to his lower belly, mind muddled by the increasingly pressing feelings of hot feels good kazuya don""t stop. Wetness envelops what he faintly senses as something of his that is throbbing, acute to the tide of relief that washes over him when the searing heat turns slick and pleasantly so. Increasingly growing conscious, Kuramochi reaches the beginning stages of cognizance, slow to recognizing that the familiar wetness he feels is a mouth, most likely from the tongue swiping at his skin, busying itself on his erection. He""s confused at the moment when his last thought properly processes through his mind again - erect? him? wasn""t he still asleep? - until he feels something very sharp grab at his skin, blunt like fingernails scrabbling for purchase against the flesh of his hips.

Chewing on his lower lip rather harshly, he shook his head against the sodden pillows beneath them as Hikaru knowingly brushed a bundle of nerves he had been looking for. ""Hikaru..."" Kaoru""s tone was firm, despite his lust, and the former gave a soft chuckle and pecked his lips longingly before fastening lithe legs around his waist securely. Purposely taking his time to pull out his fingers, he gave a sly look at his twin""s half-hearted glare, before guiding himself and thrusting into the surprisingly slick warmth of his brother. Tossing his head back in an even more erotic fashion, Kaoru cursed idly before the two began to move. Starting at a slow, teasing pace, he found his body was unwilling to let himself drag the process out any longer and they promptly increased their tempo.

The cool breezes that shifted the clouds and shook the leaves on the trees churned the air, keeping the temperature comfortable enough to be outside. Even without a watch, Nya could tell by the way the sun rested in the sky above her that it was only a few hours into the evening. Perhaps four thirty or five o""clock, but certainly not any later.

Yukine""s face contorted in pain and he screamed as his body fell on top of Yato""s. Hiyori skidded to a semi-halt as tears flooded her eyes and her legs trembled violently. She wasn""t fast enough? Did she just witness her friends die? The phantom turned in her direction, giving Hiyori the grounding she needed. Anger poured into her veins. Salt infiltrated her mouth and nose. Her chest burned. With a burst of new energy, Hiyori charged the phantom at full speed. Yato warned her on a regular basis not to go full power against phantoms because if her tail were to be severed then she would die, but at this point she was too clouded by loathing to think straight. She aimed her kick for the phantom""s only functioning eye, but the beast anticipated her movements and swiped at her with a claw. Hiyori twisted her legs into a split, but the claw managed to graze her thigh, leaving a mark that resembled a mild burn. She hissed as she alighted on her feet; her leg felt like it was on fire!

Kuramochi is startled, almost, in how he can nearly exactly perceive the heat lingering from the ticklish skin of his jaw and then down, down, down, until the sensations are but flecks of ember along his extremities. Briefly, the idea of the warmth not being a part of his dream - vaguely aware that he""s still asleep, caught in an odd limbo of wakefulness and dormancy - but the thought flickers just as quickly out of his mind as it had appeared.

The man with the cigarette nodded again, but this time the frightened man knew it was out of disapproval. The man who had switched the tapes adjusted some stuff so the focus was back on the trio on the couch. ""Do you want me to split them up?"" asked the frightened man, hoping he could make the smoking man happy. ""No, no. It""s too late, they""ll just find each other again."" Replied the smoking man, obviously not very happy that his plan to keep them apart had failed. The smoking man took one last look at the monitor before walking out the door. The three men looked at each other and back at the monitor. One man shut it off while the other two shut down the rest of the machinery in the room. Then they all left, nervously glancing at each other and their surroundings. They had pissed off the boss man. Back at the Mulder household, the movie had ended and Dana was getting ready to leave. Sarah walked back into her room to let her

Text2: Everyone in the town was still asleep, and she looked wildly for help. Everyone was safe in their houses, she thought bitterly. Except for one. A young man, aged 18, was ridding a tall and broad looking horse across the slowly awakening London. This young man was not just any an ordinary young man...No, far from it! His name, Mateo De Silva was well known around the city for being a good and honorable man. He was the much sought after son of Cristiano de Silva and Alyssa De Silva. Cristiano was a Spanish count that had immigrated to England after marrying Alyssa, a Beautiful British countess. Mateo wasn""t the only child of the De Silvas... Oh no, he had five sisters varying in age. The youngest was 6 and the oldest almost 17: Amber the oldest, Mercedes, 14, Annabel, 12, Camilla, 9 and finally Agata, 6. He thought a lot about his beautiful sisters as he rode through the quiet morning. Mateo was riding on his horse on the way to a friend""s house when all of a sudden his horse stopped abruptly. There, standing in front of him and his horse, was a girl. Unfortunately, he saw many street urchins such as her everyday; that was the unfortunate things about the poor in London. She was covered from head to toe in dust and ash. Her clothes, black shreds of cloth, barely covered her body. She was actually quite ugly apart from her piercing green eyes; they were the color of emeralds. Her eyes beautiful as they were, were full of water as if she was about to cry. After looking at the girl for a good two minutes, Mateo heard her say, in a raspy voice barely audible. ""Help me, they""re chasing me, please, protect me! And","{""output"": ""NO""}"
288,"Text1: ""Land subsidence?!"" The others tried to get closer looks as well and Ayako turned to Naru in shock. ""That""s it? The psychic phenomenon was caused by this?"" Naru explained. ""This whole development was built on top of damp ground. Based on the number of wells that I checked, directly underneath the school there is a big water vein running through. There are two other wells, but when I checked for the amount of water in them, they were both empty. So that""s what""s going on."" ""What is going on?"" Mai questioned confused and I pointed to the graph on the paper to explain. ""The school was built on wet soil and now that the water is evaporating, that soil is drying up and becoming more compact. The space where the water used to be is just air now, so the weight of the school is pressing down on that and slowly sinking. Because of that, the building is probably shifting and distorting."" Naru nodded. ""Exactly."" ""Then that""s what would have caused the chair to move and the ceiling to collapse."" Mai concluded. ""Precisely. The classroom floor on the West side is three inches lower than the one on the East side."" ""That""s a big gap."" ""And that rapping sound?"" Ayako questioned and I spoke up again. ""Probably wood creaking."" Naru sighed. ""The area around this building should be declared unsafe to enter. Sooner or later this building will collapse."" He got up and started to head into the building; Mai and us following. Myself, if only to help move his equipment and get my taiyaki. Kuroda showed up then though and upon Naru explaining his answer to her, she promptly flipped out about it. ""That""s fine, but it still doesn""t explain the day I was attack!"" ""Perhaps it was a

""I thought you""d like this, Alex~"" He whispered in my ear, catching Ciel""s attention as well. ""After all, who wouldn""t want to see two men like Sebastian and Agni fighting it out, hm?"" Ciel raised a brow as I felt my ears heat up, swallowing thickly. ""What are you going on about?"" ""Nothing~"" Lau smiled innocently as the fight began. ""Now then, please kindly go easy on me."" Sebastian smirked as Agni charged. ""Here I go!"" It was the best thing I had ever experienced, watching those two fencing. It almost appeared as though they were dancing with the way they professionally dodged jabs and used their impeccable footwork to move around the room. Ducking, sliding, jumping, twisting, thrusting. I barely managed to keep my mouth from dropping open in shock and admiration as I struggled to keep my mind on massaging Ciel""s arm. At a point though, Sebastian and Agni had both their blades touch tip to tip and they bent so far that the two weapons broke in half. ""Oh, my."" Sebastian said as he caught the end of his sword that broke. ""The sword""s broken."" He didn""t seem too disappointed though and, if anything, he looked relieved that it was over. Probably because he can get back on schedule now. I mused, though still trying to get over the scene I""d just watched. Grell would""ve died watching that. Lau was left in charge to keep them from going at it again. ""This means that it""ll be impossible to compete anymore, so this match ends as a draw.""

When he was undercover as a married man before he discovered the x files, when he was dating Diana, he hadn""t told Scully about her, maybe he never would, most likely she""d find out anyway though. Now he had the normal life he was in constant ecstasy, life had never been sweeter, he was engaged to a beautiful, intelligent caring woman, who was his best friend and soul mate and she was pregnant! A baby of their own, Mulder smiled to himself widely at the thought. He felt Scully stir beneath him and tensed himself normally it was morning sickness that woke her up, sure enough she ran to bathroom and he chased after her ready to hold back her hair, last night they spoke to Bill and Tara, their meeting with Maggie hadn""t gone well, she didn""t believe Mattie was conceived via IVF, she thought Mulder and Scully had talked them into telling her that, after some more arguing Maggie asked them to leave. They had also received a call from his Mom she would be landing at JFK airport at 2:00pm, Bill and Tara were also going back to San Diego soon so it worked out well. After Scully finished throwing up Mulder went into the kitchen to make breakfast, Scully""s appetite had increased dramatically so muesli just didn""t cut it anymore.

I said vehemently. It couldn""t be too late already. ""She isn""t? That""s amazing!"" He looked very surprised. Although, Virgil seemed like the type to be surprised that his own head was screwed on. However, he suddenly frowned. ""Wait a moment. That is amazing."" Brow knitted, Virgil appeared to be mentally working out something which bothered him quite a bit, as he began pacing again while chewing on his thumbnail. But before I could ask him what was wrong, he broke out into a grin again. ""Someone""s reaching out of their jurisdiction!"" he said in a sing-song voice. It sounded oddly sinister coming from him.

K-Kristoff?"" she whispered in terror. ""If only-"" the man""s bulky frame shrank, his toned muscles thinned and became more lanky. His facial features also changed- he went paler as his face became gaunt, hauntingly creepy. His boyish grin twisted into a sneer that made her stomach drop. He pulled away from their sweet embrace, a smaller pair of hands grabbed her roughly by the tops of her arms. ""-there was someone out there-"" his beautiful, golden-blond hair shortened and turned a fiery, hellish red. And instead of staring into Kristoff""s amazing brown eyes, she was pinned down by forest green eyes filled with a burning hatred and jealousy. ""No..."" ""-who loved you..."" Darkness.

Things had been such a whirlwind lately that sleep had been evading her. ""At least I was able to get through the night this time,"" she muttered, stretching her arms over her head, then dropping them. She felt something clutched in her hand. Looking down, she smiled softly at the knit cap. Kristoff""s cap. Since the day of Hans"" capture and banishment, the ice harvester had been given an open invitation to stay at the castle.

Text2: To begin with, that day scenery was ancient Egypt and the Pharaohs. Tamaki had spent the entire meeting time begging Haruhi to wear a Cleopatra costume. The room was sweltering; since they were supposed to be in the desert, Tamaki had decided to raise the heat in the room to 95 degrees in order to make is seem more...authentic. Not to mention that sand blanketed the entire floor. Then, thanks to a misplaced bun-bun, Haruhi tripped, spilling two pitchers of iced tea and earning herself another 20 clients added to her debt, as well as clean up duty. Therefore, Hunny and Mori had left as soon as the club had ended. They had to attend one of Mori""s kendo matches. Kyoya was at his desk, hunched over his computer as his fingers flew over the keys; he was obviously scheming up a new plot to get money for the club. Tamaki was off somewhere doing something that Haruhi was not sure she wanted to know about. Hikaru and Kaoru were finishing up with their last clients. Haruhi had just finished packing up the last of the costumes and putting them in the storage room. Her hand was mere inches away from her bag and her thoughts were drifting towards the sale at the supermarket she was stopping at on the way home. ""I need eggs, cheese, sugar...I think they have crab on sale-' ""Ha-ru-hi."" ""Come here please."" Haruhi groaned internally and trudged over to the ginger-haired jokesters with her arms crossed and her shoulders back. ""Yes?"" she huffed. When she was close enough, Hikaru""s hand shot out and grabbed her wrist, pulling her down to sit on the plush, red couch between him and his brother.

I didn""t have long to worry though, before long Jordan had me in his arms and was moving me out of my room. I didn""t know how many rooms these trains had, but he kept on taking me towards the front of the train, through cars I""d never been in before. When he pulled me into a room, there were already a few injured folks lying out on beds. The obvious doctor on duty looked at us, and pointed to one of the few vacant beds. Once Jordan laid me down, he pulled up a chair, and took a hold of my hand. This was something that I knew couldn""t get back to Snow, and I was praying that it wouldn""t. It took a while before someone came over to inspect my head. When the man did, he did so with a frown. ""She""ll need that stitched up. We can do a better job once we""re at the Capitol, there won""t even be a scar then. But for now, keep applying the pressure to it. She""s not serious as some of these burns are."" The cooks had been in the kitchen car preparing dinner when the train lurched to a stop. There were a lot of burns amongst them. Clean bandages were pressed into the top of my head, and that was when I felt dizzy, almost clammy, and my stomach churned. I knew that I""d be sick if I moved around at all.

Hikaru sat down on Haruhi""s right; Kaoru, on her left. Both of them leaned forward and took an end of a pocky stick, biting gently on the end. Being careful not to break the stick, they began eating their way towards their favorite toy. Haruhi remained impassive and, seemingly unknowingly, began chewing her way towards the twins, pulling the ends of the pocky sticks into her mouth. She stared forward, somehow succeeding in keeping herself from blinking. Hikaru blushed as he noticed Haruhi working her way towards him. He wondered silently what was up with her; she was usually not one to participate in these types of things unless forced to do so. He grit his teeth, almost breaking the pocky in the process.

He looked down, watching the water brush quickly against his shoe, and then took another step.

They dodged to and fro, weaving within one another to create a light show that simply captivated me. With a glance downwards, I could see that the lights came to a head in front of me, slowly narrowing until I would reach the end.

And forever after that it is surprise after surprise, as he is assailed time and again at the most inconvenient moments with the urge to do it again. Trumped only by constant unflagging surprise each time he finds it somewhere inside of himself to resist. The odd irony is that they have never shared a kiss. Oh, he remembers distinctly how their mouths fit together, so neatly, so rightly, that it seems all the more a shame they never tried again. But it was never this mouth - neither hers nor his.

CHAPTER 4 I find Alabaster, our District""s Capitol Representative, extremely annoying. He is probably in his thirties, but acts younger than me. I wondered how he manages to not trip over his overly long, blue wig. I was so curious that I decide to step on it on the train, just to see what happens. ""OW!"" He cries when I trap his aqua tips with the edge of my boot. Wow, his hair is actually real. How is this possible? My sister Mino""s hair only reaches mid back. She spend all of her fourteen year old childhood herding sheep and chasing off coyotes, but here is this one capitol guy who is excessive enough to only need to worry about growing his hair. ""Sorry,"" I apologize half heartedly, and walk away. I see the Capitol Trainer""s sly smile, his sharp cheekbones cutting into the air. Him, I might actually tolerate. There is tons of delicious food on the train. I won""t lie; I ate as much as possible. It was so good I couldn""t resist. I also remembered to drink a lot of water too.

I hadn""t meant anything by that remark but he winced anyway. As usual, I ignored it. ""Let me run you a bath while you get out of your clothes; your muscles will appreciate it,"" he offered as he began to kneed at the muscles around my neck. I smiled at how good my impromptu massage felt and closed my eyes contentedly, ""You""re good to me Mulder."" I think I actually purred that sentence. I took a breath and tried to speak normally, ""How was your day yesterday? Did you made the world a little bit safer?"" He paused for a second before he dropped his hands to my waist. He gave me another chaste kiss before he headed to the bathroom. Over the sudden rush of running water I heard him call out, ""I had a meeting with Skinner yesterday, trying to get his approval."" I hung up my coat and tucked my hand bag away before calling out, ""Approval? For what?"" I rolled down my stockings as Mulder emerged into the lounge room again. He leaned against the wall and watched me for a moment before he spoke. ""For an X-File."" I simply looked at him with stockings in hand and said nothing. It had been so long since that life and I thought it was something behind us, in our past. I thought we had moved on to another part of our lives. ""Scully?"" he looked at me questioningly. ""I""m just surprised Mulder. It""s been so long since that word has crossed your lips,"" I replied. He shrugged at me as if to say it wasn""t his fault, and that

The FBI had been called in for an unfortunately routine disgruntled-post-office-employees call. Things had been going to hell lately. ""Well, at least I get to spend some quality time with you,"" Mulder responded, nonchalantly putting his arm around her waist. ""Whoa, loverboy,"" she whispered, edging away from him. ""It""s all about protocol."" ""Screw protocol,"" he said, stretching his arm out behind her and letting it drop to his waist. He watched the agents gathering around the large wooden doors of the building, as they crouched behind a police car. ""Scully, I""m tired of crouching,"" he muttered, lifting himself up and stretching his limbs. She observed him from the ground, watching his white t-shirt lift up just enough to see his tanned side. ""Mulder...get down here."" He sighed, looking around. ""There""s nothing going on here, baby."" ""Scully."" ""Yeah. Scullllyyy."" He looked down as she rolled her eyes, which made him smile. ""I mean it, Mulder."" He loved it when she got pouty. ""Mmhmm, I know you mean it, Sculllyyy."" Suddenly, there was a shout and gunfire. Mulder was down as quickly as he had sprung up. Scully""s senses perked to a new level-the level that she had so quickly learned in her first encounter with a shooting and that hadn""t ebbed over time. She could feel the first twinge of adrenaline as it shot through her veins, laced with a small dose of fear. Mulder lifted himself so that his eyes were over the hood of the car as he heard more gunfire. ""Oh my god, Scully."" She lifted her head, peeking over with him. Her gun was in her hand and ready. She saw three agents on the ground, bleeding profusely. ""I have to","{""output"": ""NO""}"

She smiled and tenderly touched his face, ""A basic flip and when I had him on the ground, I crouched down with my knee in a strategic location. I told him nothing was going to happen and if he continued this campaign in any way, I""d bury him."" John nodded in approval, ""Good you let him know you were threatening to go to management."" ""No, I assured him I meant I""d literally bury him because I""d learned a lot on the X-Files and as far as I was concerned it didn""t matter to me if he was buried dead or alive.""

She trailed her fingers over his face and left them on his lips to let him know her answer. ""To finish about Wilson, I grabbed my bags and left. He remained on the ground showering me with invectives."" ""Like what?"" ""Frigid bitch, cock tease, etc."" John""s mouth tightened despite her gentle touch. ""He better never show his face here. Wilson sent one more email which probably came after that. I didn""t want to see it."" ""It""s over for now or at least that part of it is."" Monica smiled at him and turned toward their desks.

Less than a second and her eyelids closed. No one could ever tell that she wasn""t able to take all her requests! ""Okay... you can open them now!"" Once again, she granted her wish, in expectation. She couldn""t help but to giggle when she noticed the necklace made with noodles, still shining due to the inks she had used to paint them. Behind her ""surprise"", the little one bestowed her with a tender and childish smile. ""It""s beautiful, Emily!"", Dana said, while feeling a new and warm sensation sprouting on her chest. ""You made it?"" Emily nodded with her blonde head. ""Yes. Aunt Tara gave me the idea. She did the same with her kids from kindergarten!"" ""Ah, now I see why Aunt Tara finished the noodle stock at her home..."" ""It""s for you! It""s for you to use on today""s dinner!"" Dana focused her attention at the necklace that the little girl - her daughter - was offering her. No doubt it wouldn""t be her first choice for such a moment, for any moment, to be true. However, once she couldn""t destroy her joy, she removed her red hair from her neck and tied up the loose points around it. The showy red, blue and green from the inks weren""t a match to her chosen sweater cream tones. Funny... it doesn""t look that bad!

When you are grabbed by a ghost, you cannot just dematerialize. His cronies flung me onto his bed, holding me down with grips like iron. ""Nombre de dios, Paul. What did I do? Let me go, now!""

Lorelai is assaulted with memories when she sees that the female is just a girl, with a young angular face and large gray eyes that are filled with tears.

One is splashed across the right part of her forehead before disappearing into her hairline, another is at a direct diagonal to the first on the left of her chin, directly beneath the third, a black eye.

The Kingdom of Wei had no small army and the latest report their spy had just conveyed with the utmost grimness had confirmed that. No less than a million of man force had built a gigantic camp at the north side of the Yellow River. True that the massive army had not made any movement since they had arrived yesterday night, but that did not mean they would only sit idly either. Knowing Sima Yi, there must be secret plans to follow, Lu Meng thought pensively. Their High Commander, General Zhou Yu, had been sporting a grim face throughout the day, which had never been a good sign among his officers. But he was skeptical that the commander""s mood would improve if he arrived and discovered the condition here at the meeting room. Or rather the atmosphere among his generals. Strategy meetings, Lu Meng reflected sadly, should be much more sincere and less hostile. Clack. That sound again. Lu Meng looked up from the fold of his hands just in time to catch Lu Xun throwing a glare to Ling Tong who in return regarded him with lazy, not-so-innocent eyes. They were engaged into a staring battle for a while before the younger of the two snorted and went back to his scroll. Lu Meng released the breath he didn""t realize he had been holding and glanced at the other generals in the room, Huang Gai and Zhou Tai, who seemed to share his sentiment toward the predicament and were sporting an equally grim look on their faces.

His consolation, but also his own personal hell.

I smile because that is Katniss""s sister""s cat who survived the rebellion, but sadly Prim didn""t. I wish I would have gotten to see Prim. I shake the thought away and go upstairs. I knock on Kairi""s door and hear her voice ""Come in."" I walk in and see her smile. I give a faint smile and she knows something is wrong. ""What""s wrong?"" She askes. I give a sigh and quietly say ""I""m going back into the Arena."" She nearly faints and starts to cry at the same time. I get over to her before she falls off the bed. I slowly get her to calm down, but it takes ten minutes to do it. I look at her with soft eyes ""Kairi I""m going to be fine ok? Your parents are my mentors, they""ve been through two games. They brought me back once and they can do it again."" She gives a me a small nod and a kiss on the cheek. ""I know it""s a little late in the afternoon, but do you want to go get something to eat?"" I ask with a reassuring smile. She smiles and gets out of the bed. I go downstairs and start to make us some noodles and bake a little bread, but not as good as Peeta""s bread, which is amazing. She finally comes downstairs wearing a forest green tanktop and some light blue skinny jeans. She walks over to the table and sits down. ""Why do you take so long?"" I ask with a laugh. She frowns at first, by she slowly

""I promise,"" he says, kissing my head again, then we walk to our destination. I slide my right arm around his waist under his coat.

The middle child is their daughter, Abbey, who""s fifteen years of age, and then there""s Alex, the birthday boy.

They had swallowed the excuse about Haruhi being the twins"" long-lost cousin and the real Haruhi having to volunteer at the soup kitchen with surprisingly few questions. (Kyouya insisted that the last part of the fabrication was conductive to the growth of the natural type""s fan base, much to Haruhi""s chagrin.) Of course, this meant that she had spent the duration of the night answering to the ridiculous name of ""Hanami"", as well as being led around on the host club king""s arm like a crown jewel. The most painful part of the experience was pretending to giggle when clusters of jealous female partygoers interrogated her about the mysterious overnight courtship (""So, have you kissed yet?"" ""When did you start dating?"" ""Tell me, does he really prefer briefs over boxers?""). Her date, however, was annoyingly ebullient about the whole thing, which wasn""t helpful in the least. It was almost a relief when the crowd died down and left her with only one nattering grievance, although the rest of the host club had dashed off to parts unknown with a suspicious amount of gusto and an unnecessary amount of snickering. But, Haruhi had signed herself up for this one, and she would stick it out, no matter how unbearable. (Puppy dog face, be damned.) ""It""s such a nice night, isn""t it?"" Tamaki chattered, in the overly casual way that he sometimes did to avoid saying what was truly on his mind. ""I think the host club social went very well. Kyouya should be happy.

Of course, in her lifetime, she had not come into acquaintance with many men outside of uniform, but somehow it made things seem slightly more okay when the arrest of her good sense was by him. Perhaps because he was still unmistakably a smuggler, and he was only doing what he did best. She knew that she was filling the shoes of That Girl quite well, at the moment, and that she might be only a conquest and everything thus far might only have been temporary fixation. However, she wasn""t worrying about repercussions, because she was certain the look of questioning he gave her every so often meant that he cared at the moment, at least. He wasn""t good at conveying these things, and she was temporarily grateful - she did not want to worry about the weight of them. There were at least a hundred reasons why this was A Very Bad Idea. But, in light of the circumstances, and on account of the girl being the Princess, who was Letting Him Touch Her, they were pushed out of mind temporarily. It was beginning to become one of those Heat of the Moment scenarios, and he wasn""t sure that he wanted it to be like this. Once again, on account of the girl being the Princess, who was tiny and sword-tongued and plucky and The Most Infuriating Woman He Had Ever Met, famous for Never Letting Anyone Touch Her, except on those occasions when touching was unavoidable and just recently. Maybe he should stop and Think About What Exactly He Was Doing before Something Very Bad happened. But the look in her eye kept stopping him.

No suck luck, just Evans and her two friends. The blonde and red head locked eyes, lather sneering as she marched up to her dorm. Adrian rolled her eyes but gave a faint smile to the other two. She had nothing against the quiet and mousey Alice Prewett or the dark skinned, black haired Hindi, Amita Kala. They were nice enough. No one""s gonna hurt you, No one""s gonna dare.

""We got here nearly an hour early, and then we had to keep driving in circles around the terminal because the police officers wouldn""t let us stay."" Armin wasn""t entirely sure how to reply, partly because he was blown away by Eren""s enthusiasm, partly because he was still trying to parse through that flood of German. Armin was not bad at the language, not by any means. His prowess at the language was what landed him the chance to come on this exchange program. That didn""t mean that he was used to hearing it spoken so conversationally, so fast. ""Sorry I took so long,"" he ventured. Eren gave him an incredulous look. ""Why would that be your fault? You weren""t driving the plane,"" he said. They arrived at his parents. ""It""s nice to meet you,"" Carla said. She forwent a handshake, leaning down to hug him gently. She was tall and willowy. Her face was tired and her hair was tossed to the side in an unassuming ponytail, and she was entirely gorgeous. Next to her, Grisha seemed stiff and plain.

The Capitol and the 12 districts reside within the nation of Panem. There were once 13 districts, but the districts rebelled, and as a result District 13, responsible for graphite mining, was utterly destroyed, and The Capitol began the annual Hunger Games. They take a boy and a girl from each district, ages 12-18, and have them fight to the death in an arena of The Capitol""s creation. They pick these ""Tributes"" by placing all the children""s names in a bowl on slips of paper, and drawing. If you are poor and starving, you may receive a tessera, which is a supposedly years-worth supply of grain and oil. You may take one tessera for each of your family members, but there is a catch. For each tessera, your name is entered into the ball more times. At the age of 17, my name is in there 38 times, for my family is not of the lucky intelligent inventors of District 3, rather we are the poor factory workers, and neither of my sisters are old enough to work, and my father is old and tired, and is unable to work the long hours necessary to support us. As a result, I take all the tessera I can, and work something like 84 hours a week. This is the day of my 5th reaping ceremony, and my little sister Cassia""s 1st.

I was afraid of the answer. I hated this feeling of lowliness and I knew that one way to feel better was to actually ask him about his feelings towards me. I needed to know how he felt. I felt very cut-off yesterday, having admitted my feelings towards him and receiving no response. Somehow it struck me as a negative thing, that maybe he didn""t feel the same. I sighed with frustration inwardly. I was pathetic. I was terrified of what he would say, of what he might say. As much as there was a chance of his denial, there was an equal chance of his acceptance. I was focusing too much on the negative, but it was hard to find the positive and hold onto when the negatives were as heavy as they were now. Or maybe I was simply too transfixed on them. In the end, it wasn""t really the most important thing that was happening. Frustrated with this silence, with this feeling of limbo, I turned to my fiancé.

It was after four hours of talking about their ambitions and hopes until they realised it was 2:00 in the morning. They went to bed, made out, then without thinking about it fell asleep. Scully woke up close up to Mulder""s face. He breathed on her nose and it tickled. She slowly slid her arms out and moved out from under the sheet, trying be as quiet as possible. She turned on her coffee machine and opened her pantry to pull out a box of muesli. All the bowls were dirty, so she went to the top cupboard to pull one out. Because it was too far back she had to take a chair and stand on it to be able to reach the bowl. When she obtained it, she lost her balance and tried to grab the cupboard door, but she fell back and hit her head on the counter. Mulder had woken up before he heard the loud crash coming from the kitchen. Straight after the noise he pulled his sheets off and jumped out of the bed.

She somehow brought that out of him and only because she made him turn into a silly teenager when she got dressed up like that. Man, it was awful. He was a grown man.

He""s not sure the same can still be said. The soldier stands up to his full height and he is once again struck by how tiny Madge is in comparison to his own muscular, 6 foot, 3 inch frame . Posy follows him, jumping off the table and looking up at him expectantly. The lollipop is still in her mouth and her lips are turning purple; he can""t help but laugh at her, and she giggles too. He grabs her sticky hand and looks back at Madge, who is staring at their clasped hands with an uncharacteristically wistful look on her face that she immediately shakes off as soon as she sees that he""s looking. She bends down until she is on Posy""s level. ""It was nice to meet you, Posy,"" she says, her smile full and pretty. Posy practically melts; he can tell that she idolizes the blonde already. She gives her a toothy purple grin and a hug. Madge stands back up and smoothes her worn gray dress, looking back up at Gale. ""Hawthorne,"" she says, nodding at him before turning and walking to the door. He calls her back without thinking, ""Undersee?"" She turns slightly, raising an eyebrow at him. He smirks.

""You wanted me down here ASAP; what""s up?"" He looked up, about to launch into an explanation, but paused. ""Scully, haven""t you ever heard the phrase ""rise and shine""? Smile!"" He proceeded to give me an exaggerated demonstration of how the word was performed, and I felt my lips curving upward in a grin of their own. It wasn""t the joke or his goofy grin that made me smile, though. It was the laughter behind his eyes that almost no one else ever gets to see. Then he sobered and went back to his ""case.""

I couldn""t care less about the selfish Capitol people, it""s her I care about. As if my body were moving on its own, I reach out and take her face into my hands. My head is going to explode as millions of thoughts run rampant in it. There are about a million things I want to do with that lovely, lovely face. I choose an option that won""t possibly make me spontaneously combust out of embarrassment and slowly touch her forehead to mine. Damnit. I made the wrong choice. My face is burning up even more than before, and I""m pretty sure that I""m scaring her. But I don""t want to let her go. I don""t want to leave her without clearing up what I""m doing. So I whisper a feeble thank you to her and kiss her on the nose. I hoped that she would be satisfied by this and it would explain my actions. But, instead, she seems unsatisfied and as I pull my face away from hers, she suddenly grabs me and pulls me even closer.

Whether that final change would be one for the positive was something she was just going to have to find out. The party that had started the whole affair had been made a mandatory thing by Kouya and thus, aware that she could be better spending her time elsewhere; she""d spent the first hour in the worst of moods. Honey had eventually worked her out of this ""frump"" with a cute little pout and the childish enquiry of, ""Aren""t you going to miss me, Haru-chan?""

Tohru ate happily, loving the taste and smell that filled the home. ""So what took you so long?"" Kyo asked her, meeting her gaze. ""I passed this cafe on the way home. It looks nice enough, and they are looking for an assistant, to do multiple jobs. I wondered if I should apply there, so I went inside to look around, and I liked it."" Tohru explained; a flush of excitement evident on her face. Kyo smiled warmly at her. ""It sounds perfect.""

Besides, it was only a small amount of dishes to be washed, since the cutlery could be cleaned using the dishwasher. The rest of the afternoon was quiet for Tohru. Kyo had gone

He said, his cheeks flushed with excitement and hope. ""And a fine knight you would be."" The Baron told him and was rewarded with an even larger smile from the small boy. Horace practically glowed with the praise, momentarily forgetting his loss and his situation. ""Would you like to see the other Ward children now?"" The Baron asked, realising they needed to get back on topic. The boy nodded, his smile still present, although it wavered at the prospect of meeting new children. Arald stood and came around, helping the boy down from the large chair with an offered hand. Hesitantly, Horace took it, smiling when he was safe back onto his own feet. The Baron went ahead without warning, and Horace found he wanted to keep up with him. Eventually, he found a pace that kept him slightly behind the Baron. ""Sir?"" ""Hmm?"" Arald answered, glancing back and down at the boy. ""Just you see, I""ll be the best knight in Redmont."" Horace promised, his eyes bright with determination.

First it was like before, sweat and slow but then he gradually started to build it up trailing his tongue along my bottom lip asking for the access I didn""t hesitate in giving. It grew deeper and quicker as I opened my mouth and soon it became wet and hunger graved as my emotions flared. My hands rushed up his strong bare back into his hair and I gasped into his open mouth, whilst our tongues were entwined and his hands trailed down my sides, his fingers skimming over the curves of my breasts and coming to rest flat on my stomach. I felt my body arch against him as his hands travelled slowly back up again, leaving a tingling path in their wake as they finally reached the destination. His hands were warm and gentle and he knew exactly how to tease every emotion out of me with every touch. ""Jesse-"" I whispered, but he shut me up by kissing me deeper, something I couldn""t have deemed possible, but he managed it. I could feel every ounce of me, every part of my body giving into him.

It felt like there was something shoved down his throat and someone was holding it to make sure it stayed there. Tears started to gush out of his small eyes as he cried for someone to come. He kept looking around to see if there was anyone coming, but everything was getting blurry, everything was slowly going black until he saw a man rush in with a nurse.

I""m in a wedding in two weeks, you see so between that, school and my job my time gets eaten fairly quick. Just a side note, based on the events of last chapter: I like the ninja of Konoha. I really do, don""t be deceived by the fact that I""m writing about Otagakure. Really I couldn""t see them leaving Hinata where she was for any other reason than believing she was already dead. That doesn""t mean that they don""t care about her in this story. As to what she thinks of them...well, you know what I""m going to tell you... Coercion Arc I: Swaying the Branch Does the walker choose the path or does the path choose the walker? Darkness Hinata walked around in a fog. Kabuto somehow knew she would be out of it, so he had her in less important jobs such as stocking medical supplies. She was rolling up bandages and contemplating what Sasuke had told her. How...how could they do this to her? Her father was a prominent man in the village. He must have known she wasn""t dead. Why didn""t he cause such a big deal like he did about the last Hyuuga

Text2: ""Takashi, you""re sick, you shouldn""t go anywhere in this cold,"" she told him bluntly. Mori wasn""t to be beaten. ""Then let""s order in. What do you want?"" he asked getting up to get his take out menus. ""Takashi! You don""t have to do all that!"" Haruhi said quickly. Mori was already dialing a number. ""I feel like Thai today, how about you?"" he said. Haruhi sighed and crossed her arms in slight annoyance. ""I""ll have what ever you have,"" she relented. Haruhi used the time while Mori was preoccupied with ordering to look around the apartment. She saw a group of pictures on a low table and she walked over to inspect them. There were pictures of his brother, Hunny, one of the entire Host Club together. What really caught her eye was a picture of his kendo class. All the children crowded around Mori smiling brightly, save Leon of course. He sat next to Mori with a suppressed grin. Haruhi smiled and held the frame in her hands so that she study it better. When she placed it back on the table, she noticed the picture it was next to. It was one taken a few weeks ago during one of the many times when she and Mori went riding. She and Mori had just returned from a ride on the trail, and they were both smiling about something, she couldn""t remember. Next thing they knew, a stable hand had snapped a picture. She was amazed at how well it turned out and a little surprised that Mori had bothered to frame it. ""That""s my favorite picture,"" he said leaning his chin on her shoulder. She was startled by his sudden closeness. He laughed a little at her expense. ""Did I scare you? I""m sorry,"" he said. Mori ran","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He said and I rolled my eyes playfully, since we""re just in a call, so he didn""t notice it. ""Of course you can. All of my friends, including you can."" I said and I can tell that he""s smiling. ""Okay then. See you there in a few hours!"" Adam said as he hung up. Huff (Did I really just type that? xD)... Adam""s coming over. I mean...

He abused me for being that and he kept on repeating on saying that being gay is a sick. Well, he passed out a few months ago so I""m safe. But, I knew that dad can escape through what happened. Yes. I hope he""s dead. My eyes widened as a voice came into my head. I shook my head a little and it disappeared. I sighed in relief and I rolled up my sleeves. Cuts.

My eyes softened and I need to wash it off quickly or else Adam will notice it. After washing it off, I saw the blade that I

Propped by one arm against the metal support beam of the rest stop sign, he stood at a slight angle, admiring his surroundings in pure glee. Any other night, he""d have donned a cap out of embarrassment to mask his balding cranium, but tonight was different. The stars were out. A warm, playful breeze dusted the bare ground. He and his wife had just been on a wonderful vacation. An aura of bliss was spread on the air like a lovely thick butter. He basked in it. ""Cheryl, you out yet?"" His gaze floated to the bright restrooms, that sat canopied against the neon by a cluster of palm trees. The doors had male and female aliens painted on them coinciding with the sex of the restroom. Nevada crickets chirped merrily against the peaceful backdrop. ""Damn,"" he mumbled, smiling. If he had to wait out here for another twenty minutes, he wouldn""t be too opposed. Dan Lemmings"" mind floated to that of baseball. His favorite player was Chuck Finley. Dan visualized himself in the place of Finley. The pale metal support beam he leaned on was a giant baseball bat. The copious trilling that the crickets swarmed him with at that very moment was rapturous applause. The pink flash of neon was a camera""s bulb. He chuckled. ""Danny?"" A woman meekly beckoned, emerging from the little aliens"" room. She clacked over to Dan, her purple pumps echoing eagerly off the cooled pavement. She gazed down briefly, straightening out her leather skirt, then smiled at Dan. ""Decor never gets old, eh?"" She joked, gesturing over to the restroom doors. After living in Reno, Nevada for nearly 15 years together, one can grow accustomed to the extraterrestrial aesthetic that store owners

""Can""t we just call in sick?"" Mulder asked, using his puppy dog face in full force. Scully gave him her signature glare. ""I know what that look means."" She rolled off the bed, heading in the direction of her bathroom. ""I""m getting a shower. Are you heading home first?"" Scully turned around asking, hand on her hip, ruffling the over hand through her short red locks. ""I can just shower here. Save time,"" Mulder said getting up, walking over to her and putting his arms around her waist. ""Save eyebrows from being raised.""

The girl probably wasn""t even the reason she was angry, since she had talked to that boy - Cain - her cell phone didn""t stop receiving the strange messages. It was almost always with a motivational or kind text. ""You""re not alone..."", ""A friend is waiting for you..."", ""Keep it up..."", ""Find me..."" The last message irritated her the most. Why did someone sending her such silly messages? What did this person mean by ""find me""? Questions were tearing through her mind rapidly and it was annoying her so she took a deep breath and sat back in her chair. One of the photo frames caught her attention. It was a really old one; the deep blue colour it had once shone with had all but faded. The front of the frame had been a deep blue colour but it had been faded away by the sunlight. So now it was only a paler, lighter blue, more gray than blue. The picture was also an old one, similar to the frame the picture was fading. However Yuki could still identify the people in it. The glass, which normally should protect the photo, was cold when Yuki touched it. She wasn""t sure why she kept it; she didn""t know what held her back when she wanted to throw it away. Maybe it was an old family treasure like the book in her red shelf. Her grandfather had told her that the author Takeru Takaishi should be in the photo, but even he had forgotten which of the children Takeru was. In the picture were twelve

Kaoru made his way silently over to his seat and sat on the desk to catch his breath. I wonder where Hikaru is hiding. I wish we could have finished our prank. It would have been fun. The goal of the prank was to make the seeker be forced to look through all the rooms since they were tampered with to make it look like someone had gone in there, so that they could make sure that there was no one hiding anywhere. Then they were going to purposely throw a rock or something into the rooms to make a sound and to make the person who was ""it"" go back to reexamine the room. Then when they got bored they were going to go into one of the rooms already checked and hide in separate spots so that they couldn""t be accused of hiding together. The plan was foolproof!

""Cause it""s like talking about sex in front of your parents. A very big no."" ""Fine."" She pouted again. After about five minutes, she roughly grabbed her boyfriend""s head and pulled him down in a very passionate kiss. She then shoved him away and grabbed her pants off of the floor and one of Derek""s shirts out of his drawer that said: ""I""m an Orangutan"". Derek also got changed, and then squirted on some cologne. ""Derek! Casey! Breakfast""s ready!"" His dad screamed up to them. Casey walked past Derek and started out of his room when he grabbed her arm and pulled her back. ""No drinking talk."" ""Huh?"" She asked, and he repeated himself. ""Whatever...k."" She said, and then started towards the stairs. Derek ran his hand through his hair. ""I""m not ready for our parents to find out about her drinking. And now starts Chapter One in Derek""s book of Rehab."" Derek quickly followed Casey downstairs and he watched her sit down at the counter. He quickly walked into the kitchen where he spotted Abby leaning over the stove cooking eggs, Lizzie and Edwin sitting dangerously close to each other, and Marti playing with a purple dinosaur. ""SMEREK!!"" She cried, jumping out of her seat and giving her brother a huge hug. Derek groaned in pain, but he picked her up anyways and spun her around. ""Hey, Smarti. How""s my favorite sister?"" ""Great!

Seconds after, the sound of something shattering startled him and made him jump. It landed him on his back with a loud thud, one that flung his eyes open and rendered him breathless and mindless. Dark. It was too dark. Way too dark. Oh god, he was still stuck there. No matter what he did - no matter what he said, it was always too fucking dark! Goddamnit. He said he""d be good.

Students looked so terrified that Haruhi could almost see the fear radiating off of them. Suddenly, a chair fell to the floor, and somebody screamed.

So this is what it""s like to work. To try and copy them, I held my head and chest high to try and make my posture perfect. In reality, I looked like a kid pretending to be a soldier.

Unable to move because Glefinnan stuffed up the space with boxes of machinery. By the age of twelve, all the children were strong and hardworking. My mother and father were smarter now and they managed to escape. They grew up and Glefinnan never found them. My mother and father developed a closer relationship, and had me. Sadily enough, the day after I opened my eyes father was captured by Glefinnan. My mother grew confused, broken, and angry. From then on, mother taught me the cruel lessons Glefinnan had taught mother. At the age of five, mother had made me lashed me severely for saying the word Glefinnan. I learned never to mention the word. You could say that mother learned Glefinna""s cruelty. The day before my sixth birthday, mother was taken away my cops for trying to steal me a birthday present. I lived in fright, too young to understand. I learned street smarts after some, let""s say unpleasant, encounters. Mother told me to always avoid other people, since she only knew bullies and Glefinnan. Rats soon became my good friends. I survived on my own in the streets of the harsh city environment. I understood my mother had been so afraid of other humans. On the day of my ninth birthday, Glefinnan came to visit me. He brought me a birthday present, saying he was harmless.

Anyway, thank you for reading and please review. Summer Snow See Disclaimer and Warning in chapter 1. Wei was attacking them. That fact alone should be able to raise extreme alarm among the ranks of Wu officers. The Kingdom of Wei had no small army and the latest report their spy had just conveyed with the utmost grimness had confirmed that. No less than a million of man force had built a gigantic camp at the north side of the Yellow River. True that the massive army had not made any movement since they had arrived yesterday night, but that did not mean they would only sit idly either. Knowing Sima Yi, there must be secret plans to follow, Lu Meng thought pensively. Their High Commander, General Zhou Yu, had been sporting a grim face throughout the day, which had never been a good sign among his officers. But he was skeptical that the commander""s mood would improve if he arrived and discovered the condition here at the meeting room. Or rather the atmosphere among his generals. Strategy meetings, Lu Meng reflected sadly, should be much more sincere and less hostile. Clack. That sound again. Lu Meng looked up from the fold of his hands just in time to catch Lu Xun throwing a glare to Ling Tong who in return regarded him with lazy, not-so-innocent eyes. They were engaged into a staring battle for a while before the younger of the two snorted and went back to his scroll.

We didn""t even set up the rollaway that the manager had brought over, just got ready for bed and crawled in together like an old married couple. He spooned around me and we dozed off; I woke up with us laying side by side on our backs with his arm under my head and our bodies touching from shoulder to ankle. I turned on my side away from him and he again curled around me, not waking up, and I lay there watching the room grow light and reveling in the feeling of his hard, strong body against mine. But that day ended up being a dealbreaker; between seeing Sheila kiss Mulder and my confession to her in the ladies"" room, I knew I was getting in too deep. Though I couldn""t bring myself to ask him to move to the rollaway bed, I stayed up reading long after he""d settled down to sleep and when I did, I made sure to stay well on my side. To my relief, I woke alone with Mulder already up and about. I did some serious thinking while in the shower and vowed not to share a bed with him in any way again until I sorted my feelings out. Mulder and I getting romantically involved was one of the worst ideas ever on many levels, and I wanted to take it slow and think our way through this before one of our innocent sleepovers ended up with us doing the naked pretzel despite ourselves, as Mulder so poetically put it.

""No, Agent Mulder. The local law enforcement will be able to take care of this one."" Mulder was highly skeptical of this, but said nothing.

She noticed how a lot shinobi were already there. And that still wasn""t all of them. All the ninja here looked far more tough than the ninja she saw stuck on the second floor. These were the ninjas she was expecting to see taking the exam. They were experienced shinobi and were willing to kill. She spotted the three sand siblings sitting a little further away. They still had thirty minutes before the start of the first exam. Ren wondered just what was waiting for her next. As they waited for the exam to start, the team could feel the tension in the air. Everyone eyeing the other, judging who would be slim pickings. The room silent which was understandable. Enemy territory surrounded by enemies, who wouldn""t be on edge. Even ninja from the same village could be a potential foe later on in the exam. For nearly half an hour, no one else came in. Probably all the others decided to take the guards advise and headed home. When someone did enter, all heads turned towards the door as newcomers entered. Ren and her team included. She was pleased to see Naruto""s team decided to take the exam. She wondered what held them up. Looking at Sakura""s face, Ren could tell the girl was already intimidated. Obivious to the tension in the air, a platinum blonde and her two teammates entered just behind them. Getting a better look, the girl had fair skin, blue eyes, and long platinum blonde hair worn in a ponytail extended to her waist, with bangs framing the right side of her face.

She twirls around and stops when she sees Mika Chew looking at us in disgust. All I know is that if I go in, I""m dead, no matter what. And Violet knows how to fight, so she is safe. I quickly turned around and watch me mom and dad talk with Haymitch Abernathy and Effie Trinket. ""You know, you""re lucky."" I hear someone say and look back on Kennedy Smart. I tried being friends with her, but she was just so pissed that I""m ""rich"" Which I am, don""t get me wrong, but it""s not like I show it off. Her hate grew for me when her sister was sent into the games two years ago and died- like I""m the one who killed her. ""I know."" I say lightly and turn back to the stage. I watch father and mother pin small microphones on each others shirts. Haymitch and Effie do the same. Father leans in and says something to mom and she rolls her eyes. ""Remember, we""re madly in love, so its all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it."" That""s what he said. Every time the cameras are around he says that. She used to laugh and say, ""I""ll keep that in mind."" But now she rolls her eyes. My mom knows how much Peeta truly loves her. Now it""s all up to my mom to make their marriage something other then a capitol""s making. Mayor Fret makes the same speech as last year and the year before that and the year before that, and so on. I pay attention when Effie comes to the stage. ""Happy Hunger Games,","{""output"": ""NO""}"
374,"Text1: ""Hey, Thresh!"" I call. He looks over, confused and somewhat angry. ""What?"" ""Come here."" He walks over cautiously, but not in a frightened way. ""What do you want?"" ""We""d like to offer you a position in our alliance,"" Glimmer tells him, giving a winning grin. He looks each of us over. ""What makes you think I""d want to team up with all of you?"" ""Well, you can clearly see we""re the strongest and most competent tributes. Why wouldn""t you want to join? It""s like that old saying, if you can""t beat them join them,"" Catalina glows. ""No thanks,"" Thresh grumbles, turning to walk away. ""You sure?"" Marvel calls. ""Positive."" ""What an idiot,"" Glimmer hisses. ""His loss,"" Marvel says, shaking his head. ""What""s going on?"" I spin my head to where that all too familiar voice came from, to find its owner, Clove. She looks at all of us, waiting for an answer. Everyone avoids eye contact, and before things get too awkward, Catalina tells her. Before anyone can suffocate from the tension in the air, we""re all called into the cafeteria to wait to be called for our private sessions with the Gamemakers. Marvel is called first and nearly cries when he has to let go of Glimmer""s hand. When he""s out of earshot, she lets out a sigh of relief, then grabs my thigh under the table. I give her an angry look, and she smiles flirtatiously in return. Thankfully, she""s called in and I let out a sigh of relief before she""s out of earshot. She whips her head around and smiles again. I""m left with about five minutes to figure out exactly what I""m going to do to wow the Gamemakers. About four minutes into planning, I toss out all my thoughts and decide to wing it.

Text2: Simon ran off to tell Rythian whatever he had just said as he sipped his coffee. He didn""t see what the rush was about. He closed his eyes for a minute and sighed as he heard Simon""s heavy footsteps approaching, ""Yes."" He said upon entering the room. ""What?"" Lewis replied, his memory had failed him. ""There is a breathable atmosphere, only uh- 23% Oxygen""""Oh right. Okay, we need to prepare to orbit."" Lewis went to drink the last of his coffee before realising he had already drunk all of it. He stretched and rubbed his eyes again. ""I need to sort out my sleeping routine."" He said to himself, pacing once again to the control room, feeling much more sentient. ""Okay Rythian, give me some numbers."" He said with a smile, standing a pace behind him. Rythian chuckled lightly, ""Had a nice sleep Xeph?"" He joked. He heard no response and looked at Lewis who appeared to take no notice of his snide comment. ""We are not sure whether it is inhabited, we are too far away to get a full diagnostic but we-"" ""Need to get into orbit, I know, Simon told me."" Lewis finished, moving to the controls to input a new trajectory. ""Right- okay. I assume you can take it from here."" Rythian said and took a step back. ""I wouldn""t mind a hand, the ship isn""t made for one person."" He said quietly. Rythian smiled, Lewis hadn""t asked him to help steer the ship before, he hadn""t understood anything but while he was asleep Rythian had taken the time to read up as much as he could on the ship. ""Anything I can do you can do better."" Rythian stated, he was happy to help but he wasn""t sure why he was. ""No, no no. You""ve","{""output"": ""NO""}"
375,"Text1: Nanami sat across from her mother that morning at breakfast, picking at her crepes as her mother tsked at Tamaki""s sudden appearance. ""I don""t know what you""re talking about,"" Nanami grumbled, twisting a piece of her tucking a wisp of long blonde hair up into its normal bun. ""Come now, dearest. Relations with a flirtatious boy like Tamaki would simply ruin your career! Your mind would wander, your practice time would decrease rapidly-"" ""I don""t have relations with him, mother. He was just being nice, that""s all,"" Nanami spoke up a bit louder, but continued to stare blankly at her food. ""Sweet heart, I just don""t want you to get hurt! We know about Tamaki""s activities at school... he has a bit of a reputation, and I don""t think someone like you could-"" ""Mother!"" ""Just because you""ve taken an interest in Suou Tamaki, doesn""t mean he""s taken an interest in you."" Nanami bit her tongue uncharacteristically and bowed her head. Why was her mother treating her like this? She had barely met Tamaki last week, and her mother could practically see the heart break! ""May I be excused?"" Nanami snapped unintentionally, rising from the table without a response. She arrived at her piano lesson slightly bitter, only to be notified that her usually callous and untactful teacher had caught pneumonia and would be out for quite some time, or course, her parents, not accepting defeat, had hired a surrogate for the time being. When the teacher who was filling in arrived, Nanami was startled as she sat behind her piano wearing a plain pink satin and lace skirt with a white cashmere sweater, her hair up in its ritualistic bun. ""You must be Nanami. I""m Kazuya."" Nanami found her blue eyes glued to the new teacher. The complete opposite of

Text2: Pain spread through Emmett""s body like wildfire. He dropped Violet immediately to the floor and gripped his head, attempting to stifle an unbearable heat of it inside him. Marcus was using Jane""s ability to persuade him to leave. ""Please stop! You""re hurting him,"" Violet begged at Marcus"" feet as Emmett doubled over, his fists clenched and his eyes snapped shut in anguish. Violet trembled at the sight before once more imploring Marcus to release him. ""Don""t do this! I""ve done all you asked!"" she began to cry desperately, trying to console Emmett with whispered words of devotion. Please Emmett, please leave now. I promise we""ll be together soon, just- ""GO!"" she screamed loudly, snapping Jane out of her fixation on Emmett and blinked disbelievingly at the passion this sad, human just displayed. The two guards left as soon as the word was spoken, knowing their job was done. ""I trust you can see yourself out,"" Marcus chuckled coldly as the large vampire lay in a crumpled heap on the floor. ""You knew I could""ve persuaded him! Why did you have to hurt him like that?"" Violet""s unsteady voice cracked as she tried to shake off the pain she herself felt from Emmett""s mental torture. Although Jane""s power didn""t actually inflict lasting damage at small doses, she knew that Emmett, who didn""t have mental abilities like Edward, couldn""t stymie such pain off for more than a moment or two. ""He wouldn""t have left without you. You should know by now that you""re connection to him as an Immortal is impossible to resist. You""ll start feeling the effects of his absence in a few days, too, I""m sure of that."" Marcus remarked nonchalantly, as he led Violet back to her room. ""It was the only way,"" he said finally, closing the door","{""output"": ""YES""}"
376,"Text1: But Ohio was closest to New York. He had a spare set of clothes there, an identity he could take with him and some extra cash. Not that he would leave them out in the open; they were tucked away safely in an armed safe. If he was ever on the run, he needed workable back-up plans. When he was a contract killer, he""d had a few too many times when his employers turned on him and he had no where to disappear and lay low. So he purchased his first safe house as soon as he got a gig in Peru -he bought his Nevada safe house. Back at his apartment in New York, he used to keep his spare cash tucked under his mattress. Despite what Nat said when she found out, he was not an eighty year old woman. He just liked having cash on hand and it wasn""t as though he left his apartment unlocked and inviting for thieves. Just because she could break in, didn""t mean it was... the worst plan ever. Except for the part where his apartment had been crushed under a giant alien and his money was probably long gone by now. Clint winced. So maybe it hadn""t been the best plan. At his first gas station stop, Clint checked through his wallet and made sure he would have enough cash to last him to Ohio. He wouldn""t. He used his personal credit card for each gas stop until he was in the middle of Pennsylvania before he switched to cash and drove to Ohio. By the time he got to his apartment, he was half starved and ready to pass out again so that was the first thing he did. The couch wasn""t the most comfortable one, but it was better

Text2: Clint hummed under his breath, eyes shut and hands behind his head. He could hear Scott start to pick up the beat, tapping on his stool. Wanda hadn""t said anything in hours or days. He""d tried getting her to talk, but she wasn""t. Damn Tony for putting them in a place like this. For putting her here, and damn the government for getting them in this mess. Sam hadn""t said much since Tony had shown up -but Clint had heard him having a panic attack afterwards. Clint glanced over when he registered movement at the cell bars, a guard walking by, baton smacking against the bars, a warning. Clint sat up, measuring the guard""s movements, singing louder. It wasn""t like he was planning an escape. That would be impossible, even for the most bastardly of prisoners held here. But he couldn""t help it. He wanted a reaction. He wanted a fight. The Raft was the place where they kept the worst of the worst cooped up. The Abomination was stored here, for Christ""s sake. What did that say about them? They hadn""t killed anyone. They hadn""t murdered or stolen anything. Standing against the government, standing for what was right was what got them here? Clint glared at the wall, belting out the lyrics. He wasn""t going to stop. They""d have to make him. And if they made him -if they did something like that, well, he wasn""t sure what next. Because if they used force to make him comply, they were no better than Hydra. They were no better than any other low-level scum out there. The baton slammed against the bars more firmly and Clint definitely caught a glare that time around.

She finds herself in District 4 trying to adapt to their culture and avoid being sent to the Capitol where her destiny as an Avox is certain. She trains at the Career Academy and is put under the instructor of Finnick Odair who is frustrated with her lack of abilities native to the District. President Snow is becoming more and more unstable and with the 75th Hunger Games coming up who knows what will happen? Katniss""s body ached. She forced herself to roll over onto her stomach and she struggled to push herself up. She looked around briefly before turning quickly to empty the few contents of her stomach. Bodies. The bodies were burnt to the skeleton. The charred bones contained some flesh that made the air smell putrid. The heavy smoke in the air made her eyes water and she coughed. ""Prim?"" She coughed, as she started frantically lifting debris near where her home was. ""Primrose?"" Bits of ash swirled in the cold wind and piles created chimneys. Dust bunnies filled the roads that once were filled with people and corpses laid everywhere. Katniss lifted one more piece of wood before she saw the body. Her heart pounded against her ribcage painfully and her sense of dread filled her. She screamed as she pulled Prim""s lifeless body against her holding her close. Fat tears rolled down her cheeks as she held her little sister close. The Mockingjays mocked her cries of agony into an almost beautiful song. Katniss stayed there for what felt like hours. The thought of leaving Prim was too much for her. She knew that she was now alone. Her mother was an empty shell for years. Countless times Katniss had to pull

I open the door to the apartment and inside is a beautiful living room. The floor is plush carpet, and it""s springy and soft. The apartment is a split-level, and the dining table is sitting on the upper level. Bright orange chairs surround the table. On the lower level are squashy armchairs that are colored purple and blue. I literally sink into one and close my eyes. ""Would you like to see your rooms?"" Glow asked Borax and me. I jumped out of the chair and followed Glow down a wide hallway. The first door on the left held my room. Glow opened the door and ushered me in. She then left to show Borax his room. I looked around the spacious room. The carpet was a light spring green and it seemed the whole room was focused around the theme of nature. The walls were a sky blue, the bed was large and had a blanket that looked like grass. There was a small remote on the bedside table, so I picked it up and pressed the first of four buttons on it. I noticed a window across from the bed change from the city street to a meadow. I clicked the second button and the screen changed to a field of flowers blowing in the wind. I kept the setting on this view and changed into comfortable clothes. Glow came in a few minutes later to tell me that training started tomorrow, and that I should get some rest. I climbed into the bed and fell asleep right away. No dreams haunted my sleep tonight. The next thing I knew I was

Text2: The warmth of the cup is a welcome touch to my hands. The rich smell of the hot chocolate causes me to smile a little. Yet, it doesn""t stop the butterflies that have taken root in my stomach. After my morning shower I find an outfit laid out on my bed. It is simple in design, a pair of fairly tight trousers and a slightly baggier, long sleeved top. On the left sleeve and back of my outfit is the number seven. The dark forest green stands out against my black outfit. I assume the number is there in case I should forget where I am from. How considerate of the Capitol. I""m not from here, just a lowly person from the districts. Clearly nothing but a simpleton. Speaking of simpletons, in comes Crimson.

But when he opened his eyes the ground was far beneath him. In fact, somehow both of them had ended up above the trees, with Karkat clinging to John""s leg for dear life. John""s face lifted as he took in what was around him with pure amazement. ""Karkat! Look! We""re flying!"" Karkat wrapped himself tighter on John""s leg. ""No fucking shit, now fly us out of here!"" The wind, it felt so great! It was like he was free. Yet half of John""s mind screamed that this wasn""t possible, and that humans could not fly. After that realization, his heart sank. With this information, he could only confirm that all of this was just a dream, and tomorrow morning he would wake up to Casey glubbing at him with intense bubble action. And this Karkat guy, he was also just a dream, but despite that John still felt that he had to save the both of them. Karkat tightened his grip on John""s leg. ""Hey Dumbass!

"" there is something we have been keeping from you, I never was a human, I just turned one.I""m a half-demon. Damnit all, I thought this would never happen"" Inuyasha paused and Kiasha froze thinking back to her choir songs, and some were about demons. Could it be that demons truly did exsist. Actually, they had to! It was kind of obvious. ""So what am I?"" Kagome sighed ""actually you are a quarter demon."" Kiasha looked up ""I seriously doubt a demon could hide themselves in tokyo"" she ket out a loud sigh as if to tell them just how confusing this was. Inuyasha got up ""We can not stay in Tokyo we must go back"" Kiasha looked at him, ""Back where?"" Kagome was already packing a bag filed with fooods band-aids and such. Kagome got Up ""Kiasha follow me"" Kiasha followed her parents until they reached the well house. ""I""m not aloud in there"" she thought.

But, undeniably, the greatest discovery of his life was Dana Scully herself. And that had brought more warmth, and caring, and love than he ever could have dared hope for. True, things were not always...pleasant between them, and there had been many bumps, wedges, difficulties, and plenty of hurt along the way, but the respect, value, and reverence they both placed on their relationship was outranked only by the deep, true, abiding love. Except maybe my blatant lust! Whether they were actually cohabiting or not...he knew he simply couldn""t exist and be truly happy without having some sort of relationship with her.

The outline of Stark""s Pond was hardly visible in the dim moonlight. After entering the clearing of trees I sat down on the wooden bench facing the frozen pond, amazingly not covered by snow. I sighed, putting my elbows on my knees and my chin in my hands. What was I going to do now? As a bitter reminder I brushed my finger over my bruised eye, flinching at the pain. That was probably the most annoying of the injuries I had gotten last night, but not the worst. And there was no way I was going to willingly touch my back. I knew how badly it was hurt.

I packed my bags and ran as fast as I could to get away from the things that haunted me. I neep help. I""m not okay. What have I done? I need to go. My bags are packed, I""m sitting at the bus station, trying to escape my personal Hell on Earth. The world spins madly on, regardless of how much I wanted it to stop and turn back. My name is Harper Lewis, and I was abducted by the Joker when I was twenty-three years old. Let""s take it back to a few days before that fateful encounter. Winter break has just ended, and unfortunately I was back at Gotham University for the last of my sophomore year. I was studying to be a nurse. ""...Now I""m not saying he should be tortured, I just think the only way to contain this guy is the death penalty. I mean, come one, he""s escaped from Arkham what, five times in the last three years? Who""s to say he""s ever going to stay in there?"" I sat down at the table in the student lounge, just as Cassidy finished her rant. ""I don""t know if we should go to that extent. Maybe if they put him in prison with a few of the thugs to teach him a lesson, but death?"" Her boyfriend, Daniel, added. ""He""s killed literally hundreds of people. I don""t think roughing him up will help, the man""s insane. Harper, what

But if he comes in here crying, I blame you."" ""WHERE""S MY HARUHI?"" Ranka yelled pretty much taking the door off it""s hinges and knocking the nurse down. Haruhi just shot a death glare at Tamaki and straightened her face out to face her hysterical father. ""WHAT HAPPENED? IF YOU HURT MY DAUGHTER SO HELP ME--"" ""Nothing happened, we were just eating lunch in the park and these guys came around with knives trying to be macho. They thought it""d be fun to cut me so they did. I only got a few stitches it""s fine."" ""HOW CAN YOU BE SO CALM?"" ""Well, to tell you the truth I wasn""t gonna tell you in the first place."" ""How could you? My own daughter! Hiding things from me!"" ""Well if it""s to keep you quiet then yes. Dad, seriously, I think even the people in the morgue can hear you. Now can everyone just leave, I""m really tired."" Haruhi said before the nurse ushered everyone but Tamaki out. ""I really am sorry."" ""It""s fine as long as you don""t tell anyone else."" ""You don""t have to be so level headed. You almost died."" ""Well I didn""t. I don""t see a reason to freak out if I""m fine. I don""t see why you""re so worried."" ""Because I almost lost the thing most important to me. If they had killed you, I would have asked them to kill me."" ""Don""t talk like that."" Haruhi said,","{""output"": ""YES""}"
384,"Text1: A small amused and sadistic grin crept up to Cato""s lips as he turned his head to actually look at her. He hadn""t really been able to see her in quite a long time despite training together everyday. Her strawberry blonde hair had grown out, it was tied up in a messy ponytail, bangs clipped away from her face. She was quite pretty, Cato thought. There was just this sadistic look in her eyes all the time, and for someone reason, in Cato""s messed up head, that made her pretty. It was why he became friends with her in the first place, the things he did that most people found scary and disturbing, she found amusing and funny. He snorted. ""Yeah."" Jea laughed a bit before speaking again. ""So, listen. We""re having that stealth test on Friday, right?"" she started and Cato let out a silent sigh, of course she needed something. She wasn""t really the kind to approach someone just for a conversation, Cato knew all too well. ""Hm?"" ""And I was wondering if you could come over and help me tomorrow. Y""know, I kinda"" really need it and Zoey said you""d be the best choice so, why not,"" he finished and looked at him expectantly. As much as he hated the shining expectant eyes on him he didn""t really want to refuse. Not because he wanted to help a friend out, but because it was an opportunity to show of, though he would never admit that to himself. ""Yeah, sure. I""m up for it,"" he gave a small smile before making an excuse to jog away, he wasn""t really in the mood to chitchat with anyone. He thought about the agility thing the whole way back to his room. It seemed too... simple for a girl like Jea.

I take a deep breath while Peeta plays a few more chords and finish: Deep in the meadow, Hidden far away, A cloak of leaves, A moon beam ray, Forget your woes, And let your troubles lay, And when again morning comes, They will wash away, Here it""s safe, Here it""s warm, Here the daisies guard you from every harm, Here your dreams are sweet, And tomorrow brings them true, Here is the place where I love you. The song is finally finished so, I open my eyes and see everybody in the class staring and gaping at me. This makes me very uncomfortable, so I look over at Peeta and see that he is looking at me the same way, but different. I don""t even know how to describe his expression. Admiration? No, it seems much more than that. All of this attention is making me squirm and I don""t like it. ""What?"" I ask. There is no reply; even Cashmere is silent and wide-eyed. After about another minute, Cinna breaks out of what someone could only describe as trance that everyone is in. ""Katniss that was....that....was beautiful. You""ve rendered everybody speechless. Where did you learn how to sing like that?"" he says softly, his voice filled with amazement. ""My father,"" I say simply, slightly smiling at the thought of him. ""Wow, just wow. That""s great. As much as I have loved hearing you sing, this is a class so I""m afraid you must sit back down and listen to the others."" ""Okay, thank you,"" I say while tugging a still gaping Peeta","{""output"": ""NO""}"

She sighed, laying down, holding Terriermon in her arms and above her. She stared up curiously up at him, saying, ""It must be hard to pretend you""re a doll all the time."" Terriermon resisted the urge to talk, thinking, ""She knows!?' ""You don""t have to pretend around me."" Katrina went on, ""I""m okay with you being real and all, Terriermon."" Terriermon stayed silent, ""Still not talking, huh?"" Katrina flopped over so Terriermon was sitting on her pillow and she was staring at him, ""Maybe a laugh?"" Katrina tackled him, wiggling her fingers over him, tickling him. Terriermon held out for awhile, but found that it was impossible. He began to squirm, laughing loudly. Katrina laughed along with him, ""See? Isn""t that much better?"" ""Hey, how""d you know?"" Terriermon asked. ""I saw you walking into Henry""s bedroom after you fell of his shoulder."" Katrina stated. Terriermon pouted, ""Suzie was oblivious for months, and the first day you come here and you already find out."" ""Don""t be sad,"" Katrina lightly poked his tummy. Terriermon began to laugh again. ""I""m not sad!"" Terriermon said, ""Now I don""t have to pretend to be a doll again!"" ""Terriermon!"" Henry said in a reprimanding tone, ""What did I tell you about exposing yourself!?"" ""Uh oh..."" Terriermon said. ""I guess you know now,"" Henry said. ""It""s not his fault."" Katrina said, ""I""m the one who found out."" ""And you""re actually okay with this?"" ""I""ve met a digimon before,"" Katrina said, her eyes taking on an almost nostalgic look, ""Compared to his attitude at first...Terriermon is a lot more polite."" Katrina giggled. ""Huh?"" Henry and Terriermon said together.

Text2: ""Don""t be mean."" Ginny stated. ""Do you mind moving?"" A sharp and familiar voice spoke behind them. They turned to see Draco, his things being pushed by a servant. ""Unlike you blathering idiots, I don""t want to be late for the train. Now, move."" Draco and his servant pushed past the four and on to the gateway to Platform 93⁄4. A moment later and Draco was joined by Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. Draco wasted no time in detaching himself from the pesky group, disappearing without another word to them towards the luggage area, his servant following. ""Well that was weird."" Ron stated, ""Usually he""d say something more than ""Move"" to us."" ""Hermione!"" A voice called above the crowd. A girl suddenly emerged from the sea of people, already dressed in her black robes. She seemed urgent, and her face expressed worry. Her hair was dark black, a bit wavy, and reached slightly past her shoulders. Eyes, deep and understanding, were a shining cross between aqua, aquamarine, and cerulean. ""Ziba?"" Hermione questioned. Ziba ran up to Hermione, panting hard as if she""d been running for a while now, ""Hermione, have you any idea where my younger sister Chaele is? We got separated in the crowd, and I can""t find her!"" ""Calm down!"" Hermione said, calming her frantic friend down. ""Who""s she?"" Ron questioned. Harry kicked his friend in the shin. Ginny giggled. ""We just got here, but we haven""t seen Chaele."" Hermione said. ""What""s she look like?"" Harry asked. ""She""s shorter than us, because she""s going to be a first year at Hogwarts this year. She""s got really long, light black hair, the tips a sunny brunette with the same colored highlights too.

Levi""s eyes widened as he stared at his brother, seeming at a loss for words. Eren had actually spoken. Was he dreaming? The younger boy was starting to feel embarrassed by Levi""s shocked silence, so he looked away, his cheeks tinted red. And then, he felt an affectionate hand ruffle his hair in that familiar fashion, and Eren looked up to meet Levi""s eyes again. His brother had a smirk on his face, one that showed pride and a certain degree of happiness that reached his normally cold eyes. Eren stared as Levi put his hand down and instead, placed it on the doorknob. ""Just ""Levi"" is fine, brat."" He said, before stepping out and closing the door behind him. ""Eren! Get up and get your shit together, we have school today!"" Eren groaned a long, drawn out ""no"" as he took his pillow and put it over his head to block out the world around him. The pillow was promptly yanked off his head and flung to the ground with an angry growl. ""I swear, Eren, if you make us late I will personally neuter you."" Suddenly, Eren was sitting up, meeting the hostile glare of his brother. Levi sighed. ""Who knew that going through puberty would make you even more difficult...and ridiculously tall.""

Text2: The swordsman immediately took action, his instincts taking over. In a flash, he was standing next to Shiro and with a swift movement, he pulled Shiro""s body in so that it was flat against the front of his own. This made him easier to protect as Kuroh drew his wooden sword with the hand that wasn""t holding the other boy to his chest. With several quick slashes through the air, Kuroh shattered the prop, knocking it aside. It fell into pieces around them as students in the surrounding area flocked to the site to see if they were alright. Shiro blinked as he stood there, not really sure what had happened. Then he noticed the soft fabric that he was clutching. Looking up, Shiro came to see Kuroh, his face calm as he stood there, still holding his sword aloft. Looking at him like this, Shiro could finally see what Kuroh had referred to himself as. He could see the noble samurai. After a moment, Kuroh looked down and their eyes met. For some reason, Shiro""s cheeks turned slightly pink. ""Are you alright?"" Kuroh asked as he released him. Shiro stared at him for a moment. ""Uh, yes. Thank you."" Kuroh was now walking home from kendo, his sword at his side, when he sensed that someone was following him. Who would be out here in the middle of the night besides him? Discreetly, he laid his hand on the hilt of his sword. Then, with barely any warning at all, he drew it and wheeled around at the stranger . . . only to stop short as he was met with a certain idiotic smile. Shiro stood there, his parasol clutched in one of the hands that he was holding up in surrender. ""Hi, Kuroh."" He said weekly. ""Do","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Ash smiled down at his partner, ""I""m okay, Pikachu,"" the mouse Pokemon didn""t look convinced, ""Really, I just needed to clear my head."" He stood and rotated his shoulder, rolling out the kinks, and pulled Charizard""s pokeball off of his belt. He tossed it into the air, and the giant flying lizard appeared in a flash of white light. Charizard looked at Ash with eyes filled with confusion and anger. Not anger at Ash, he realized, but at Damian. ""I think we need to show Damian what an idiot he was to treat you like he did.

The room was sweltering; since they were supposed to be in the desert, Tamaki had decided to raise the heat in the room to 95 degrees in order to make is seem more...authentic. Not to mention that sand blanketed the entire floor. Then, thanks to a misplaced bun-bun, Haruhi tripped, spilling two pitchers of iced tea and earning herself another 20 clients added to her debt, as well as clean up duty. Therefore, Hunny and Mori had left as soon as the club had ended. They had to attend one of Mori""s kendo matches. Kyoya was at his desk, hunched over his computer as his fingers flew over the keys; he was obviously scheming up a new plot to get money for the club.

Haruhi had just finished packing up the last of the costumes and putting them in the storage room.

Edward slammed the driver""s door shut and opened mine in seconds. After throwing me over his shoulder like a sack of flour, he sped off into the forest like a bullet, towards the clearing. Since he didn""t give me time to close my eyes, (and the fact that his shoulder was lodged into my stomach didn""t help) when he set me down I tumbled to the ground dizzily and laid my cheek on the cool, slightly damp grass. I felt his hand rub soothing circles on my back, and I sighed, letting my stomach settle. ""I""m sorry, Bella. I guess I forgot to warn you."" he chuckled. ""Yeah, yeah. Sure you forgot."" I grumbled, but his melodic laughter instantly melted away my anger. I slowly sat up and looked into his now bright, mirthful eyes. The serenity didn""t last long, though, as his features hardened and his golden eyes changed to a dark amber color that I found hauntingly beautiful. His voice was firm with a hint of annoyance. ""How many times have we gone over this?"" He stood swiftly and silently. ""Three-hundred and sixty-four."" I replied sarcastically. I rose as well, though not nearly as gracefully as he had. Edward didn""t find it amusing. He grasped my upper arms tightly, lifting me a few inches off the ground. He was about to start arguing when he saw me wince in pain. He put me down gently and let go, quickly averting his gaze. ""Sorry,"" he mumbled, ""but I refuse to change you, Bella."" ""But why!?"" He glared at me, getting angrier by the moment.

I realized that I couldn""t manage to look at my family""s expressions. Unexplainably, I didn""t really care at the moment. My thoughts racing past me, not giving me time to think about each one, they were almost as if they were uncontrollable. I also realized that it meant that I had to go up to the stage, and stood up stiffly, and face unreadable. I needed to make sure that no one knew how I was feeling. How was I feeling? Not exactly shocked, but not exactly nervous, and definitely not happy or excited. I searched for a word, describing my feeling. Once I reached the stage, I found it. Numb. I felt numb. I begged God of whoever was up there in the heavens to have someone volunteer for her. Anyone. Please? My wish was greeted with silence and shocked faces. Maybe this was a dream, I thought, knowing it wasn""t true. Doll patted my back confirming my doubt. ""Our male tribute is..."" Fishing for a slip she squinted her eyes in concentration. The slowly opened the paper for dramatic effect. At the name she did a double take. ""Our male tribute is Wellins Ellison."" She even looked shocked. Hesitantly she continued her cheerful banter a little carefully. ""Well, looks like we have a brother-sister tribute, don""t we? Fun!"" I blinked rapidly a couple of times, the words sinking in, giving me the true meaning. Wellins? Our Wellins? He was barely 13! I glanced over at my parents"" faces.

Little Aria had gotten a 9 in training and I found myself wondering how she did it, but came up blank. I didn""t see her do anything in the training room. And she seemed so tiny and fragile. She was twelve after all. Then I remembered how I comforted her with Jake and wondered how she was holding up from the death of her brother. And then I began to miss Jake too. He was so protective of her. He was her best friend. Then I wondered how she took the news of his death. Worse than me, I""d imagine. I looked down at Rose and Liam and prayed they would make it further than me. They were tough. How could I kill anyone in this arena? Even the careers.

She nodded, and he stormed away. Angel was sitting in the common room of the royal quarters when her father stormed in, dragging Aaron by his ear. ""You bastard,"" he hissed at him, and Aaron flinched. ""What were you thinking?"" Aaron stared in shock as he was thrown to the ground. ""If anyone found out that my own son was running away... It would ruin me! How dare you?"" the king screamed. ""I-I-I,"" Aaron muttered nonsensically. The king slapped him, sending him sprawling. ""I will kill you if you try anything like that again, you got that?"" he hissed, and Aaron nodded, his eyes filling with tears.

They had reason to; it isn""t exactly normal for four people on a broomstick, one of which is unconscious, to crash on your table and ruin all your food. Nancy noted that this table had students with little badges that said ""Hufflepuff"" with a badger on them. Earlier she saw that Fred and George had these badges too, except with a lion and ""Gryffindor"" on it. Suddenly the bearded man yelled, ""SIIIIIIIIIILENCE!!"" Everyone fell silent. The greasy-haired man came over. ""Well, well, well, if it isn""t the Weasley twins,"" Greasy Hair said in triumph. ""I think a little detention is in order here."" ""DETENTION?"" Fred hollered.

He awoke at dawn, as usual. Ignoring the fiery light pouring in from the window, he set about his business. It was not the light that had awakened him; by his internal clock it was time, and so he rose. As silent as a breath of wind, he then slipped out of the room. Padding lightly down the steps, he turned and followed a darkened corridor. The lack of light didn""t seem to affect him, either; without need for a guiding handhold, he strode onward confidently. His eyes glittered cat-like in the gloom, milky-white like twin moons. Finally he reached his destination: the front door. Expert hands flitted over the lock, then he paused to listen for any noise in the household. Once outside, he exhaled the breath he had been holding, a puff of fog hovering by his face. He stood a moment facing the house, as though gathering himself, one hand on the door handle, the other clenching a navy bandana. Slowly, he released his vice grip on the handle, reaching up to set the band on his forehead. He tucked the ends under a mane of long hair, swiftly tying them. Once satisfied with the secure tightness of the bandana round his head, he turned and blinked in the flood of warm sunlight. It caressed his tired features and danced in his pale eyes. He stepped off the porch, taking in his surroundings. A vast field descended to the receding shadows of the woodland forest that bordered","{""output"": ""YES""}"

She stepped out into the hall and was surprised to find him waiting. He stood with his right shoulder pressed firmly against the wall; his hands held tightly within his pockets.

Each time his fingers grazed her skin - over her kneecaps, along the outside of her hips, her waist - electricity shot through his nerves, straight to his chest and brain. Despite the emotional detachment he was forcing upon himself, his heart beat faster; his breathing became more shallow. The proximity was almost unbearable. He was about to stand, to begin their desperate trek back to the surface, when he caught sight of toes peering from the bottom of the too-long pants. He looked at them for an instant - really looked at them. Pale pink iridescent paint caught the gleam of the green lighting. Mulder""s brow crinkled. He had never placed Scully as the type to paint her nails such a girly color. He could scarcely remember her ever wearing the color. Momentarily forgetting himself, he touched her big toe. God, it was cold, and he was suddenly sick at the thought of exposing such perfect little pink nubs to the snow. What had he been thinking? He ripped the boots from his feet and peeled off his thick grey wool socks. Somehow, they were warm and dry. He slipped them over her toes, regretting the loss of the pink splash of color. Mulder pulled his own boots back over his bare feet. The numbing cold crept quickly into his boots, a dampness proving even more uncomfortable. His cold feet brought back a fleeting childhood memory.

I clicked on the video named under the night of the winter formal and, out of curiosity, I decided to watch it before deleting it, just to see what the whole thing was about. The video showed Lydia walking towards the center of the Lacrosse field wearing her winter formal dress, apparently looking for something or someone. Suddenly, the lights surrounding the field were turned on, and an adult man -pretty creepy, I may add- appeared in the picture, walking towards Lydia. The camera focused on the man, and I couldn""t hold a loud gasp when he began growing a pair of huge, terrifying fangs. The man bit Lydia and her dress was covered in blood and dirt as she fell to the ground unconscious. I put a hand on my mouth, eyes widened in horror staring blankly at the computer screen, not believing my sight. Who the hell was that man? Better yet, what the hell was that man?

Text2: Herobrine was not happy with the new changes Notch had made, and he felt something for the first time : Hatred. His heart was filled with it, So much that his eyes turned glowing white. Finally it was time to leave, so Herobrine used almost all of his energy to travel to the Aether. When he got there he and notch had an incredible fight, of which Notch barely won. After sending his brother back Notch finally began to feel bad for what he did, so he tought to himself : I""m going to make a brother called Steve. He made the Steve look Exactly like Herobrine used to be before hatred turned his eyes white, but the difference was: It wasnt a god, Steve was just a mortal. Steve was very different on the inside than Herobrine. Steve was more of a simple man, so he and notch didn""t go very well. Both Steve and Notch were very bored, for there wasn""t anyone for notch to create with, and steve had nothing to do, for all he could do was play with cobblestone,So Notch decided to create another god: Jeb.

I roamed around my ""spawn area"" for awhile until I got frustrated and hit the tree nearest to me. A block of wood broke off, and levitated on the wood underneath it. I went closer to examine it, when it flew towards a pouch on my hip. I opened the pouch to see the little block, levitating at the bottom, so I took it out and held it. I looked on the side of the pouch to see a 2x2 table, with each place the size of the levitating blocks(this is kinda hard to describe :/). I took the pouch strap off my shoulder and placed it on the ground, and put the wood block on a square. A new block appeared on a square beside the 2x2 so I picked it up, and the oak disappeared. I now had 4 ""wooden planks"", so I decided to do the process again, and I came up with a crafting table. Apparently I could make more stuff with this 3x3 table I had received. ""Now what do I do..."" I decided to take a break for awhile, to see if I could think of anything. Around five minutes later, I was disturbed by the sheep I had seen before. I pushed it away, but it came right back to eating my shirt, so I punched it, and it turned red and started running in circles after returning to its normal colour. I got up and followed it, punching it over and over again, until it fell over and poofed into smoke. I was rewarded with 2 blocks of wool, and they flew into my pouch.

""Um, sounds great, mom."" ""Your mother totally forgot about a dinner for work tonight,"" Mr. Yagami told them. He was straightening his tie, and was seemingly grateful to be able to avoid his wife""s infamous cooking. ""We""ll be home around midnight."" He began to pull Mrs. Yagami towards the door again. Taichi and Hikari nodded, and said good-bye. Once they had left, he turned to his sister again. Hikari swallowed hard. ""I know it sounds stupid, but those dreams feel so real and everything.

Fuu opened her mouth to say something more, but stopped. The woman who was lying at her bent knees had gone perfectly still. Sawn""s face was a pasty gray, perpetual frown playing upon her blue lips. Her eyes were closed to the world. Sawn was dead, and Fuu had not been able to do a damn thing to prevent it. The Magic Knight squeezed her eyes shut tightly behind her wire-rimmed glasses, which she then removed to wipe the accumulating tears. Sawn had said not to take saving her life personally. ""I""m obliged . . .' Fuu didn""t care what rationale under which her life had been salvaged.

My eyes shot wide open and I started to push him away, but his arms slid around my waist, not letting me go. I start to panic and my body becomes stiff as my brain tries to fervently think of something to do...anything to get him off of me.

Levi was breathing hard and his eyes darted around his surrounding, clawing at any idea to save her. He had to do something before his magic was completely gone. Closing his own eyes, Levi roared with rage, focusing all of his remaining magic on his hand. It gathered in a burst of light that had Levi ricocheting away from Eren, his soul thrown away from the girl. He fell into the dark, his soul still glowing, and he looked back. Eren""s soul was almost black but there was faint light. She was surrounded by double the chains; the chains of the black magic. But before Levi could do anything, he was falling straight through the earth. Falling, falling, into a sea of black. ""Levi,"" a voice echoed through Levi""s consciousness. It was distant and hard to hear. ""Come on,"" the voice continued, growing louder, ""Wake up!"" Levi""s eyes shot open and he gasped in a deep breath, fighting for the loss of air. His stomach heaved with the effort and he turned on his side, clutching at his middle, and pressed his face into deep snow. It felt heavenly on his hot, flushed face. ""Oh, Levi, thank God."" Levi tilted his head toward the sound and slowly opened his eyes. His blurry vision revealed a figure leaning over him. He blinked. ""Hangi?"" he asked weakly. Her figure came into view and she was covered in snow with fear covering her brown eyes. She was shivering. ""What happened?"" he slurred, looking to his other side. His breath caught. Eren was lying directly to his right with snow glittering across her hair. Jean kneeled over her, looking devastated. Erwin and Petra were standing above him,

Hikaru shrugged and continued to watch the slow-moving elderly man, limping his way down the dirty street. He was merely ten feet away from them, so they held themselves still. The old man had wispy white hair on his balding head. His tired eyes were rimmed with broken glasses settled on his nose. And lesions covered his body. The old man coughed roughly into his loose-hanging shirt and blood spattered up onto his white and red checkered sleeve. Haruhi flinched away, averting her eyes. ""Can""t we find another way around?"" Tamaki hissed under his breath as he looked at the man in horror. Hikaru shook his head. ""This is the only road that we need to cross and it""s the safest route anyways. Right Haruka?"" Haruka nodded. ""Yes, just be quiet. I think I hear something else."" Hikaru glanced behind them, making sure no one was sneaking up from behind. The sun was gleaming in the horizon from where it was rising, casting a bright twinkling light they had stayed in the night before. They were lucky; really, to have found a house that hadn""t been looted and still had clean beds and a stock of food. There hadn""t even been any bodies lying around! That was always a plus. Kneeling down, Hikaru pulled up the right leg of his jeans, revealing the knife wedged into his sock. He couldn""t help checking to make sure it was still there.

Confused, but figuring she would just roll with it, Katniss stood up and twirled around. The audience and Caesar gasped. Cinna did as well. As Katniss twirled, everyone could make out letters that spelled ""BOOZE FOREVER"". ""I didn""t do that."" Cinna said flatly. ""THEY WILL NOT TAKE OUR ALCOHOL AWAY FROM US!"" screeched Haymitch.

""Attention whore,"" Johanna and Finnick both muttered as they glared at Katniss. ""You ruined my dress!"" Cinna screamed at Haymitch, as he ran up to him and punched him in the face.

His daughter said something about it bringing the lighter green flecks of his eyes out and that the sparkles were to make him look glamorous or glam-ous, if he quoted Tracey correctly. He almost said no to her fingernail painting idea when he discovered Trevor was coming over, but his daughter had given him her famous puppy-dog eyed look and he caved in.

Hedwig lightly hooted, Pig zoomed around in his cage, and Crookshanks lightly purred in his basket. ""Harry Potter!"" A squeaky voice sighed to him as a puff of smoke suddenly appeared on his trolley. ""Sssh!!"" Harry hissed to Dobby the House Elf. ""Shut up! And get down!""

Draco and his servant pushed past the four and on to the gateway to Platform 93⁄4. A moment later and Draco was joined by Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. Draco wasted no time in detaching himself from the pesky group, disappearing without another word to them towards the luggage area, his servant following. ""Well that was weird.""

It just felt like it was lived in. After reaching the bed, the two of them took a few minutes to situate. In the end, they slept side-by-side, not touching each other, but close enough to feel each other""s body heat. It was silent as Eren watched Levi for a while, seemingly transfixed by him. Feeling the stare, Levi turned onto his side so that he faced the wall, and soon fell asleep. It took Eren much longer to doze off, but when he did, he was staring at the ceiling, watching as the fan spun in circles. When visitors or relatives came over, Eren took to hiding behind Levi every time, without fail. His little hands gripped the back of Levi""s shirt tightly as he peeked around him to take in the newcomers. The adults had gone to talking as usual, right after introducing everyone, so now was the time when the kids started their own awkward little conversation. A girl about Eren""s age stood in front of them now. She was supposedly Levi""s cousin, and it was easy to see the resemblance. They both had that dark, raven-colored hair and piercing, gray eyes. They even had the same slim build and sharp yet elegant bone structure in their faces. But most of all, they each had a signature glare that would have made the best of men shudder. The girl looked at the two boys for a second, looking from her slightly taller cousin to the boy hiding behind him.

His infatuation to their young queen was still there, but he had been content to let it slip to the background untouched. He had a life he always wanted. He had a best friend who understood him without any need for word. He had his magnificent Solff, the prince of the sky and the dream of every sky pirate. So why Penelo...? Vaan sighed and returned to his seat. That was really childish, his trying to blame others. Penelo had every right to feel anything she wanted to feel about him. And yes, he was very fond of her, but there was something else, something that held his tongue from saying ""yes"" to her confession. And now he had to make sure if that something was not, in fact, someone who happened to be the Queen of Dalmasca. The sound of approaching footsteps shook him out of his thoughts. Vaan looked up to the door just in time as it flew open and admitted the very person who had lingered in the back of his mind since many nights ago. Her eyes found him after a moment and she exclaimed in surprise. ""Vaan!"" What he didn""t expect was for two men to come rushing into the chamber after this exclamation and point their swords at him. He got onto his feet at once and belatedly realized that he had left his Durandel with Penelo, thinking that to bring a sword would only get in his way. All that he had with him now was a small platinum dagger, her gift for his birthday last year. He pulled it out on instinct and crossed it defensively in front of his chest, at the same time as the queen spoke again. ""Wait,

""Do you really want to do this?"" Despite the oppressive feeling in his chest, Kyouya found himself giving the twin an indifferent look. ""Are you two threatening me?"" ""Who knows?"" they replied in perfect synch and the way they looked so much like the other was, for once, utterly disturbing to him. ""We can make someone""s life very miserable, you know. If we really want to."" Kyouya had no doubt of it, but his attention was currently drawn to a small sound coming from the door which he had left slightly ajar. The twin turned around and they found Tamaki standing before the door, a stern look on his face. It felt like the temperature had dropped for several degrees and Kyouya knew it had nothing to do with the deepening night. He couldn""t see the twin""s expression but knew that their alarm was no less than his because Tamaki for once looked like the king he had always proclaimed himself to be. He took a step forward, the sound echoing in the cool, silent night air. Kyouya discovered that it was getting harder to breathe properly, sensing the impending doom. ""That wasn""t nice,"" Tamaki finally said, displeasure ringing in his voice. Another round of silence followed and no one moved as if afraid to break the spell, as if Tamaki""s presence brought everything but the wind to a standstill.

No need to worry about anything spoiling tonight! Just in case it got cold enough to freeze the pipes, she left the sink taps trickling. In the living room she could hear as Mulder stirred the fire and added new splits. The new wood crackled and hissed as it caught, then settled down to burn steadily, scenting the air with apple-wood smoke. She heard the door and realized Mulder was making another trip to the garage. She decided to venture back into her frigid bathroom, making it as quick a trip as possible because of the cold. She left the water running there, too, as she left with her candle. A faint glow and the sound of running water came from the guest bath.

Text2: As one of the largest districts in Panem, District 11 has to face the unfortunate necessity of going through two selection processes. In a small, cramped, stuffy office in the epicentre of the vast region, an anonymous, impartial participant reaches a gloved hand into two separate sheer, shiny wooden boxes that contain thousands upon thousands of names. Six hundred are selected: three hundred boys and girls each. In the end, the rolls of parchment go out all across the district: to the low-lying villages, the market towns, the vale communities, the isolated orchard clans. They summon the child and a parent or guardian to attend the Reaping. Every spring, families curl up and whisper silent prayers to their earth gods that watch over the harvest and the plants and the soil that produces their bounty to spare their children. They pray that there is no knock on the door by the men or women in white uniform who carry a damning scroll. There is a desperate hope nobody will come for their young who just want to bathe in the pools and listen to their grandparent""s stories at night. But by the time the Fifteenth Annual Hunger Games rolls around with the weight of three hundred and twenty two dead children under its name, the hope has subsided and all that can be felt is fear - palpable, undeniable fear. The Peacekeepers are dispatched a month prior to the Reaping for the Fifteenth and they go to the Malou household, a cabin far too small for its nine inhabitants.

On the third night, The children of the waltz cause ripples on the face of the world!"" He noticed in the distance a brown streak of a town. Never had he been so happy to see any sort of civilization. He had walked iles and iles to get this far, and he was finally there. Well, almost. Taking care not to hurt him more than he had to, he gently laid his brother on the sandy ground before joining him. Time for one last rest before the final push. He looked at his twin lying there so peacefully beside him, his chest going in and out. He looked human. Peaceful. One would never know to look at him that he had nearly brought about the end of humanity countless times.... Sometimes he wondered why he went through so much trouble to spare his sibling. He looked towards the town in the distance. How he hoped there were at least two someone""s there who cared very much about him. The petite girl with short, raven hair sat on the porch swing. She was thankful that the wind had died down. No sand blew in her face now, but she wished that there was a least a slight breeze. She""d completely taken off her derringer cloak, and wore her half-sleeved undershirt. Gone were her leggings, over-shirt, and boots. The heat was beginning to get to her now.

She felt wonderful, which was an extremely strange sensation, as in normal circumstances Clove would have a knife to the throat of anyone who woke her from her sleep, in less than a second. Even if that was her father, or her sister, or even her mother. No, she thought bitterly. Especially if it was her. She had never recovered her relationship with her mother since that day, since that dark and gruesome day. And she vowed that she never would. Never could and never should. Instead of the usual scowl that was on her face in the morning, Clove got up with a somewhat amused expression as she headed for the shower.

When he left her, he left himself and he knew that. He could see everything more clearly to study and analyze the situation. He kept walking. After countless minutes, maybe an hour, two hours, three hours, he came to a conclusion. It was his fault. Self-inflicting rage burned within him.

""Your mother,"" Scully""s lip quivered slightly, ""she""s dead."" Scully drove Mulder over to his mother""s at his instance. He would not have no for an answer. He wanted to see her home. He opened the door, past the police, as Scully flashed her badge for the police. They had barely been on the scene an hour. Scully followed Mulder in to see the oven door wide open, the investigators standing about it. She watched Mulder talk to the team. He looked baffled. Why would his mother go and kill herself? The coroner handed Mulder a bottle of medication that was empty as Scully looked around, still standing back. She noticed things taped down and sealed. She watched Mulder walk off down the hallway and went to follow. She found him in his mother""s room. ""Mulder?"" She called out softly into the bedroom.

Kaoru made his way silently over to his seat and sat on the desk to catch his breath. I wonder where Hikaru is hiding. I wish we could have finished our prank. It would have been fun. The goal of the prank was to make the seeker be forced to look through all the rooms since they were tampered with to make it look like someone had gone in there, so that they could make sure that there was no one hiding anywhere. Then they were going to purposely throw a rock or something into the rooms to make a sound and to make the person who was ""it"" go back to reexamine the room. Then when they got bored they were going to go into one of the rooms already checked and hide in separate spots so that they couldn""t be accused of hiding together. The plan was foolproof! Kaoru sighed. I hope Hikaru hasn""t gotten caught yet. Suddenly, the handle to the door could be heard turning and Kaoru jumped. I need to hide! He wasn""t sure if the others had been found yet, but just in case he definitely did NOT want to lose this game and be one of the first people found! Looking around the room, Kaoru found the teacher""s cabinet where he stored his coats and other things he wore to school. He ran over to the wall and opened it up, relieved to see that it was empty AND just the right size to fit him AND Hikaru into it, which meant that it was pretty big, Almost like a small closet. Silently, Kaoru slipped in and closed

The teen looked up at the bright sky. ""What time is it?"" he asked, hating the fact that he didn""t have a watch. ""That depends on where you are,"" Flower Tsubaki replied. Hisoka sighed. Why was everyone here so difficult when it came to questions? ""Okay, well... bye."" The emerald eyed teen said, for some reason finding the word hard to get out. He felt as if he was losing a friend that he already lost before, and it gave him a sickening feeling. ""I hope we meet again, Hisoka-kun, in a different dream,"" he heard her reply. He wanted to turn around and ask her what she meant, but he couldn""t bring himself to do it. He walked away, fighting the depression that was threatening to take over him for reasons unknown. Hisoka continued walking through the grass for about an hour. He hadn""t stopped walking since he left Flower Tsubaki, and his legs were getting awfully sore. He ignored the pain. All of a sudden, a strange smell wafted towards Hisoka. Curious, he looked up to see a trail of smoke coming from the grass. Following it, the teen ran through the bladed plant and stumbled into a clearing in front of a giant mushroom. Slowly, Hisoka looked up to see a man wearing a Yukata smoking what appeared to be a hookah. The man had long, dark hair and dark eyes, wore a fox-like mask on the side of his head, and where the yukata ended the tip of a green plump caterpillar body showed.

He also had a great point, chances are I would die any way, but by going into the games I had a chance to give my family all they wanted and more. ""I volunteer.""

""Well nice to meet you John Watson. Now if you""ll excuse me, I have some investigating to do."" And then he turned and walked down the path, further into the woods. John stared disbelievingly at the retreating figure. Did that just happen? Did that strange boy really just take his toy gun? It took only a few seconds before he was running after Sherlock, little feet pounding angrily. ""Sherlock! Give it back!"" ""If you""re coming be quiet!"" Sherlock hissed over his shoulder as he took an abrupt turn to the left, leaping over the intertwined tree trunks. ""Where are you going with my gun?""John followed, breathing hard. ""To catch a baddie of course!"" ""Baddie?!"" ""Bad guy, evil doer, villain, criminal. Need I say more?"" Sherlock stopped and crouched down behind some shrubs, his voice a whisper. Even though he ran all the way, he hardly broke a sweat, the only giveaway being his labored breathing. ""Get down John!"" He hissed. Almost immediately John dropped to the grass, his toy gun still clutched in his hands as he tried to regain his breath. Stealthily, Sherlock peered around the shrubs, his eyes darting around. ""Just as I thought."" He mumbled to himself and slid back beside John. Without saying anything Sherlock pulled his mobile phone out of his jacket pocket and quickly texted someone before motioning for them to leave the way they came.

In the still of the evening, with the sunset intruding I lay under him with my bare skin touching the warm sand, soft music playing behind us, from his car setting up the mood under the moon. I submitted to his embrace, as the stars came out to play in this endless night. He had undressed me holding me down against the sun, while he came towards me to caress me. I moaned digging my face into his neck, and the smell of his alluring fragrance started to drive me crazy and I felt as though I was in a pit of fire with Satan to accompany me. He nibbled my ear allowing me open my mouth against his neck, making me taste the sweetness of his skin. My body came alive in the heat but felt numb.

They would have bid each other goodnight when they arrived at their respective rooms, slipping in and closing the door quickly, as if afraid that were the door left open too long, temptation would sneak in. Tonight, temptation had the upper hand and was waiting for them. Scully""s room was the closest. Mulder, lost in thought, nearly crashed straight into her when she stopped to slide her keycard in. To keep himself steady, he leaned against the door jam with one hand while the other hid in his pocket, jingling the car keys nervously. The musical tinkle of keys was the only sound audible in the hall, but Mulder was sure had anyone walked by they would have been able to hear his heart pounding too. With a click, the little light on the keycard slot flashed from red to green and the door unlocked. Mulder almost chuckled aloud at the irony. The door was an enabler, changing to green, giving them the ""go ahead"" to engage in activities they both wanted and feared at the same time. Had the light remained red, the night could potentially have turned out much different. Scully hesitated as she pushed down the handle, opening the door just a crack before stopping. Her intake of breath was sharp as she turned slowly to look at Mulder. ""Want to come in?"" The words flew out of her mouth easier than she knew they should have. Now it was Mulder""s turn to hesitate. He looked deep into her eyes, searching intently for a sign, any sign, of uncertainty. If he found any, he had a way out.

He locked eyes with everyone gathered around the cold steel surgical table to show how gravely serious he was. He had their attention.

""Well, like the Druids, every young werewolf has a choice; to grow into something so much bigger than themselves, rising up to protect the pack. Those are the Alphas.

Either join the squids and fight against his own friends or let them suffer a terrible fate. There was no doubt in his mind that the King would make him watch them die.

Usually, it would annoy him, but he felt she wasn""t making fun of him, simply his words. In all honesty, he would make fun of his words, too.

Azure eyes locked on the hideous monster looming over her, hatred flaring in their bluish depths. The youma was a huge eagle, roughly twenty times the size of one found on Earth. Its beak was stained with blood from battles past, and its hooked talons on each foot were tense, ready to dig into fresh meat. I won""t let you take me down, thought Sawn. I won""t. She stood shakily, blood streaking from the many cuts about her body and from the main gash in her left shoulder, where a talon had gotten the best of her. One of her wings was broken, now useless to her in the battle. Maybe if she had been more alert, maybe if she had sensed the attack coming, she could have prevented her injuries. Sawn clenched her main wound in an attempt to stifle the blood flow, feeling like a fool. If only she hadn""t stumbled into the monster""s territory unknowingly, she wouldn""t be in such a predicament! Suddenly, she saw a flash of movement before her.

""Yep!,"" Dawn said, looking over her shoulder at the forest, ""But we should gear up quickly. It""s a quite while away."" ""Well, let""s go then!"" Gecko shouted over her shoulder, already sprinting towards her house, ""Race ya!"" ""You""re on!"" Dawn shouted back as she raced off after her friend. Soon the duo was on their way to Red""s place, with Dawn leading the way. They had both grabbed a full set of iron armor, a set of iron tools, and food that would last them quite a while. As they travelled through the forest, they stayed silent, only a word spoken here or there. Dawn was deep in thought, thinking about how she would rebuild her home, and Gecko was trying to memorize the land, just in case she needed to traverse it again some time. Dawn wasn""t paying much attention to the ground in front of her, only looking up now and again to make sure they were on the right track. All of a sudden, Gecko heard a panicked scream ahead and looked up quickly to see a hand disappearing over a cliff. ""Dawn!"" Gecko shouted, racing to the side of the sheer drop. She stared downwards, worried about her friend, when she saw Dawn bobbing up

Text2: The next thing I know, my body is pressed against the wall. I can feel every inch of Peeta""s body on mine which only causes my desire to grow. One of my hands digs into the hair at the back of his neck. The other rests nearby on his shoulder. Meanwhile, Peeta""s hand trails its way down the side of my body. It eventually finds the bottom edge of my dress, sneaking underneath and back up my thigh. My breathing is rapid to match his. ""Is this ok?"" He asks, pulling back suddenly before pressing his lips to mine. I manage to nod my approval. After, I feel his fingertips trailing the top edge of my panties. His other hand finds its way to my backside. I begin to unbutton his shirt, clenching a fistful of the fabric as I feel his fingertips slide past the waistband of my underwear and down into my folds. I gasp as his fingers find my clit. I hear his breathing in my ear as I gather my wits and continue unbuttoning his shirt. It proves to be rather difficult given my drunken state and the newfound pleasure seeping into my body. I push the fabric from his shoulders, revealing his toned upper body. He pulls his hand from my underwear to allow me to fully remove his shirt. As it falls to the floor, I look down to make it my next mission to remove his belt and pants. With my attention diverted, Peeta lifts my face to his with both hands. His tongue flicks my lips, encouraging our kiss to go deeper. Although temporarily distracted, I am much more efficient at removing the lower half of his clothing. I quickly discover the effect I""ve had on him. It is my turn to","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Sano said, ""Besides, most girls don""t like ill-tempered guys."" Robert sighed as he scrolled over his profile. The website Anon had become very popular with the kids at school. It was a website that people used to talk to anonymous strangers or whatever. It sounded totally bogus, but all his classmates had profiles on it. It was kind of like Omegle, except with profiles and screen names. Sano had given Robert the most weirdest(in Robert""s part) screen name ever made: IdealsIntoReality. ""Why the hell..."" Robert glared at his friend, who gave a sheepish smile in return. ""I thought it suited you,"" Sano said in defense, ""Just like mine suits me."" ""What""s yours?"" ""Iron-ide."" ""That literally makes no sense."" ""It""s because I""m made of iron. If you know what I""m saying."" Robert""s eye twitched menacingly. He swiveled around again to face the monitor. There was a doubt in Robert""s mind that he would get any messages. ""Dude, add me as a friend,"" Sano said. ""Get out,"" Robert replied. Sano was about to protest when Robert swerved around and gave him a sadistic smile that promised pain if he stayed. Sano put his hands up and said, ""Alright. I""m out. Call me later?"" ""Call you later,"" Robert said, feeling like a girl for having to say it. After Sano left, Robert was left to stare at his anonymous profile. He sighed and shut down his computer. No one would even message him anyway, right? ... His alarm clock was so annoying as its ring boomed throughout the room. Robert groaned as he reached over to slam the clock across the wall. The smash woke him up fully as he jumped up

Kyoya looked at Ashleigh, suspiciously. Ashleigh was panicking inside. ""What should I do? What should I say?' she mentally screamed. ""She""s with me."" a voice came from across the room. Everyone turned to see a girl almost six feet tall with short and straight brown hair with curled tips. She was wearing the same uniform that Ashleigh had on. The girl also had on contact lens. ""Oh."", Tamaki stood up from his ""Emo Corner"" and looked at the girl. ""Kasi?' Ashleigh thought. Kasi smiled at everybody but she gave Ashleigh a icy glare. Ashleigh gulped in surprise. ""Come on, Ashleigh. There""s still lots to show you around Ouran."" Kasi said as she walked out. ""We could always show her around."", Hikaru came up and put his arm on Ashleigh""s shoulder. Ashleigh blushed. ""No, no. It""s quite alright."", Kasi said, ""I need to speak with her in private anyways."". Hikaru backed off and Ashleigh followed Kasi out onto the courtyard. Kasi turned around to face Ashleigh. ""Alright. Explain."". ""Explain what?"", Ashleigh""s eyes wandered around. ""Explain why you are here!"", Kasi growled. ""Hey! The spell was in your book! How was I suppose to know not to read it?"", Ashleigh yelled. Kasi shook her head. She turned around and started to walk away. ""Hey. Hey! Where are you going?"" Ashleigh yelled as she ran after Kasi. ""How am I suppose to get out of here?"". Kasi spun on her heels and was face-to-face with Ashleigh. ""That, my friend, you need to figure out on your own."".

""Amber LeAnn Marx, will you marry me Thomas Joel Keen?"" I pull out the ring that was hiding in my coat pocket and take her left hand while waiting for her reply. Tears are flowing from her face as she has her head looking down at her pants. She looks up at me in fear. ""Tom,. . .I can""t"" Watching her cry, my heart sinks to the bottom of my chest. I feel crushed. Emotions flare throughout my body, along with a string of cuss words and questions mixed together, confusion and agony attack me all at once. ""Why?"" I asked, ""Why can""t you marry me?"" The pain is overwhelming and I try to calm myself. Wiping the tears from her cheek, she settles herself before speaking. ""I was afraid of telling anyone this."" She pauses for a moment then continues, ""Remember when I told you about my boyfriend during high school, David, and how we were in love?"" I nod my head and anger begins to swell in me as I remember the horrid stories she told me of what he made her do. The witchcraft he was into that he made her participate in. I say nothing and allow her to continue. ""One night shortly after high school, we got trashed and went to a place back in Magic Lake.

Ever since Melissa was killed, she""d had been leaving the light on. Not that it would make much difference if they really want to kill me, she thought. She flipped the lamp on beside the telephone, the answering machine flashed red insistently, messages waiting for her attention. She kicked off her shoes, stumbled into the kitchen, and poured herself a shot of scotch. After today, I need music and scotch. Much more scotch, she thought. She made her way over to the stereo, and picked up a large bundle of mail that had accumulated over the last week.Trash, trash, and more trash, why can""t I get meaningful mail? You have to give to receive, her mind added.""Shut up!"" She snapped, then giggled at her outburst. Who am I talking to? She poured another shot into her glass, and drifted into her bedroom. The sounds of Stan Getz filtered through the air, and she quickly changed into sweat pants, and her F.B.I. academy sweatshirt. She put together a load of laundry, gathered her detergent, and fabric softener, and headed towards the basement. Dana looked to the left and right of her, there was no one in the laundry. Thank God, she thought. If I had to make small talk with any of these losers right now I would surely die. She pushed the coin slot in, and heard the water start.

She had a few changes of panties and bras, for days when she really didn""t feel like sneaking back home. Text books for a school she hardly went to. A hello kitty diary. Her cell phone. One make up bag, including a toothbrush, mini hair brush, tampons , pain killers, and her left over birth control. A game boy color. Napkins. A carton of cigarettes. Matches. A green iPod nano with a sticker of a Bulbasaur on the back, secured with tape so it wouldn""t fade. A camera, and various photos floating around the bag, along with rolls of used and unused film. The latest issue of Shojo Beat (She just couldn""t get enough of the romance and drama it supplied her with). A can of mace, just in case. Ray ban sunglasses. A box of Mario Band-Aids.

A pouch of pencils, pens and markers. A key ring with ten different key chains and two keys, one for her house and one for her ex boyfriends. Thinking about him made her stomach go up to her throat.

She was about to ask why, but the look on his face told her not to. ""My great great great grandfather was a student of your ancestor!"" Tokage proclaimed. ""Ha ha...Great."" Hunny said uneasily. Haruhi felt a little guilty for putting him in this situation. Especially when the Yankee dropped to the ground and bowed deeply at Hunny, who looked baffled and a slight bit embarrassed. ""Sensei!"" The Yankee said respectively. Looking up at Nemui for help, Haruhi frowned when she saw that he was looking at something on his cell phone. She frowned. ""um, aren""t you going to do something? She""s...On the ground..."" And she was causing another scene. He took his lazy eyes off the screen and shook his head. ""Can""t mess with her when she""s this serious. I don""t wanna die young.""

Haruhi wondered if they where ever going to that stupid banquet. ""Um...I don""t know...I don;t really teach anymore."" Hunny said. ""Just say yes.

Sherlock opened one eye and stared at John in panic. This wasn""t supposed to happen. Without thinking John drew his toy gun, still loaded with toy bullets and fired at the man""s face. It did nothing but irritate him further; he squeezed Sherlock tighter, cutting off his air supply as he stumbled towards John, intending to grab him as well. Panicking, John threw his gun at the man""s eye. It hit spot on, forcing him to shout and drop Sherlock and cover his eye, when he pulled his hands away they were soaked in tears.

I""ve attempted to avoid the OOC but doing this sort of storyline for Ouran makes it hard going! Also this is more anime based than manga if only because I like the sillier edge the anime has! I own only the plot, which is a shame because I could do so very much with Haruhi. For a year she""d been a reluctant member of the Host Club, the debt that tied her to the association and those that worked within it, growing and shrinking at the whim of the club""s ""shadow king"". Then two of the six members of the club had graduation and suddenly everything had begun to change. It had been a gradual thing which had started with the speech that Tamaki had made at Honey""s graduation party, that had led to her being swept into the oddest of plans and that would end in another change. Whether that final change would be one for the positive was something she was just going to have to find out. The party that had started the whole affair had been made a mandatory thing by Kouya and thus, aware that she could be better spending her time elsewhere; she""d spent the first hour in the worst of moods. Honey had eventually worked her out of this ""frump"" with a cute little pout and the childish enquiry of, ""Aren""t you going to miss me, Haru-chan?""

She traced a hand over one of many pentagrams scribbled with charcoal on her apartment""s walls, feeling a sense of relief. Relax, Kurayami. Your room is completely free of the supernatural. You couldn""t be safer. Besides the pentagrams, at least twenty dream catchers hung from the ceiling, many directly above her bed. Garlic draped over large, makeshift wooden crosses decorated the mantel above the fireplace, a horseshoe was suspended from a nail above her front door, and the carcass of a black cat sat atop her nightstand, a disturbing reminder to any felines of a certain color to stay away from her. Far, far away. She wondered why people always seemed a bit frightened of her whenever she invited them up to her apartment. Sipping her green tea idly, Kurayami""s nervous green eyes darted about her two-room home. The hairs on the back of her neck were standing up. Was something watching her? Or was it just a warning of something bad to come...? She shrieked and spilled a bit of her tea on her lap when there came a harsh knocking upon her front door. She squeaked. Who could possibly be here at this hour?! ""W-Who is it?"" She called, trying not to sound as afraid as she was feeling. The person on the other side responded almost instantly. ""Kura, it""s me. Masao."" Kurayami Kirishima blanched. ""Onii-chan? I thought you were--"" ""I was. They... let me go free. Now, let me inside, I""m freezing!"" ""H-Hai!""

With all of her layers he couldn""t easily discern her injuries and moving her would just make matters worse. One trembling hand reaching for the cell phone in his pocket and the other gently brushing wet hair from her face, he whispered, ""Haruhi? Please, God, answer me."" Slowly, those beautiful brown eyes opened. Though they were glazed over with pain, her eyes met his. She made a croaking noise, voice failing her. Terror seized Mori""s heart when he saw the blood staining her teeth. ""Don""t try to talk. Don""t try to move. Just stay awake and with me, okay?"" He pulled his phone from his pocket only to see it had been ruined in the fall. Cracks spidered across the screen and the frame had been shattered to bits. ""Fuck!"" Mori hurled the useless device into the road and clambered to his feet, looking for anyone who could help. His shouts fell on deaf ears; no one else had been foolhardy enough to brave the weather. The driver and his/her offending vehicle were long gone. Desperate, he ran gloved hands through his hair, willing himself to think through the panic. He was going to need to go for help, which would require leaving Haruhi alone, helpless, in the snow. Though he understood the necessity, the very thought of what he had to do tore at his heart. Draping his coat over her small form, Mori took off back towards the school building. It felt odd to be lying on her back in the snow without making a snow angel.

Jack replied with an awkward face. ""I just told you he was there five seconds ago."" ""Well, sor-ry."" Tom replied. The trio dropped down from the safe zone of the Ender Zone into the fighting arena. When they looked around, many types of sceneries were there. The fighting of 1v1""s, the bows of rivals, the arrows of a soon coming death, even the recording of MeTube videos. The player recording the video to MeTube had a camera strapped to his eyes. The goggle camera looked like night vision goggles. Tom saw Kevin1727, killing off a player with a blue jacket. Kevin had killed the player with a Bow of Lothlerien. ""Oops, I missed."" Kevin said with a grin. The trio arrived at the tower. ""Okay we""re here."" Jack said as he slowly tiptoed away from the two players.

Before he could reach to grasp her hand, Caspian was interrupted by the beaten and battered forest army that had been recruited, and depleted in a matter of days. Leading the way across the field was the kings and queens of old; High King Peter, King Edmond, Queens Lucy and Susan. When the rest of the soldiers had bowed before the supposed saviors of Narnia, Lyana looked up skeptically. King Peter appeared most confused by the action. ""Are you not from Narnia?"" He asked her curiously. ""I am very young, in regards to native Narnians, but I do not see why I must bow to you. My duty is to protect the forest, and you have destroyed its keepers,"" she indicated the exhausted attack force before them. Peter was taken aback by the statement. No one before the catacomb had even noticed that the young girl was there until she spoke out. When she did though, there was a sweeping admiration among the warriors.

There was no reason to go to any other towns, because all their friends and families were right there. After the Gold Rush, every resident of Carmel was taken out of their comfort zone as tourists and newcomers flocked to the picturesque town.

But then again, you probably aren""t even reading this. Moral of the story, hate will go right over my head, so go ahead and write it if you want. But I do have one question, if this mysterious Guest is reading this. If you tell me that this story - which is as close to canon as I can get it - needs to die

Gilbert opens his mouth to ask why he would do that, but she turns to look him in the eye and his words die in his throat. Her brilliant violet eyes shine unnaturally bright under the stark hospital lighting, and Gilbert can""t contain himself as he leans forward and presses a quick kiss on her lips. ""Of course that""s what he did. He wants you to be alone with the awesome me!"" He bluffs, making her laugh. ""You""re so self-absorbed, it""s kinda cute. Your hair and eyes are too, they""re pretty awesome,"" Madeline states, causing the albino boy to beam at the use of ""his word"". After a few moments, her eyes move, looking his entire face up and down. ""Say, Gil?"" Her tone changes, becoming even more quiet and docile than he had thought possible, and he raises an eyebrow with a reassuring smile. ""Yeah, Birdie?"" The childish nickname makes her smile a bit wider, but it almost immediately fades. She shifts her gaze to the window opposite his bed, her eyes following the gentle waving of a flag flying on the opposite building. ""Have you ever thought about... I mean, you probably have, but... What do you think..."" She whispers, Gilbert""s ears straining to catch her words. ""What do you think... you""ll do? I mean, after you get... better..."" The boy stays silent for a moment, thinking of the best way to answer the question. The pause lasts longer than he had meant for it to, and she turns back to him to smile softly.

Just as I was pondering what my emotions on my sister""s problematic relationship were, I heard a loud crash. I quickly turned my head to see what the commotion was. The ghost was laughing harder than I have seen most humans laugh at the boy who he had no doubt tripped. The boy, who I recognized from my biology class, was lying on the floor clearly embarrassed to have his food spilled all around him. The boy""s name, if I recall correctly, was Trevor. Trevor had a brown buzz cut and was on the thinner side. He wore glasses to read, but contacts everywhere else. He wasn""t a jock, but not a nerd. He was more like the kind of guy who goes out for the theater. He stood and tried to shake it off with a smile. The ghost disappeared before I could say a word. The lunch bell rang and I walked swiftly to throw my trash in one of the many green trash cans that cluttered the cafeteria almost as much as the posters. I walked to my next class in a daze; there were so many thoughts in my head that I found it hard to concentrate on what classes I had in the afternoon. My mind was filled and also boggled with this ghost. He seemed to be with Elle always and I had no idea why. He also didn""t seem like he was even from the past 100 years. And what was with the black haired kid that was hurting Trevor in the lunchroom? That was extremely odd. This

All three of us were striking various positions, not really completely serious. It just wasn""t us. One picture caught my eye and I had to laugh at the silliness of it. Dad was wearing an Hawaiian shirt, after spilling some drink on the grey muscle shirt. ""Only you would wear a Hawaiian shirt in Japan."" he pouted but momma and Jackie chuckled. ""I think your father looks good in anything he wears."" momma swooped down to kiss her husband on the tip of his nose. I would have wrinkled my nose but the light blush on his cheeks made me smile instead. Married twenty years and momma still makes him blush. God damn that""s sweet. Then I actually looked at the picture, a smile touching my lips. I fell in love with a picture, people. ""This one."" I looked at Jackie, pointing to the very same one with dad and his flower print shirt. ""Thought you""d like that one."" a gentle smile touched his face. ""Which one?"" momma and dad slid forward to look, their eyes softening. Momma and dad stood side by side, grinning evilly. I was in their arms, stretched out the length of them.

No, Hiro was feeling anxious, and for once it wasn""t about all the cash he was going to make bot fighting. He was going to go to a college drag race where everyone got to show off their cars. If it was anything like how he expected (well, hoped) then it would be his fondest memory. Hiro stared at the ceiling as he lay sprawled on his back. Now that he was sixteen, he technically could drive in the race if he was able to get his hands on a car. Tadashi didn""t own a car (he took the trolley) but he still participated in the racing part, so he must get a car from someone. Maybe if he were lucky, Hiro could barrow one too. With the cheery thought on his mind, he jerked back his covers. After snooping around for a clean pair of pants and a hoody, he locked himself in the bathroom for a quick shower. The remainder of the day dragged by remarkably slow. He spent the majority of his spare time on his computer, drawing up designs and upgrades that he could install for his microbot fighter. He wasn""t a bragger, but he wasn""t going to lose his reputation as the best bot fighter in downtown San Fransokyo because he didn""t upgrade something.

Text2: The sun was high in the sky, casting shadows across the deck of the Bounty from nearby trees, by which the ship was anchored. The day was warm, but not unpleasant. The cool breezes that shifted the clouds and shook the leaves on the trees churned the air, keeping the temperature comfortable enough to be outside. Even without a watch, Nya could tell by the way the sun rested in the sky above her that it was only a few hours into the evening. Perhaps four thirty or five o""clock, but certainly not any later. The guys would be back any time now, hopefully with the second Fang Blade. Zane, Jay, Kia, and Cole had set out for Cole""s father""s home nearly five days earlier, plotting to steal the Blade Cup in order to put a halt to Pythor""s schemes. Zane had kept in touch with her through the falcon, having the mechanical bird bring her a crumpled note saying that they would be staying longer than expected in an attempt to enter the contest in order to get closer to the Fang Blade before making the grab. Because the talent show had been the night before, Nya had no reason to suspect that they would be gone longer. It was either they had the Fang Blade or they didn""t, though she was desperately wishing that it wasn""t the latter. A cool breeze blew past, rustling through Nya""s short black hair. The wind felt refreshing against her warm, perspiring skin. She had spent the first half of her week productively, utilizing her free space for training with her samurai equipment.

He jumped off the couch and did a few laps up and down the hall, tail wagging excessively as he dropped his nose to the floor. He wasn""t really searching for any particular smell.

I ran out of the house and across the field, desperate to escape the smell of death, and the sound of pain. I came to the fence, and almost fell over it, just breathing heavily. Damp, approaching, footsteps suddenly caught my attention, and as I looked into the woods, I heard a deep rough moan. Suddenly an image came into mind. I was standing in the middle of the field, surrounded by group of 20, maybe 30, corpse creatures. My sword was broken and I had no other weapon. They creatures kept getting closer, and suddenly the short green creature was behind me, and suddenly all I could see was flames. I shook my head, getting the scene out my head. Hell I would die tonight! I ran back to the house and the field. I rushed into the house and looked after anything pointy. I ended up finding a stash of several quivers of arrows, but only a bow that was snapped in two. With a belt I found, I strapped the sword to my back. I also grapped a 12 m (37 ft.) rope from the first floor. I got up on the second floor of the house. Though part of the wall was missing, and the stairs was lesser broken too.

But the cult-"" She pointed to a smaller structure up towards the top of the map. ""-that""s the cult. They don""t like visitors, and are very protective. The only way we could make it into the temple safely is to get safe passage from them."" I leaned over her shoulder to get a better look. ""You said they don""t like visitors. How are we going to get into the temple safely? I""m assuming they won""t help us."" Emfia stated. ""They accept new members every 8 years. As luckily for us, this is the 8th year."" Jess smiled at me. I was worried. Although this cult would be accepting new members, I know the process to get in. Back when I really was Herobrine, I would come to visit the cult every once in a while. They honored me to no end, but their leader, Omega, was a shifty guy. One of the members warned me that Omega wanted to take my place one day. And that he would do anything to get there. At the time, I only laughed. I was an immortal! A mortal trying to take my place was ridiculous, but since ""Herobrine"" isn""t really around... ""The cult is called TCOH. We have to be there by tomorrow. That""s when the incitation starts."" Jess said, snapping me out of my thoughts. ""They go to the temple every day to venerate. So once we get inside, we""ll hide in

He stopped and faced at the guy, ""How did he know rITA""s name?"" He had question marks all over his head.The violet haired girl turned, looking surprised. They stared at each for a minute and saw the others behind him. She laughed, ""I am impressed!"" Before the long and short browned haired girls jumped over to her, Mitsui screamed.""Do you still love me?"" He had a blushed, didn""t have a second thought to ask. She looked down and she did have a blush too. She looked at the basketball on the ground and smiled widely. She looked up at him with a sweet smile and replied, ""I love basketball!"" The violet haired girl looked through the window leaning her right temple on her right palm. She was day dreaming since it was self-study. She turned when she heard footsteps. ""Hey Rita,"" She looked at the long tied up black haired lady leaning on her desk, ""Did you hear? There are 5 transferred students."" Rita had irritated eyes and turned to the window, ""Not interested. Wenna, I told you, I don""t care anything anymore.""

He looked around for the woman he loved, but couldn""t find her. Then he remembered where he last saw her. He began to worry, and turned to Edmund. ""I""m going to find Max!"" He said, Edmund nodded. ""I""ll come with you."" He said, following his friend to the dungeons. As they came closer to the cell they were held in, they heard cries of pain. Caspian""s blood ran cold when he realized it was Maxine. He ran a little faster and he burst through the dungeon door. His blood went from ice cold in fear to boiling hot in anger when he saw the two slave traders, one of them holding a whip, and Maxine on her knees facing a pillar of wood, with her hands bound to it. He saw red and drew his sword, letting out a wild cry and attacking the two of them. Once they were both incapacitated, he went over to Maxine, his heart clenching painfully in his chest at the sight of her exposed back. There were scars all over it, and she was bleeding profusely. He came over to her, releasing her wrists from the ropes and putting his arm around her, careful of her back. She looked up at him, and saw her cheeks, eyes, and nose were red from crying. He gently put his hand on her cheek, tucking some of her hair behind her ear with the utmost care. ""Caspian..."" Caspian felt his heart breaking at the sound of her weakened voice. She grasped his shirt and leaned into him. He took her in his arms, his arms barely

The twins asked incredulously, gaping at her. Mira nodded, ""You have a boyfriend?"" ""Yes, he""s my..."" She gulped down the sick feeling trying to work its way up her throat, ""Boyfriend."" ""Why haven""t you told us this?"" Tamaki asked, looking at her with wide eyes. ""Because, he""s a punk!"" Mira lied, ""If my dad found out I was dating him, I""d never be allowed out of the house ever again."" ""What""s his name?"" The twins asked. ""Kazuma."" Mira answered, ""Kazuma Itsuki. He doesn""t go to this school."" She grimaced as she felt her insides beginning to push up more of her lunch at the thought of Kazuma as her boyfriend. She convulsed a little and held her hand over her mouth. ""Mira-chan, are you okay?"" Honey asked worriedly, seeing her now pale face. ""Yeah..."" She answered, ""I just threw up in my mouth a little bit."" ""You""re not sick, are you?"" Honey asked, Mira was about to answer, but he had already made up his mind, ""Takashi, we better get her to the infirmary!"" He said to Mori, who nodded and picked up Mira in his arms and began to take her to the infirmary, Honey close behind. Once the doors had shut, the host club began to mull over what Mira had said to them. ""A boyfriend..."" Tamaki said with sunken shoulders, ""There goes the ""blossoming romance"" plan...""

""Okay,"" Gordon accepted, hanging up the phone immediately. Miranda heard the constant hum of the phone line disconnected. She sighed, running her fingers through her hair. She didn""t want to go back to Arkham after seeing the Joker in his insane appearance. She took a deep breath, putting on her shoes and getting properly dressed into some comfortable clothes. As soon as she was ready, she immediately ran out of the apartment. She had no idea what she was getting herself into. Arkham was filled with police inside and out. As the cab drove off leaving Miranda still in her place, she stared with bewilderment. She entered into the building, feeling her legs shake with each step. She had never felt this nervous going into Arkham. She couldn""t stop her nerves from entering into her stomach. She finally met one of the leading police officers in the familiarly dull hallways. ""Excuse me, is Lieutenant Gordon here?"" she asked. ""Yes, I""ll lead you to him,"" the officer replied starting his way down the long, endless corridors. Miranda noticed many groups of police officers within the premises. They had clipboards in their hands, the sounds of walkie-talkies were distinct. The commotion made Miranda feel even more unsettled. ""Do you know what""s going on here?"" she asked curiously. ""Unfortunately I do,"" the officer replied. ""Apparently two of our officers were killed last night in Joker""s cellblock."" Miranda""s eyes widened with shock. ""How could that be possible?"" ""We don""t know. All we know is that

As she pulled the curtain, she couldn""t tell if their expressions were good or bad. Haruhi looked over at her too. Amelia ran a hand through her hair nervously, and laughed a bit. ""Is this okay?"" she asked. ""Are you kidding? You two are stunning!"" Tamaki shouted. ""Who knows with the two of them looking as good as they are maybe they could bring in some customers,"" Kyoya suggested. ""Especially for the foreign transfer student. That should be somewhat of a customer boost."" Amelia crossed her arms about her chest. ""And how exactly are we going to do that?"" ""By showing off your hot new looks!"" Tamaki insisted. The next day... ""Imai, Haruhi, you both have customers waiting for you today,"" Kyoya announced. ""Haruhi you""re table is over there and Imai over there. Have fun boys and don""t disappoint.""

""Yeah you too,"" Haruhi returned as they went to the tables filled with woman who were apparently dying to meet them. Amelia looked over at the girls taking a breath and smiling. Just be cool. Be yourself...well sort of. Just don""t say the I""m-a-girl part. Here it goes. She felt like the others were burning a hole behind her back. Fun, she is stalked by guys and has to entertain girls.

I had to brave these trials and others during my many adventures. My name is Aria, and this is my story... It all started one evening ten years ago. My best friend Hazel and I were sitting in the forest together, talking and playing as we usually did. Everything was calm and peaceful, but in one instant, all that changed.

I continued to stare, not seeming to hear her. She stood up next to me and shook my shoulder gently. ""Aria? ARIA!"" I was startled out of my thoughts by her urgent call. I replied to her in a decievingly calm voice, ""Something is wrong, Hazel, terribly wrong."" I could smell an acrid stench, a fire maybe? She stared at me for a moment and then looked in the direction I just had a moment before. She didn""t notice anything suspicious. ""What is it?"" she asked me, confused.

I would guess that since I""m used to waking up this early at home, I would be perfectly fine with waking up this late today. But this morning was different. I was scrubbed and waxed and practically tortured. First off, they made me take off my clothes. Every single piece of clothing! I was completely naked. Then, these Capitol people walked around in circles around me, criticizing my every flaw. ""Ugh! Look at these legs! It""s like a jungle of hair!"" said one lady with pink eyes and sharp teeth. ""And those cuticles! Look at how they""re damaged!"" exclaimed a man with blue streaks of hair and pants that were, in my opinion, way too tight. There were three people on my prep team. All had that stupid Capitol accent, and each was morphed into something different. They really didn""t seem human. The Capitol people are a whole new species. The last person on my ""prep team"" was the weirdest looking of them all. She had different colored skin for every limb. Her left arm was orange, her right was blue, and her left leg was red, her right was green. She also had this pointy nose that looked like it could cause some damage, if used as a weapon. She didn""t say anything about me, but she studied me intensely. It made me uncomfortable, especially since I was still naked. They all ""beautified"" me, and got me into this dress that kind of resembled an orange. Well that figures, District 11 is almost always a fruit of some","{""output"": ""NO""}"

I haven""t been so up for embraces lately, guess I was still depressed. But sooner than later Peeta is my arms, his face nuzzled in my hair. I trace his muscles in his back with my fingertips, feeling his warmth. My heart fills up the way it did in the arena. The arena is a horrible place in my heart but deep down I come to agree that if there was no arena there would be no Katniss Mellark, The Girl on Fire or the Mockingjay, things that are so valuable to me. Things that define me. I gently but passionately kiss Peeta before saying, ""Thank you for being there for me. Thank you for your company. Thank you for that bread that gave me hope."" Peeta smiles and opens his mouth to respond but before any words come out I say, ""I love you Peeta Mellark."" ""I love you too Katniss Everdeen."" Peeta take me down for a long kiss. He has never gotten to come to saying ""Katniss Mellark"" he says ""Katniss Everdeen"" seems to fit me just fine. When he finally does let me pull away from his grasp, he says, ""Now, finish your stew. I didn""t spend 6 hours working on it for nothing."" I laugh, for the first time in awhile, even at such a lame joke. I finish the stew with Peeta massaging my back and braiding my hair. I remember the day on the balcony before the interviews for the 75th Hunger Games. How could I have been so stupid not to entirely trust this man and love him for eternity. ""Lets go

I decided to start exploring, and so i started walking i walked onto some snow a little way from where i woke up. There were all these posts around me that looked sort of like trees so i started climbing. Once i reached the top i was suddenly thrown backwards and of the tree thing. What was really weird was that i saw these strange white eyes for a second right before i fell. After i brushed myself off, i decided to keep to the ground from now on and so i started walking again and after a while i found myself walking over some sand with cacti all around. It was weird that there was a desert so close to the snow. I continued walking and after a while i found this wall of cacti with this strange structure in the middle. It was made of something that looked like cobblestone but it was all covered in moss. What was really strange was that i thought that i saw those same strange white eyes in one of the windows but when i looked at it i didn""t see anything. I had probably imagined it but something was nagging at me. So decided to go see what was inside of the structure but when i passed the wall of cactus these strange creatures suddenly appeared.

They turned to see a crow on the balcony with glowing red eyes. With a wave of his hand, Hikaru opened the window and the crow set itself on his finger. Hikaru winced when the crow pecked his finger before morphing into a black envelope with a red seal. ""Is that. . ."" Kaoru trailed off as Hikaru opened the envelope, pulling out a small letter. He silently read over it and replied, ""It""s from Mother."" ""What does she want?"" Kaoru asked while leaning over his shoulder to peek at the letter. The older twin playfully pushed him off and gave him a quick kiss. Cupping his cheek, he pulled the younger twin closer. ""Mother wants to talk to us at the castle. She won""t visit the human world."" ""Because she fears that she doesn""t fit in?"" Hikaru nodded while throwing the letter aside. ""And since they cancelled school, we""ll visit her around lunch.

Kukai, the Charas, and I listened to every word the two had to say, and we didn""t miss a single detail. By the time the two finished, it was late in the afternoon, and the sun was starting to set in the distance. Namine stood up where she was sitting and smoothed out her dress. ""And that""s it."" The two of us stared in disbelief before I stood up and headed for the kitchen. That night, Kukai and I got ready for bed, still thinking about what Namine and Riku told us. ""Hey Kukai?"" ""Hm?""

""Yaya?"" He turned to me and I gave him a soft kiss. He responded by wrapping his arms around my waist and pulling me close. ""So horny."" Was the only thing he said with a smile. I grinned at him before kissing him again. He slams me on the bed as our tongues fight for dominance, but I end up losing.

The three boys started talking, but she couldn""t quite hear them. They sounded so far away, like their voices were on another planet and taking a long time to get to her. Pressing her palm against the cold floor, Maddy realized that she had laid herself down and that she was resting her head on one of her arms. ""This feels nice.' Her eyelids were getting heavy. ""What about..."" ""Oh crap!"" ""Hey!"" someone was shaking her shoulders, but she didn""t want to open her eyes just yet. ""Not when I""m so comfy.'

Maddy vision went in and out focus, which was really annoying especially while she was trying to count the green flecks in Derek bright blue eyes.

I grabbed a nearby hoe and used that as a makeshift crutch and hobbled out. Herobrine was at the doors, trying to pry them open but suddenly dropped. When I reached him, the flames were licking up everything on the walls, devouring the tapestries and shattering the glowstone lights. I pried at the doors, before realizing they were push doors. I swung them open and with the best of my power dragged him out into the snows. The temple burned, the nether brick only fueling the hungry flames. Outside the members of the temple gathered, the few enderman staff, the two ninja men who had helped with the kidnapping (whom had not been forgiven), and Herobrine and myself. To make everything worse, a drenching downpour bucketed over us. The flames still burned and we had no where to go (we had destroyed the nearest village and the others were over a days trip away). ""What do we do now?"" I asked looking at the others. One of the kidnappers spoke next, ""We are actually looking to you for answers. You are his companion in a way so you give us the answers."" With that I became a leader. Not a very good one of course, I had never had any experience as a leader of any type.

The panting eleven year-old went to stand over the edge to watch his black-haired best friend glide over the surface, making ripples in the normally serene lake. If his best friend loved the water, Makoto loved watching his best friend in the water. Makoto had known Haruka ever since he can remember. The black haired boy only had two things in life that he ever showed care for: water and mackerel.

Actually, they""re the only swimmers their age in the village. No one else really bothers to go to the lake because it was supposed to be a home for the gods. Haruka and Makoto were also forbidden but since Haruka loves water and Makoto cannot let Haruka go alone, there they were, spending another afternoon in the lake. Makoto sat on the edge of Haruka""s favorite little diving cliff, his gaze following Haruka""s form as he paddled back and forth, seemingly never getting enough of the water flowing against his body.

And neither of them knew if it made anything better. In the end, it didn""t really matter. ""You good now?"" Hyde whispered as Tina""s sobs receded into sniffles and then silence. Mutely, she nodded. ""I got your shirt wet,"" she whispered hoarsely, staring at the giant wet spot making his button up see through. ""It""ll dry."" Gently, he wiped his thumbs along the bottom of her eyes, his eyes soft as he stared down at her. Inside her head, Tina muddled around for words. She wanted to say something. But what could she say? What could make this better? Because anything else but better for Steven Hyde would be a failure. But she couldn""t find anything. So instead she leaned up on the tips of her toes, taking his sunglasses off and tucking them into his shirt. Slowly, Tina wound her arms around his neck, pressing her lips softly to his cheeks and then his his eyes as

You wouldn""t think that someone as cushy as her would look like she could slit your throat and then laugh over your corpse. She made it work. Deep scarlet painted her lips and dark makeup accentuated the icy depths of her eyes as they slowly ran over to us. Standing just behind her, flicking his fingers over an open flame was a man of Native American descent in a leather vest, his hair long and dark as it swept to his shoulders. ""I didn""t know that we invited them to a free for all fucking barbeque,"" the blonde woman quipped, giving me a long once over and then a slow smile. I looked away. The last one, his shoulders hunched in like he was trying to curve in on the human sitting just beside him. He made my blood go cold, my heart rate picking up just in time as his eyes flicked up and he gave a lazy smile. This had to be Eric Northman. There was no other answer to the utter predatory power that this man exuded. A black tank top hugged every curve of his chest, accentuating his defined arms and shoulders. He was attractive - there was no way that I would ever deny that. Sandy blonde hair hung down to his chin, where a light splatter of stubble softened his powerful jaw. The most striking thing about him were his eyes - wasn""t that what it always boiled down to? They were cold and calculating, blocks of ice in the Alaska sea, frothing over at the edges.

A wallet with a student I.D, 5000 yen, some receipts and punch cards for random convenience stores. She had a few changes of panties and bras, for days when she really didn""t feel like sneaking back home. Text books for a school she hardly went to. A hello kitty diary. Her cell phone. One make up bag, including a toothbrush, mini hair brush, tampons , pain killers, and her left over birth control. A game boy color. Napkins. A carton of cigarettes. Matches. A green iPod nano with a sticker of a Bulbasaur on the back, secured with tape so it wouldn""t fade. A camera, and various photos floating around the bag, along with rolls of used and unused film. The latest issue of Shojo Beat (She just couldn""t get enough of the romance and drama it supplied her with). A can of mace, just in case. Ray ban sunglasses. A box of Mario Band-Aids. Packets of Splenda. Small jars of different sorts of jelly and jam you would find at hotels. A old Sailor Moon address book from the eight grade she still used, but with numbers of people that probably wouldn""t talk to her. My neighbor Totoro portable chopsticks with a small spoon. A pouch of pencils, pens and markers. A key ring with ten different key chains and two keys, one for her house and one for her ex boyfriends. Thinking about him made her stomach go up to her throat. Her eyes burned with tears again. Looking away from the bag, she returned her attention to the lighter, and the cigarette laying on her lap. The red head

So of course I would know about your fateful accident, the one that stole both your husband and your unborn child."" He went on with a slight pout, ""It""s all quite sad really, your life has been nothing but a big tragedy. Nothing but a poorly written drama."" He reached out and moved her bangs from her eyes, which were wide. Angelina could not stop herself from trembling as he touched her, because she knew everything he was saying was true. ""But the sad life you have lived has turned you into such a marvelous woman. You paint the streets of London with beautiful red, teaching those whores a lesson."" He smirked at her, and her heart skipped a beat, ""I am unable to have a child because I am a man, and your ability to bear fruit has been taken from you."" He dragged his gloved fingers over her cheek, ""But I say we work together, to right the wrongs that have been forced onto us. You and I should paint the town red together."" He drawled out the last sentence, his teeth making the words drip with venom. Angelina looked at him with conflicting eyes as he finally drew his hand back. He""s like a monster from a fairy tale.

It was strange that a bond that was designed to hurt them both actually seemed to be bringing them closer together. Stray thoughts had been bouncing between them since the bond had been created, but the feelings that they had were what really raged through. It was comforting to feel what the other was feeling without the usual interference of that unwritten rule that they had almost always followed. They never shared what they felt deep down.The comfort continued as twilight finally came. Scully had now spent the past ten minutes trying to figure out why she and Mulder had given up so easily, especially Mulder. There was no explanation for it. Scully knew that she would have, very reluctantly, given in eventually, but Mulder would have had to have been dragged away. They both knew this to be true, yet neither could fathom why they had left. It was this same wondering that Scully had experienced earlier that day when she had found the brochure. She""d had it the whole day, was even curious about it when Alyssa had found it, yet never acted on the impulse to check it out. It was as that thought crossed her mind that they both instantly knew why they had left. Alyssa had made them go and they didn""t even bat an eye as they had left her.Mulder cursed himself for not realizing it sooner. The sensation was similar to, but not quite like, what Pusher had done to him. The only difference was that Alyssa had been less intrusive, yet more forceful, and she did not need

Text2: I""ll be honest, I think the best stories of the series where in the first season up to the fifth season. Not to bash the other seasons, but the stories were never as they were since the show moved to LA. Of course for the obvious fact that the show was no longer in Vancouver, but the writing just seemed to change. I really wanted to bring back somewhat of that ""Monster of the Week"" vibe and keep Mulder and Scully as partners and nothing less. Of course, I did have to add in a little flirting between the two. I wanted to give a real story, and I""m in no way bashing other fan stories out there, but a lot of them are only based on MSR, and I wanted to make a real X-Files story, like one which would could somewhat imagine coming out on television.

Yet I didn""t exactly want it to be a small town. So I went with Olympia. As it turns out I have a friend who lives not too far from Olympia and she found it nice that I had mentioned a few real places that she knew about. Q: Why go with a demon and not just a monster?

The coffee shop resembled Anteiku in many ways. Touka leaned against the counter,addressing the small group seated in front of her,which included Yoriko and his beloved Kaneki. Hide pulled open the door and was greeted with the familiar sound of the bell above it. ""Hey guys."" He greeted,taking a seat by the window. ""Hey Hide.""The group called back in unison.

Shigure had gotten to his feet as well, the bag of the few remaining jelly buns in hand. The elf-like woman before him studied him uncertainly for a moment. They had shared a conversation and he had helped her track down her dog, but that didn""t mean she knew him. She hadn""t meant to see him again. Finally, with one last look at his smiling, and undeniably attractive, face, she made up her mind. ""I suppose it wouldn""t be very good for business if I denied customers. But don""t be surprised when I try and sell you something,"" she joked. As they began their walk, Shigure restarted a conversation. ""Is the artist any good?"" Tal gave him a dry smile.

Text2: Then he heard a door slam from the opposite direction of his sister""s rant. Sighing, he reached under his bed to find the envelope of cash he kept there. He had a feeling this was going to be one of those nights. He was right, of course. His mother had come out of her room to see what her daughter was going on about, only to find that her socially challenged son was to blame for both the noise and the great despair of her only little girl. It was when he had heard them talking about coming up to get things straight that he got up and locked his door. The banging and demands that he open that door at that moment would only last until his father got home. They wouldn""t stop until then, so he put his headphones in his ears and turned up the volume. They were smart, he supposed. And determined. They could give into their tiredness of voice and fist and leave him be until later, but then his father wouldn""t be in a suitably enraged mood from once again entering his home to chaos with his son at the root of it. Kai rubbed his jaw. ""Well, that""ll bruise. Suoh won""t leave it alone tomorrow.' The young man was walking through the dark streets. The path was familiar to him, as he had traveled it many times before. His destination was a small restaurant, the kind that was family owned and could be traced back generations. The man behind the counter called something into the kitchen before walking toward Kai, who had unceremoniously flopped into the first seat he had come across. ""Again, boy?"" Kai smiled slightly, but it only brought on a grimace as his jaw popped. ""You say that every time,","{""output"": ""YES""}"

I let my mind drift as she spoke, letting the words drift past me and float away on the breeze. I only jolted back to reality when I heard the distinctive ring of nails against glass- the first name was being pulled. I held my breath in a silent prayer; please not Elsa. Please. My sister was all I had left of my family, apart from my grandmother who was nearly senile. Her mind seemed gone most of the time but sometimes she snapped back to reality and I caught a glimpse of the woman who had raised two children alone... but that only lasted minutes.

Then Jesse called me over. ""I think... I think this might be it."" He had his fingers on a line in the wall and his other hand flat on the dirt. I felt the wall. It certainly didn""t feel like sand or soil. The line Jesse had his fingers on ran all the way to his nose, trailed along a bit further left, then plummeted down back to the ground. It was shaped like a door. I searched for a handle with my hands. There was none. A faint glow shone from the lines. Or I suppose... the doorframe. ""This is it."" I spoke so suddenly and confidently Jesse stepped back. ""Push on it"" I told him, ramming my shoulder into the door. Jesse stepped back further and then ran at the wall. It was enough to send a shower of sand tumbling at us and -to our great joy- cause the door to swing open. It was clearly made of wood. ""Perfect"" I sighed, grabbing Jesse""s hand. ""Let""s go.

It""s just that since it""s the day of the reaping I wanted to get some early hunting in. My name is in there a lot, so there""s a high possibility I""ll be a tribute,"" I said. Hojo gave me a hug. ""My name is in there way more times than yours. I was scared that I wouldn""t see you again,"" he whispered. I returned his hug and then he pulled back. ""Let""s go back together, okay?"" I nodded and we walked back to the district, after making a quick stop to the tree. Hojo went to his house and I went to mine. When I walked in, my mother was fixing my little brother, Sota""s, shirt. Sota did not look happy at all. It was his first year to be in the reaping. ""Sis! I don""t want to go!"" he shouted. My mother patted his head and told him it""ll be okay. He didn""t listen and ran to hug me. ""Sis!"" he cried. I patted his back and he let go of me, sniffling. I fished through my pocket and held out a small necklace in front of his face. The necklace was nothing more than a piece of string and a purple marble attached. ""What is this?"" he asked, examining the necklace in his hands. ""It""s a good luck charm. If you wear it, you""ll be safe,"" I said. His brown eyes lit up and he put the necklace on. Sota seemed happy until the bell rang throughout the town. It was time to go.

The taller girl picked up the college student and carried her to the car. ""Hey! Put me down!"" Sakura protested. She kicked and screamed until Komaku placed her neatly in the passenger""s seat of a blue Honda. ""I can""t believe you did that,"" Sakura sighed. Komaku grunted in response and started up the car. Within minutes of driving, the two arrived Tokyo University. Sakura jumped out of the car and stretched, taking in the warm bright sun. ""Sakura."" ""Yeah?"" ""Have a nice day."" Sakura looked away as Komaku blew a kiss and drove off. The college student walked on campus and noticed something strange. Everyone within a fifty feet radius was backing away with every step Sakura took. ""Do I smell or something?"" Sakura thought. She did remember to put on perfume in the morning. Sakura cautiously entered the school and the hallways were the same as the outside. Everyone was avoiding her and she didn""t know why. She found her classroom and as soon as she opened the door, everyone stopped their conversations and looked at her. They scooted back in their seats when she put one foot in the room. Sakura fell to her knees before taking another step. ""What the hell did I do?!"" she whined in her head. ""What""s up with you?"" In front of Sakura stood a tall girl in a black tank top and jeans. She wore a green plaid shirt as a jacket and had thin rimmed glasses in front of her silver eyes. She had silver hair that just barely touched her shoulders. She sort of looked like Komaku. ""Eh? I-I""m fine, really,"" Sakura stuttered. She stood up and dusted off","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Jenny gave me a small smile and continued to get ready. I went over to my closet and pulled out a green dress. It was a little paler than the bright color of my eyes, but it was still green. It was sleeveless, and had a low neckline. There was a ribbon around the waist that was a green slightly darker than the green of the dress. The dress went down to my knees. I put on a pair of green flats to go with it. My red hair was long, and super curly. After about 10 minutes of brushing, it finally got untangled. I left it down, not wanting it to get snarly again. It was a lot smoother and shinier than usual. Finally, I brushed some powder onto my face, to hide my freckles. I hated my freckles. ""Are you ready?"" I asked Jenny. ""Yes,"" she said in a quivery voice. Clearing her throat, she said ""Yes,"" again, this time in a much stronger voice. Good, it looks like my speech had some effect on her after all.

Watching, as he walked, the withered hand seeking it""s addiction, finally locating and drawing out the white cancerous stick. Bleached as white as bone. Lit and burning now in the darkness leaving behind bitter smoke and ashes. His father never looked so sane. He knew he could touch these thoughts, touch his father""s mind and have it open to him, like a latch on a spring - but he did not want empathy or any other dimension to what he was seeing. The shock of his father""s dispassion did not wane but seemed to aggravate a void deep within him. Perhaps even before a blazing shell had left its muzzle with a deafening bang, a dark universe had been born. It waited for him, from time to time it beckoned, but he was not yet ready to tap this world or to want to explore or realize it. But it had always been there - denied. Staring back at the room where his body certainly lay, he found he no longer wanted the experience. He only wanted to be still, perfectly still. And lost. Until he ceased to exist. Death. He came to with a sharp sense of nausea and discomfort. For a split second he felt the yearnings of something he thought he had lost - a body. Dry mouth, a tender twist of nervous energy all about his ribs that shifted away, ghost-like. Much like his mercurial partner. The Companion was gone. And his eyes not so much adapted to the darkness of their division - the darkness adapted to him. As if sensing the inopportune, the lamp before him went out with a mournful hiss. He knew she was up above somewhere,

Text2: A human. A human dare come here, to his woods? His first thought was to dive and flame her until nothing was left but a chard cinder of flesh, nothing but the remainder of life. That would teach the humans to violate his sanctuary. He even pulled back his wings a bit, to dive, and dropped lower to the trees. If nothing else he would scare her to death, the full glory of a enraged dragon falling on her from the sky. That would send her running for her human communities and solid black rivers that cut through all the land like claws ripping flesh. The thought that saved him from making a grave mistake was the sudden image of his fall upon her from the blue heavens. She might not run in fear; she might slay him outright. Humans never used to let their females slay, but who knows how they could have changed in the past hundreds of years? He was no expert on their behavior, that was for sure. Best to wait and watch and bide his time. It was obviously apparent the flame-haired human was running already. Surely not from him? She hadn""t even looked up, and he made sure to put her between him and the sun so no shadow would fall in her path and give him away. To ensure from future possible sightings he gave the thread of Old Magic a tug, wrapping himself and letting the morning sunlight fall through him. She could look up now. Her gaze would pass right through him, all she would see was sky. And no shadow of his would touch the ground until the spell was removed. The new invisibility gave him cover to drop still lower.

No...it couldn""t be. A nightmare, perhaps? Yeah, that""s it, a nightmare in daytime. ""So...where""s Aya?"" she asked, tipping the water bottle up. Yata blushed at the girl""s name.

I say, as soon as she opens the door. ""What is it, Katniss?"" she asks. ""I may have left Peeta with the impression that I will be posing nude for him tomorrow."" Madge""s brow furrows with intrigue. ""And are you going to pose nude for him tomorrow?"" she asks. ""Of course not!"" I say. ""Why not?"" she says. ""Because it""s Peeta! He can""t see me naked!""

Grumpy, I decide to talk to someone else. I go home and dial the only number that seems a viable option. ""Effie?"" I say into the phone. ""Katniss! To what do I owe this pleasure?"" I""m beginning to wonder, myself. It had made perfect sense as I walked home. Effie, Peeta""s aunt from the Capitol who I""d met a few times, was the only older woman I knew who I felt could possibly listen to my predicament without everyone in town hearing about it. But as I hear her Capitol-infused voice, I begin to wonder if talking to her was such a good idea. ""I""ve gotten into a bit of an awkward situation with Peeta,"" I start out. ""Oh no,"" she says.

""Bye, Mother, see you at the Reapings,"" he said. His mother glanced up at him and then returned to her magazine, turning the page. It didn""t matter, though; Ambrose didn""t listen for an answer. Soon enough, he was out the door. An hour later, Ambrose was with his girlfriend Fleur, who was trying to talk him out of volunteering. ""Amby, I think I""d die without you,"" she declared. ""You can""t leave me!"" Ambrose rolled his eyes, not for the first time. They were hanging out outside the Reapings, waiting for the doors to open so they could go in, sitting on a bench.

""And you were able to help me with the still unexplained Succubus phenomenon."" Skinner added. Scully rolled her eyes as she grabbed her bag and headed for the door without a word. She had never been completely convinced by the succubus theory. Mulder felt a lump form in his throat at her departure. ""Today had been better"" he thought to himself ""So why no goodbye?' Mulder slowly became aware that Skinner was revealing his innermost thoughts to a completely oblivious psychologist, namely himself. ""Sir?"" Mulder interrupted ""It might be more advisable for you to write down everything that you can recollect from your dream and let me have a copy so I can thoroughly look into this for you."" ""Okay Mulder..."" Skinner hesitated having noted a change in Mulder""s tone ""Is everything okay?"" He asked concerned. ""Fine, Sir."" Mulder replied, realizing he need to say something to lighten the mode he jested ""I just always thought there could be something more between the two of us, you know?... Hearing your dream, though...wow."" Mulder was smiling and it was evident in his voice along with his sarcasm. ""Very funny, Mulder!"" Skinner exclaimed. Mulder was the best profiler and psychologist he knew but the man could be an ass at times, he was at a loose as to how Dana Scully put up with him. ""Sorry Sir."" Mulder said before adding seriously ""Get me those details and I will see what I can come up with. You know, dreams are fascinating things, they often answer questions that our conscious minds haven""t even posed. They can be very insightful.

548,"Text1: I found a good place to mine, but halfway through my exploring I encountered lava, so I left that till later. I broke into a speedy sprint, but pulled back sharply. For then I saw an ocelot ""climbing"" a tall jungle tree. I figured since the ocelot was far away from me, I could run home without scaring it. It didn""t work. I search the area hopelessly, wanting to find at least two spiders because at the rate a scared animal can run, he could be all the way to another island by now. I turned around hoping I might have more luck with a wolf. I found one in the middle of the desert, and hoped that I could tame it with one bone. I walked up to it and gave it a bone, and it loved me! I went back toward the jungle, scanning my eyes over the horizon, looking for any trace of the ocelot, but there was none. My head drooped dejectedly, and I trudged back to my house. What was there gave me such a shock, that I nearly died! It was the ocelot that I saw earlier! Suddenly I heard a spider""s dying shriek behind me. I turn around and see my dog standing behind two solid pieces of string. I thank him and grab the string, running to my nearby crafting table. Two sticks, two string, I mutter under my breath. In a matter of two seconds, I had crafted a fishing rod, and ran to the nearest water-hole. Must get fish...Must get fish, I mutter under my breath. I finally catch three, but when I turn, I can""t find the ocelot. I sigh inwardly in disappointment. Mew....Mew...Meow. I jerk in excitement, and joy. I suddenly remember not to make a sound, but

Text2: One more push indeed did the trick, heaving a child into the world of the living. Sadly, this move also catapulted the woman named Arannia into the world of the dead. A few frantic shrieks of Arannia""s husband, Coryn, were heard, but then all was silent. A shrill cry rose up into the day, confirming the fact that the newborn was a girl. Terra, the midwife, rested her callused hand on Coryn""s shoulders, looking down on the newly born and the newly dead. Coryn""s shoulders shook with his grief as sobs wracked his body. ""How could this happen?"" Coryn choked out, looking at Terra helplessly. Terra merely shook her head. ""Our current medicine is not advanced enough to cure death in childbirth,"" the woman explained quietly. ""But she was a strong woman, not a weakling! How could Arannia die from something so natural?"" Coryn argued, ignoring the squirming, bloody heap his newborn daughter was currently spending her first few moments of life in. Terra sighed and picked up the newborn girl, obviously being the only one to remember her existence. She rocked the baby back and forth, cooing gently to the child. ""What will you name her?"" Terra inquired gently. Coryn shook his head grievingly. ""Arannia had had the perfect name for her, she said. She said that she was going to be fine, but she wasn""t fine!"" Terra raised an eyebrow and held the newborn closer to the warmth of the folds of her robes. The stricken man continued his rant. ""Arannia was everything to me. She was my moon, my sun. How can I enjoy the naming of our daughter if she is not here to enjoy it with me?"" Coryn halted himself and stared at the child, who had begun to cry. Terra pulled the girl closer","{""output"": ""NO""}"

He turned back to look at Stiles and suddenly found his arms full of the younger. Stiles broke away and turned the hug on his father, pulling him out of his chair.

Text2: ""There""s also a dinosaur here."" I said as Teep jumped off the tree still running. Zoey finally caught up as Teep ran into a nearby valley. Zoey raced ahead trying to catch Teep. The valley split into two directions, and Zoey went left thinking that""s where Teep went, but ended up going the wrong way. I kept close to Teep when the dinosaur ran into a cave. I pulled out a Red Matter Sword, that I had built a few days back. I noticed that Zoey had realized she had been going the wrong way and turned back to follow me, so I asked, ""Are you ready?"" ""Ready."" Zoey said. I ran into the cave first and was plunged into total darkness. I kept going following a light in the distance. As we made our way through we came to a torch on the wall. and a small tunnel leading into a room. We walked in and I spoke ""Hello, Teep."" I walked up to him ""What are you doing here."" I asked. I got no reply. ""Can you talk?"" Teep shook his head. ""Progress."" I muttered. ""Will you try to kill as again?"" I said readying my sword. Again Teep shook his head. I didn""t trust him yet, but I allowed myself to relax slightly so I wouldn""t come off as a threat. I was about to ask another question when Zoey asked ""Do you like Mooshrooms?"" This time Teep nodded and went into his chest and pulling out mushrooms and handing them to Zoey. I figured we could trust him if he was willing to give away some items ""We need someone to guard our fort. Could we trust you to, basically keep watch?"" Another nod. So we left the cave with another ally. For the very few","{""output"": ""NO""}"
550,"Text1: ""Well, I guess I""d better get going now"" she muttered. She was not planning on talking more than was necessary with any of the other tributes. Besides, one of them would be dead soon enough, she just hoped it was Cato and not herself. Cato dealt with conflicting emotions as she saw her start to leave. Yes, she was from District 12, yes she upstaged the Careers with her stupid flaming outfit, and yes, she would probably be killed by his hands in the arena, but something about her wanted him to stay and talk...but she was not giving him an opportunity to do. As she started to leave he instinctively reached out to stop her, but immediately withdrew when she glared at him. He should choke her right now...or kiss her...or hurt her, really badly....he couldn""t make up his mind. He wanted both, the pain and the pleasure, but he was confused as to why he should want both. Since when has he given a crap about a girl? Especially one who might prove to be a threat during the games...unless it was to win her trust, only to stab her in the back later...yes that was it, that was why he wanted to talk to her he convinced himself. Katniss gave him an odd look before walking past him. What was that about? Had he seriously thought about hurting her even before the games started? One thing she knew was that she had to stay away from him. The next day passed by with nothing special to commemorate it, other than the tributes receiving their scores, with Katniss surpassing everyone. She was the talk of the capitol, her and her lover Peeta were being discussed by so many ""Fans"" and ""Supporters"", and already people were placing bets that

There was far to many people on the ship to have NO ghost. ""Not so much as boring as it is hard to concentrate."" I muttered in defeat, glaring at the PDA.

Mary looked out towards the thicket, squinting into the darkness of the underbrush. Max was still inside of the house as the lack of noise began to bother Mary. They both had gotten used to the sound of nature in the 10 years living out in the woods-almost as a comfort. The silence was foreboding but Mary directed her attention at Allison to keep her from noticing the slight worry coming over her. ""What""s wrong, Mom?"" Allison stood up, walking towards her mother. ""Nothing, kiddo-we should make some lunch with Dad,"" Mary smiled uncomfortably and turned toward the house. The silence was joined by a bright light that blinded Allison and Mary. The light grew and was joined by a screeching noise, along with wind that knocked Allison to the ground. ""Mommy! Daddy!"" Allison was screaming as the wind tossed her into the flower bed, her hands were over her eyes. She heard nothing back, no other noise but the screeching rang in her ears. The wind stopped blowing and the screeching stopped suddenly. The light was the last thing to fade away, leaving the sounds of the forest to return to normal. Allison, still half stunned in the flowerbed, opened her eyes, rolled onto her stomach and looked back toward the spot where her mother was. She could see the top of her head as she pulled herself up to her knees. Mary was lying face down in the grass, her hair a mess, and her body was lifeless as Allison crawled towards her. ""Mom?""

She glanced down at Hisoka who had put away his walkie talkie but made no move. Either he hasn""t noticed them or is waiting to see if they""ll make a move. And they haven""t seem to notice me either so it""s him they want. Understandable since he""s a clear threat to the other applicants. I""ll just chill up here until one of them make a move. No one made a move until the sun started to go down. Hisoka slid his foot back and leaned forward. ""Well, come on out,"" he said. Haley saw Gon tense and crouch further into the brush. ""I know you""re there. If you won""t come out, I""ll come to you."" Hisoka stood up and walked to where the guy with the spear hid. Hisoka stopped a few feet away from where they were both hidden and the spear guy stood up, made a flashy move with his spear that nearly hit Gon, and made some speech about how he was going to take Hisoka""s life. Haley covered her mouth with her hand to stifle the laughter that threatened to give away her spot. The man started to jab his spear at Hisoka and Hisoka only responded with dodging.

At that time, Russell was in no danger in a way, since Fliqpy didn""t kill him if he had no chance of defending himself. Lumpy was one of the last to be killed, and he was afraid of Fliqpy killing Russell, so he did his best to protect him. Lumpy raced passed the girls and headed into town. ""Hey hold up!""

Unbeknownst to the ignorant eye, what followed after entering the close was not a larger space to change; rather, it was the entrance to a black room that resembled something of an enlarged prison cell. The right side of the room was occupied by two large, obsidian tables. Each carefully upholstered various leather, metal and plastic intricately designed sexual toys. They all had a separate space from one another, showing that a few of the objects had been missing. To the far left, stood a tall, metal but untenanted St. Andrew""s cross.

He swallowed hard as that smile sent his temperature rocketing towards the stratosphere and for a split second any snide remarks or trademark comments about their quest for the jewel that had been waiting in line on the tip of his tongue fell back, unsaid. But a split second was all Kagome needed to worm her way out of his grasp and the next moment InuYasha found a shiny package being shoved into his hands. He silently cursed her for the way she smiled, the way she smelled, the way she moved, the way she laughed the way she.the way she was. Lately, whenever she was near, it was a miracle of fate that he just happened to wear baggy pants. She did things to his mind and body that no one ever had, not even Kikiyo. She was loud, strange, stubborn, proud, willful, pushy, and annoying. He didn""t understand it, and that pissed him off. She made his blood boil, with anger one minute, and with something else entirely the next. But he""d be damned before he let her know that, so he set a pouting scowl on his face and did his best to look annoyed and disinterested in the shiny gift in his claws. ""Here you go! Merry Christmas, everyone!"" she announced cheerily as she passed out gifts. There was a moments hesitation, but at Kagome""s prompting, they ripped off the wrapping paper with varying degrees of voracity. Shippo got a sketch book and a box of crayons with every color imaginable (one of the big ones). Sango got a bath kit with scented soaps, body sprays and even some barrettes for her hair.

Text2: He trailed off, seeming suddenly to run out of steam as his fingers curled into loose fists and lowered to his sides. His head lowered too, so that his golden locks brushed down around his face, and Haruhi could barely see between the strands as the sapphires of his eyes were secreted under heavy lids. He sighed and when he spoke, it was with a quiet sincerity that put all the flash and fanfare of the ritual to shame. ""Please... Bereznoff... I just want her to love me... the way I love her..."" he whispered, and his eyes closed the rest of the way. Stunned, Haruhi was helpless as the creature of sensation sank its fangs into the middle of her chest, and that radiating ache glowed back to life, painful and wonderful, burning away the air in her lungs and leaving her breathless. Inadvertently, she sucked in a deep, shuddering, noisy-as-a-cannon-blast gasp. Nekozawa tensed instantly, whipping his upper body around to glare warily around the darkened room. ""Who""s there?"" he demanded, brows drawn down, curled fists tightening with anxiety. For a timeless, hanging moment, Haruhi thought her ghost was going to escape through her mouth as her hammering heart froze in her chest with an uncomfortable lurch. If he found her now, watching him perform a ritual to ask his gods to make her love him... if the embarrassment didn""t kill her, she may well commit hara-kiri. (Mother in heaven, help me, I""m turning into Tamaki-senpai...) Then time shivered, screeched and rumbled into motion again as the tiny girl beside her stirred, shot her a look that said ""I told you so"" plain as day, then squirmed forward and burst out from under the dust ruffle. Haruhi cringed backwards as the black fabric fluttered back into place. ""Onii-chama! Surprise!""","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The brat was getting faster these days but Ging still had to play down more than half of his normal speed to match him. Soon he reached the edge of a cliff and he looked down all the way to the bottom. Below was a small cove, enclosed with trees that took root at the shallower parts of the lake. The sun is almost down and they must hurry if they want to see the show start. He waited for three more seconds and the brat appeared at his side, slow but without breaking a sweat.

The snow was in perfect condition to make a snow man. Easy to shape, and strong enough to hold whatever form one molded it into. Tossing it to the ground, he slowly dropped to his knees, and started rolling it around to collect more snow, to increase the size of the ball. Steadily, it grew to the desired size. Picking it up, he waddled over to Hinamori, and sat it down beside her. She was already on her second snowball of the snowman""s body. ""Good job, Lil"" Shiro. That was fast."" she complimented. ""Yeah, yeah."" he said rolling his eyes, ""now what?"" he asked. ""Go find some sticks for his arms."" She said, stacking one snowball upon the other, and then placing the head Toshiro made on top.

Hinamori seemed to be giving him the easier jobs. Not that he""d complain. He didn""t feel like doing this in the first place. He decided that logically the best place to find sticks would be near the small patch of trees nearby. Digging around in the snow beneath them, he found two twigs of equal proportion with ease, and started back to the incomplete snowman. Staring up at it, wondering how Hinamori found this to be entertaining, he jammed the two sticks into the torso, one on each side of the snowman. Satisfied that his role in the matter was complete, he fell back in the snow, and stared up at the sky. It

By now, their customers had gathered around, and were leaning in anticipating what would happen next. Haruki started to feel worse for Kichiro as the moment went on.

He had seen many victims of rape before and compared to them, the Fullmetal was as calm as the pristine surface of peaceful ocean -with its rage and storm lay quietly underneath. Roy knew he was expected to understand. And so he did. After taking the bundle of report from Al""s outstretched hand, he quickly dismissed the younger Elric, expecting the other to be as pissed as he was at the situation which none of them could change and soon leave him alone to deal with his anger in peace. It took him one full minute to look up again and find the build of armor still standing resolutely on his place, small white eyes staring straightly to the paper on his hand. ""Colonel,"" Al began, a flare of hope flashing in that one short title. ""Is there any development in the investigation of Nii-san""s case?"" To answer seemed very difficult for Roy, but he eventually managed a short explanation, if a bit inadequate. ""I have sent a man from the investigation division to go to Northest Town but nothing of importance he has reported."" ""Oh."" Had Al could move a muscle of his stiff metal face, the Colonel would have seen a heartbreaking crestfallen expression. Roy studied him for a moment, noticing the straight posture the younger brother still maintained despite the downcast of his eyes, and decided that it would be rather rude to try sending him away once more while he himself was still the accused rapist of his brother. ""Are you sure you have told me everything you know?"" It was a cliché procedure when an officer was reluctant

After that he could merely look up, wishing to reach for the blue firmament while he knew there would never be a meeting between the earth and the sky. Hopes of the fools. Not that he loved Yamazaki Susumu - the idea was purely laughable. Anything that had occurred between them was of what a master might take from owning a subordinate - an exceptionally loyal subordinate, that was. He also highly doubted that the younger man had any affection for him more than what his profession had demanded from him, but for some reasons this night, he was willing to destroy all he and Souji had slowly and carefully fostered for a pretty much non-existent love. For a moment, the fukuchou found some difficulties to determine which of the most sordid and nastiest among scorns and curses to be coalesced with his name. Promiscuity. Souji tolerated such behavior, but did not approve it. It was why he had such immense respect for Yamanami who held his love only for one woman. Souji would forgive him no doubt, would not change his behavior and their interaction since it was how the world moved - it was how they lived, how everything rolled to past - but the scar would remain, irremovable.

It""s so simple. I can""t believe I missed it. All I have to do is..."" ""Spare me the explanation and just do it, McKay!"" Jane Sheppard looked worriedly at the shaking walls around them. ""Right."" He got to his feet and walked to the back of the machine and yanked on a long cord that had been plugged into a socket on one of the walls. The shaking, the constant spray of sparks, and the general chaos ceased to exist. Jane closed her eyes and clenched her fists in barely contained anger. ""Did you just do what I think you just did?"" Rodney smiled, proud of himself. ""Yes, I did. Guess it was even simpler than it looked."" Back in the Atlantis gate room, a group of young men and women, along with the rest of the team including a visibly relieved Ronon, circled both Rodney McKay and Jane Sheppard. ""How did you do it?"" asked an eager young man with dark brown hair. ""It was simple, really..."" McKay started. ""Were you not concerned you were going to depart this life?"" asked the other member of the team, Teyla. Rodney scoffed. ""Of course not."" Ronon rolled his eyes. ""So you didn""t want to give up? Not one second?"" Jane put a hand on his shoulder and smirked. ""It""s like I always say, Ronon,"" she started, leading him away from the group to face the gate. ""Never give up. Never surrender."" And with that, the giant Stargate tilted back and fell to the floor. ""CUT!"" The man she called Ronon threw his hands up in the air and said, ""Please","{""output"": ""YES""}"

A lot of brandy was consumed in there. More than what I""d like to admit, but we also had a lot of heart to hearts in there. Ciel found out about Marcelina in there. And we spoke of his first born in there...Wait a minute...No. We never talked about his son. That was Elizabeth and me over tea, not Ciel and me over brandy. Then, why did I remember Ciel, too? When I got my memories back, did Sebastian accidentally give me some of his...? I""m not saying it""s not possible, but maybe he did. Something to ask Adrian when we get back. ""By the way, my lord,"" Sebastian asked, ""How is that little button of mine treating you?"" ""What little button?"" I asked. ""Some of the demons weren""t taking heed of Marcelina""s warning,"" Ciel told me, ""The only one that""s allowed to administer any sort of torture upon me is Sebastian. To make me feel better, Sebastian was kind enough to give me the remote to the shock collar Marcelina put on Lucifer."" ""Lucifer?"" I gasped, ""Can I see that button?"" ""Go ahead,"" he handed me the remote. With great anticipation, I pressed the button and an earth-shattering scream echoed through Hell. ""That was Lucifer?"" I beamed. ""Yes, it was,"" Sebastian nodded, ""You wouldn""t want to do something silly like see him while we""re here, would you, Lumi?"" ""Here no,"" I shook my head, ""If I never see Lucifer again, it""d be too soon."" ""You and me both,"" Ciel agreed, ""Lumi, are you feeling alright?"" ""A little warm,"" I reported, ""Why?""

""Rhiannon,"" I steadied my arm, ""She""s my sister."" ""See, Rhiannon wasn""t in when I got mine done,"" he pulled his sleeve down, ""I had Carlos do mine."" ""Carlos does Rhiannon""s usually,"" I pointed out, ""Except for one. She""s got a stream of cherry blossoms going down her ribs that she had done by her mentor in Japan."" ""I thought her art style had a certain Asian quality,"" he approved, ""But I""d say Carlos did alright. I""m Wyatt."" ""Lana,"" I bit the inside of my cheek. ""Well, Lana,"" he smiled, ""It""s lovely to meet you. I""m sure I""ll see you around here more often, yeah? Since we do have the same class together."" ""Yeah,"" I blushed a little. ""Hey,"" Wyatt picked my chin back up, ""No need to be shy around here, ok?"" I just nodded, unable to speak anymore. Once the professor dismissed us, I made a beeline out the door. Wyatt was sweet. Don""t get me wrong. But...I can""t people too well some days. And today happens to be one of those days where I don""t want to make friends. There""s always tomorrow, though. But even better, once I got to the front steps of the Columbia campus, I had a little surprise waiting for me. ""Kyoya!"" I ran into my boyfriend""s arms, damn near tackling him right then and there on the sidewalk. ""Surprise,"" he gave me a soft and gentle kiss, ""Miss me?""

575,"Text1: ""Sleep peacefully,"" the small pixie chirped, and waved her tiny crescent moon wand before Sakura""s face. Just before the girl drifted off, the last thing she saw was the Dream Card spread her arms wide. Sakura knew she should have expected this. She had totally forgotten that a person dreams constantly when they were in REM sleep. (God, she was stupid sometimes.) So now, she was witnessing dreams that she never would have remembered if not for the work of her magic cards. She was soaring over mountains, over clouds. She went to school naked-much to her embarrassment-and, to her total surprise, she saw herself engaged to a man that looked awfully familiar. So familiar, in fact, that her cheeks grew warm. She was hovering above her own wedding with Syaoran. ""Sakura Li?"" She liked the way that sounded. Finally, just as she was about to give up hope of finding Isao and Kirika in her mess of thoughts and fantasies, she arrived in the alley between two dilapidated huts. As her feet touched the ground, she knew she was in the correct time period from the people passing by the small opening. Just to be sure, though, she tapped a woman who was peering around the edge of one of the tiny houses on the shoulder. ""Sumimasen, can you please tell me what year this is?"" The woman didn""t even make a move to respond, nor did she seem to hear her. ""Baka! It""s no surprise she doesn""t know I""m here. This is the Dream Card""s doing,' Sakura shook her head. ""Damn, there she is.' Those words reached Sakura""s ears, yet the woman""s mouth seemed to move. There was no one else close enough for Sakura to eavesdrop of his or her conversation.

Text2: The snow was still falling at the end of fourth period. Haruhi was gathering her books to head to her next class when the Hiitachin twins appeared on either side of her. ""Come see!"" Before she even had a chance to protest, she was being dragged out of the room by both arms. ""Cut it out, will ya?"" Haruhi insisted, pulling herself free. ""It""s okay, this is what we wanted to show you, anyway,"" Kaoru said, pushing open the double doors in front of them just a crack. It was only then that Haruhi realized that she""d been brought to the cafeteria. Peering through the opening Kaoru made just to humor him, she saw Mori sitting at a table, eating his lunch. Haruhi sighed. ""Is this all?"" ""No no, watch closer."" Reluctantly she did. Mori picked up a piece of salmon with his chopsticks. Slowly he brought it to his lips, only for it to slip out of his grasp and plop back down on his tray. He glanced at the fallen food blankly before picking it up again. Once more, it slipped free. He kept doing this, occasionally looking around the room as if lost. Haruhi couldn""t believe her eyes. She""d never seen Mori so much as spill a drop of tea, let alone completely and totally zone out like that. ""I don""t think he knows what to do without Hunny-sempai around,"" Hikaru offered, shrugging his shoulders. ""He""s so used to looking after him that not having that responsibility seems to have really thrown him off."" Kaoru chimed in. ""Earlier today in the courtyard he bumped face-first into a pillar then kept walking like nothing had happened. Pretty bizarre."" Haruhi couldn""t help but let her worry show.

""When she gave them to my father, he would wear them behind his ear or in his shirt pocket. My mom would braid them into her hair or put them on the dinner table."" There was a moment of silence. At last, Xanxus put forward, ""Massimo bought my mother flowers for mothers day every year. He never picked ones from the garden. He said she deserved something she didn""t see everyday."" ""You""re brother sounds like he was a good guy."" ""You""re sister sounds like a sweet girl."" Enma""s fingers fell from the flower. ""She never had a chance to be anything else."" Darkling Enma watched as Xanxus slept. Part of him wanted to reach out and wipe away the hair that had fallen into Xanxus"" face, but he knew the movement would wake him up. Which he really didn""t want to do. It wasn""t that he didn""t enjoy Xanxus"" company. It was just that when he was asleep, Xanxus managed to forget things. There was no anger, no guilt, no grief on his mind when he slept. Enma liked that he could have those moments, even if they were when he was unconscious. Dastardly ""I hate you."" ""You don""t,"" Enma answered. He held the bottle up to his face, whistling when he saw the label. ""This is good whiskey."" ""I know,"" Xanxus hissed. ""I bought it for me to drink."" ""I""m not much of a whiskey drinker, but I think one of the others will enjoy it."" ""They will not."" Xanxus ground his teeth together, ""I paid good money for that."" Enma hummed. He turned to face Xanxus, dropping the bottle so he held

I make it safely to the ground and feel my way around in search of the bathroom. In my quest, I successfully trip over a chair and stub my toe on a bookshelf. The doorway to the bathroom is also disproportionately large in comparison to my above-average height, so I stay to the right side, feeling my way in by use of the doorframe, my toe continuing to throb from its previous misadventures. God, why does this room have to be so confusing? I want to go home. To my room and my mom. And my normal-sized bed. Because I""m not paying attention, I run into the step that lead up to the sink, sending a sharp pain through my shins. Great. The other tributes won""t even have to kill me, now. I""m doing a pretty good job myself. Both my toe and shin throb in agreement with my thoughts. As I trudge up the stairs, I can""t help but become irritated at the fact that I""m actually going up stairs to reach the sink! Doesn""t the Capitol realize how impractical this is? Well, of course they do. It""s the Capitol. They know everything, right? Come on, we aren""t giants! Therefore, our rooms should not be furnished as though we were. I want to ask Theon what his room is like, but we aren""t exactly buddy, buddy enough for that. I don""t even know him.

His smile broadened as he took her hand, ""Excuse me ladies,"" he said winking to the line of girls. They all melted to the floor, as he walked off with Emiko. Taking her to the dance floor, the waltz started back up, and he started to lead, ""You wanted to speak with me?"" he asked, spinning her. ""Yes,"" she huffed. Still slightly irritated by his performance to sucker more girls into his line. She started to take the lead from him, ""the cosplay I ordered for Monday""s hosting hours might not make it here in time. The girls are really looking forward to it, but now it might not arrive until a day or two after the assigned date."" ""Is that all?"" he asked, stopping them both, and spinning her into him. ""Then we""ll just have to change the date. I""ll announce it to the ladies before the end of the night."" he winked ""No worries."" His hands were cupped over hers on her hips. Her back pressed against his front. She grew more frustrated, and wiggled from his hold. Straightening out her glasses she nodded, ""Understood."" after that she walked off. He was way too touchy feely for her liking. ""Next,"" called Tamotsu, holding out his hand to the first girl in line. Haruki had excused herself to the restroom to have a moment of silence.

Text2: streaks of ice being jabbed so far inside her skin that it was worse than hypothermia. This was true frost bite. When he finally released his clenched teeth, and licked the remains from the corners of his lips, his eyes reverted back to the gentle state of baby blue. She was still frozen by the feeling. She truly couldn""t move. He glanced over at her, and turned her head gingerly to look into his eyes, ""does it hurt that much?"" her lips trembled. A single tear escaped her eyes, and froze halfway down her cheek. He watched it carefully, and then kissed her on the lips. When their lips parted, she blinked, but winced in pain. ""I... better go clean this up."" she said referring to her shoulder, as she stumbled into the bathroom. Looking into the mirror her face was possibly paler than usual. She shook so bad, she couldn""t get a hold on the faucet handle. He followed after her and turned on the water for her. Taking a wash cloth he dabbed at the bite mark on the back of her shoulder. She stared at their reflection, and more tears came to her eyes. ""I forgot to mention that I possess ice. Taking this into consideration some of it might have seeped out when I bit you. I""m sorry. I didn""t mean to cause you pain. You""re shaking uncontrollably."" he explained. ""Please just leave me alone."" she whined, lowering her head. She couldn""t stand to look in the mirror anymore.

My shoe squeaked and I flinched. I dropped to my knees and carved a silence rune into my ankle and then into Nero""s. I pulled a bracelet out of my bag and drew the rune on it too. ""Here."" I handed it to Sammra. ""Put it around your ankle."" She did and we were all silent. Nero nodded. ""Ingenious."" I smiled and we continued on. After a moment Nero pushed us both against the wall and we all stilled. Two men were headed our way. ""Do something."" Nero sounded panicked. Sammra cast a quick spell and said, ""Stay as still as possible."" We obeyed and the men walked right passed us. It was Pangborn and Blackwell. I gasped and followed them. I was a little ways back so I couldn""t hear what they said to Clary and Luke but I did see Blackwell fall into the hall with a scalpel skittering across the floor. His throat was cut.

Now she could do nothing. ""Spyglass! Head for the computer. We""ll hold them off!"" Aqualad ordered as he pulled out his water bearers and was met with the challenge of a dozen leaguers. Layla surveyed the grim scene. She didn""t have much time. Her glowing green eyes watered as her feet pounded over the dirt of the cave and before she knew it, she was sitting at the control consol with the flute-man standing behind her laughing. Life was so unfair. She wished that guy would shut up so she could think. She wished the music would turn off, but the screen was locked! She wasn""t a genius hacker like Robin, and she couldn""t smash it to bits like Superboy. All she could do was sit hopelessly as the song played away and her mentors were forever captured by the innocuous melody.

I couldn""t concentrate on anything for more than a couple of seconds. I couldn""t remember anything from the previous day, besides the fact that my tributes names were Katniss and Peeta.

""Damn it!"" she said when recognizing that she had forgotten some paper for her mother""s present. It was not the first time for 3 years since she had left Washington D.C. and taken the new job at a medical laboratory in New York that she forgot a thing. Her new job was really hard - including working at night. She did so last night and - by God - she was not in the mood now to go to the paper shop, a 100 Santa Clauses crossing her way and everybody wishing her ""Merry Christmas"" and ""A happy new year"". Happy new year? Had she ever been really happy during the last three years? , Scully said to herself and remembered that she still had some paper of last Christmas on the loft.

A brunette was standing by the X Files cabinet, and she turned to face Mulder with a file in her hand. ""You were visited by a Banshee, or sometimes known as a Succubus,"" the woman said. The woman was Special Agent Monica Reyes, Agent Doggett""s partner and who was now assigned with Agent Doggett to the X Files unit. She was a believer, like Mulder. The two didn""t work much together before, but Mulder thought she was okay. ""A Banshee, huh?"" Mulder asked. ""What""s that when it""s at home?"" He asked. Agent Reyes sat at the other desk, reading from the file. ""A Banshee is a kind of jealous ghost, a jealous female ghost who visits men in their sleep during the night, gaurding them from any females that they are close to,"" she explained. ""This kind of ghost has a mournful wail as she is showing you she is a sign of misfortune,"" she said. ""An omen?"" Mulder asked. Reyes nodded. ""An omen of bad luck. You""ve got to be careful, Mulder,"" she said. ""Come on, Monica,"" Doggett said with a roll of his eyes. ""You""re not suggesting that Mulder saw an actual manifestation of a omen of misfortune, are you?"" He asked. Reyes nodded. Mulder thought for a moment. ""So, does this mean that, because I saw the ghost, I""m going to have bad luck?"" He asked. Reyes nodded again. ""It would appear so,"" she said.

Pulling out her contact pad, Aira flipped through the coded locations that her employer had sent her, and she scanned the sheet quickly. Didi""s Cafe, a well known and dodgy joint that held conspirators, criminals and senators alike. A good place to blend in. Taking a seat against the wall in one of the corners of the crowded restaurant, Aira politely ordered a concoction of freela and pomegranate juice as she waited. Her Jedi instincts that had never quite left her allowed her to listen to numerous conversations at once, but also made her suspicious of every action and motive. How could people live so ridiculously and recklessly? If her previous training had taught her anything, it""s that she was gifted to judge and meditate on every little irksome thing she found in humans and aliens alike. Waiting was Aira""s least favorite game after hyperdrive. Of course, she decided that if no one showed up within twenty minutes of the rendezvous, that she was probably being hoodwinked, set-up or cheated, and would leave. She never got the opportunity. A person wearing a dark brown cloak entered the boisterous atmosphere of the bar, though they seemed tentative. Aira watched interested. The man, Aira deduced, judging by his stiff demeanor and bulkier appearance... no, perhaps a boy, walked into the midst of the carousers and sat at an empty table hesitantly.

My skin was practically glowing bright red and my whole body ached as if I had been shoved inside a sand blaster and been hosed to within an inch of my life. But wait a second, my sun-scrambled brain shouted; Jesse just said I had fair skin! Could that mean he thinks I""m pretty? Or

He has realized of late that he has a habit of praying for her, and too her-has done it for years but never considered them prayers, only his desperate yearnings.

593,"Text1: I raised an inquisitive eyebrow. Was Kyoya purposing that we sneak around the house? Maybe he cared about Yuki more than I thought. As we walked around to the side of the house, we tried to look as casual as possible, and I wasn""t sure how good we were doing. Despite this, I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard Haruhi hiss, ""Look!"" She had somehow ended up at the front of the line, so she saw it first. She was pointing to a fairly large picture window a few feet in front of her. On the other side of the window stood Yuki and a man I could only assume was her father. Her appearance surprised me. Had she always been that skinny? So skinny her bones seemed to jut out of her skin? Or maybe it was just the over-sized clothes she wore. Come to think of it, she had always worn clothes that were too big for her (not counting her school uniform). Were they -- oh, what did commoners call them? -- hand-me-downs? I wondered how we had ever thought she was a guy. Her facial features were too delicate, her skin too pale, and well, I wasn""t too sure, but she definitely wasn""t guy-like. She was like a porcelain doll, fun to play with but easy to break. We crouched down into the grass, moving closer to the window. There was about four feet between us and the side of the house, giving us only four feet to hope we weren""t seen. It was harder than it looked. Yuki was standing near the door of the room, and her father was standing on an embroidered carpet near the center of the room. His mouth moved but no sound came out, and I realized

""You do not have to do it alone."" She tells him, and then she does the impossible. She reaches out and takes his hand. It is an unthinkable action, coming from a Vulcan; it is a symbol of unknowable tenderness. Beyond her pulse, he feels her mind moving swiftly, like water under a moat. He is aware that Vulcans are touch telepaths, but she has not initiated a mind meld, and so he knows what he feels next does not come from her. Katreen had held his hand like this, when he was sick, or when he was tired. When he was fussy, or upset, she had held him. So softly, her hand feather light, but she had been there. Katreen, wrapping him in a blanket, reading to him from a book, she had been there. When he had needed someone, wanted someone, she had been there. Always in the background, she had taken care of him, nurtured him silently. Loving him unconditionally, she had always been there. ""There are","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Sherlock inquired, scrutinizing his wasted flat mate who was singing very slurred karaoke to a song he was pretty sure was called ""Hot ""n"" Cold."" Sherlock had known of course that John was very, very drunk. Even a total moron could tell that. However, he was also sure there was something else wrong, something he could not quite put his finger on. He suspected it was some sort of social issue, which would explain why he was having trouble pin-pointing it. The bartender joined Sherlock in studying the drunken singer. ""I should know that you""re no good for meeeeee,"" John half-sang, half-shouted. ""He""s in love."" ""What?"" ""He""s in love,"" repeated the bartender, returning to washing glasses. ""He just broke up with his girlfriend."" ""Maybe he still likes her then."" ""But he broke up with her. Said there was a problem with their ""chemistry"" or something of that sort."" ""Then maybe there""s someone else,"" he said with a shrug. ""You going to order something?"" ""And end up like him? No thank you."" John finished his song and stumbled off the stage.

""So I came for nothing?"" Xelloss appeared depressed until Filia smacked him on his head. ""You came to support your friends!"" Lina watched the two with a twinge of jealousy. Although their bantering hadn""t seemed to change, it was clear that their relationship had. The rich southern beauty and plantation heiress, Filia ul Copt, had somehow managed to tame Xelloss Metallium, perhaps the most feared gunslinger of the time. ""Hey, where""s the kid?"" Lina wondered, noticing that a certain green-haired infant was not present. Filia appeared ready to burst into tears. ""He... he""s still at home. Jillas and Gravos are watching him."" Martina reappeared and placed a tea service in front of the blonde woman, momentarily distracting her.

A servant stood there, holding a young woman in his arms. Before my cellmate or I could say something, the slave through the woman in our cell. The door slammed shut, and at the same time Ant jumped up to check the lady that had been thrown in. I followed him to her, my heart racing. She looked like she was dead, or at the least very close to being dead. Ant picked up her hand and tried to feel for her pulse, as it was obvious that her breathing was very shallow and rough. Her purple-blue hair was matted with blood, and looked like a dreadful mess. She wore a black suit and red tie, and steampunk-like goggles were on top of her head, cracked. Her skin was a middle tone of olive. ""She""s alive, but barely."" I heard Ant say to himself. ""That""s good though, isn""t it?"" He looked at me strangely. ""I mean it""s better that she""s actually alive instead of dead."" I explained. He nodded and turned back to her. The lady""s pants were torn, showing a deep gouge in her right leg.

But it could never come close to what she felt inside. He had hurt her, betrayed her trust - in him, and in both of them. The totality of it all made her heart ache so much. And yet, here she still stood. Trapped in between Michael""s arms. Fighting a one-sided battle for something that will most likely destroy them both. She never seems to learn her lesson though - she still keeps on coming back. And she couldn""t stop. Like an addict that she was before. Only this time, she could never find it in herself to do so, to find a cure. Not with him. Not with Michael. She didn""t know how he could have this hold on her, have this control over her emotions, her thoughts... Her heart. She almost hated him for it. But she hated herself more for it too. She was supposed to be stronger than this. She never needed anyone in her life. So how did she become so vulnerable when it came to him? How did it ever come to this? In a strained voice, Nikita asked, ""Why are you doing this to me, Michael?"" He didn""t answer. Nikita closed her eyes briefly and then hung her head low. She couldn""t look at him.

""What the hell is going on in here?"" he asked, surveying the damage, the bloody towel Scully still held, the gun on the floor. ""Just a little domestic dispute,"" Mulder said with a wry smile. ""Nothing to worry about."" ""Thanks for your concern,"" Scully added. The man regarded them for a moment, chest heaving, looking torn between his desire to leave and what appeared to be a moral obligation to clock Mulder over the head with the baseball bat. Will stared hard at him, giving him a little push. The man stumbled backwards through the doorway. ""Right,"" he said, his hands dropping to his sides. ""I""ll be going. Keep your voices down.""

As a man, he had always felt that sex equaled a commitment in a relationship, that because they were sharing bodily fluids it meant something so much more than taking a walk together or gong out on a date. And yet, as he lay there with her, a realization dawned on him. He and Scully had never had sex, had not gone past anything more than a platonic kiss and a chaste hug, and yet he felt so much more for her than he ever would the woman lying next to him, or any other woman for that matter. It was thoughts of Scully that filled his mind as he walked towards the mother of his children. 14. Anger had gone away an hour ago, replaced by something so feral and tangible Scully felt she could literally pluck it out of the air and use it to break something-anything. Preferably the bones of one Fox Mulder. If he had let her in, had given her that all important trust that he held so near and dear, she could have helped him with this, could have yet again removed his ass from the licks of hell.

Not wanting to, but yet needing to more than breathing, she found herself yet again immersed into the desperate scrawling of her partner. Scully, Jesus, do even","{""output"": ""NO""}"

613,"Text1: The day after I realized my parents weren""t dead was the happiest day of my life. That day I did nothing but mine coal and chop down trees. I had five-hundred thirty-seven pieces of coal, and too many wooden planks to count. I went home and made five-hundred thirty-eight sticks. I crafted two-thousand forty-eight torches. I was able to make four torches for every piece of coal. Just crafting all of that over and over and over made me very bored. I can""t think of anything more tedious then placing a piece of coal and a stick in the same spot over and over again. After I was done with crafting all that I went to go sleep because it was dark outside and decided to continue my plan tomorrow. The next day I got up went outside and started walking in a straight line. When I couldn""t see the house anymore, I made a tall tower and surrounded it in torches. I basically just made a really bad lighthouse. I realized that I needed a sign so I went home and made a couple of signs. I went back to my lighthouse and put the sign next to the door saying home this way and an arrow pointing back to my house. I went back home and made three other lighthouses one for each cardinal direction. Chapter 8: I Visit Hell With my plan started I found out that the world was a lot larger than the area covered by my lighthouses. Instead of using the extra torches and planks to expand my house I decided to make some more lighthouses. I was able to make eight more lighthouses before the sun set. I made enough lighthouses to go all the way to the edge of the world. Then

I was still fuming about you pretending to know what it felt like, of you pretending to love those kids as they went into the arena, when we both knew you loved the Capitol far more and this was just another routine process. Most of all I hated that you just stopped. You stopped talking to me, aside from the rare curt comment or question about our tributes. You stopped trying to make the pain go away, and you quit tethering me to the real world. God, I hated everything that you did do and

He sat her on his bed and got her a glass of water. He stood next to her as she took a couple sips of water, until Frohike announced the police had arrived. After he gently touched her shoulder, he went to speak with the officers. Krycek watched the scene at the motel from some bushes on the side, where he had been since his escape from Scully""s room just moments before the Gunmen entered. He watched as Mulder, Scully, and The Gunmen talked and, obviously, agonized over what action to be taken, until the door shut. When the police arrived, he turned away from the motel and headed to his car parked a few blocks away. Scully lay awake in Mulder""s room, replaying the events of the day. Eric lay in the other bed. After the police left, Mulder had insisted that they switch rooms. He""d sleep in her room, in the OTHER bed. The Gunmen had managed to get a room next door to Mulder""s. She tried to synthesize all the information Dr. Stewart had given them. Trying to reconcile that with what Mulder and the Landrys had told her about Eric was nearly impossible. She thought about the Landrys... She heard a door close, pulling her out of her

This would be a new person altogether. Different DNA, just as if it had been conceived the conventional way."" The doctor paused. ""But?"" proded Krycek, getting angrier by the second. ""But it""s not the conventional way...we developed a way to simulate conception, using an artificial egg made in our laboratories. I could give you the science behind that but it would take awhile and I get the impression your in a hurry...Anyway, we still needed sperm because we haven""t found the technology advanced enough for what that would take...then we use a surrogate to carry the baby to term.

You know, first time experiment, there wasn""t much hope put into it. Amazing really."" Krycek stepped forward pushing the gun roughly against the other man""s chest. ""Where is he?"" ""Can I ask what your interst is in this experiment?"" The doctor was bold. It wasn""t generally a good idea to mess with the crazy man holding the gun. But Krycek didn""t answer, just stared.

622,"Text1: They only had two pictures of themselves that first day that they were married. One was of my mother in a nice blue dress with my father in a gray shabby suit holding her hand; my mother was holding wild daisies in the other hand and looking up at my father and not the camera, my dad was smiling worriedly at the camera. The other was of them wearing the same clothes, only kissing one another on the lips. Both of those pictures were the only memories they had of Russia to hold onto; I can see why they kept them all those years. Better to keep happy memories. My mother always was quiet and nervous, but loving. She always was over-worried about me; making sure that I was careful, making me wear a cloth scapular underneath my shirt, and praying for me all the time. I never understood her in that respect, although I""m pretty sure that she believed that Mariya""s death was her fault-because she left Russia. She didn""t want her only son to die also. My father, on the other hand, was foreign to me. He looked tough on the outside---he was tough on the outside. He was working, trying to get a jump on Capitalism, the Eighth Wonder of the World to him. Too bad that capitalistic madness gave him little money and a lot of ulcers. America was pretty cruel to her working class, especially the ones with the most desire to gain the upper hand. In Russia, he was a foreman of a small construction business, in America; he was a struggling carpenter, doing odd jobs. He had a degree in architecture, but he was working on tightening screws for people who were too lazy to it themselves. I struggled with him to teach

623,"Text1: ****************** Scully had disappeared into her bedroom while Mulder arranged the couch. He piled several pillows and dragged it to the middle of the room, into the better light. His leather sketchbook and tools were lying on a table. He spread out the cloth holder and removed a thin piece of lead. As he was scraping it for precision, the door to Scully""s bedroom opened. She was standing there in a gold and black kimono robe, holding her hands modestly over her breasts. The butterfly clips holding her hair had been removed, allowing it to fall freely down her back. A serious and determined look was on her face as she leaned against the doorway. Mulder was speechless, simply staring at her. Scully took a deep breath. This was the moment of truth. She was going to reveal herself completely to Mulder, bear her deepest emotions. For a long time this was incomprehensible, but today everything had changed. She was ready now, and she truly believed if anyone could capture her soul on paper, it was Mulder. He knew her better than anyone else in the world--in this world and in 1999. In every world where they were together, he would be her true soulmate. ""The last thing I need is a picture of me looking like a porcelain doll,"" Scully smiled coyly and stepped closer, the light illuminating her features even more. ""And as a paying customer,"" she tossed a dime into his lap, eliciting a grin from him, ""I expect to get what I want."" Scully stepped back and took a deep breath, her heart pounding mercilessly. She slowly and carefully removed the robe, allowing it to fall off of her body and onto the floor. It was done. There was no turning back now. Mulder was so

Text2: Scully turned back towards land. Mulder was getting further away, and she could see him stagger on the icy surface. The rope she held was slimy and wet, making it hard to keep a tight grasp, and she clawed at it desperately, trying to wrap it around her wrists but the snow made it difficult to stand and when she lost her footing suddenly the rope whipped away from her, snaking back into the grey water. The sudden backwards momentum pushed the little boat further away from the shore, her father simply stared forwards, still and silent. Scully felt her heart thumping against her ribs, and with a desperate whimper she shouted, almost yelped, ""William!' across the dead air. The name was the only word in her mind, and at that moment she wasn""t sure who she called it out for, the tiny baby who was a stranger to her and yet she felt powerfully certain his own name was ""William"", her father Bill or the her new partner, Fox William Mulder. The little boat shrank from view, the grey water appearing thick and heavy like wallpaper paste, peeling back in lazy waves to let the boat slide through it. On the whisper of a breeze she heard the thin, plaintive crying of a baby and felt her heart vibrate with an ache so strong the breath was pulled from her lungs and tears stung the corners of her eyes. She turned away from the beach, and almost on all-fours, clawed her way across the freezing landscape towards the tiny, stooped figure of her new partner. Scully jumped, a sensation of falling made her grab for the bed, there was a flash, a crackling, her eyes jolted open just as the room she found herself awake in was thrown into","{""output"": ""NO""}"

""Wait!"" Attila said, watching her arrow thud into a hissing Creeper, knocking it back a metre or so. ""See?"" she smirked. ""I probably just saved the camp from a creeper."" ""What?"" Eris said, confused. Then she turned and saw the Creeper, now totally ignoring the camp, with a wound in its leg. ""Oh right,"" she snapped. Tossing her hair over her shoulder, she headed down into the growing mineshaft. Attila squinted after her, tossing mental insults like stones against her retreating back. By midafternoon, the travellers had almost made it safely to Terrorvale after gathering some iron, so now Attila had an iron sword and pickaxe, what Ethan called the two most important tools in Minecraftia. She swung her sword experimentally, and was taken aback by how light it was. She hated how the sword felt like it was going to slide right out of her hand, but it was much, much lighter than she had expected to be. It was almost like the wooden sword, but more powerful. ""Hey guys, I see Terrorvale ahead,"" Hugo shouted to the others, striding ahead like usual.

Apparently, the kiss had tapped into a whole wealth of forbidden feelings - and while part of her screamed at her to stop while she still could, another part of her liked the danger of it. Not just because it was terribly wrong on many levels, personal and professional, but because it was something she couldn""t control. She was tired of being in control, of the constant throb in her lower back at the strain of her severe posture, of the ache in her jaw from keeping a straight face.

Arthur stood beside her in front of the cabinet and looked at the tea. ""What about green tea?"" He asked. ""Alright, green tea it is."" Olivia said with a tiny smile as she retrieved the box from the cabinet. ""How did you sleep? Are you adjusting well?"" Arthur asked as the two waited for the tea to finish. Olivia nodded. ""I...hopefully I""ll be used to this soon."" She said. ""Good. Well, once Alice and Victoria leave, it""ll get quiet around here."" Arthur said, leaning against the counter. Olivia laughed and Arthur chuckled. ""Well, Victoria""s not that bad...I don""t mind either of them, actually."" Olivia said with a smile. She crossed her arms and held them over her chest and held them there. Arthur shrugged. ""Alice is...at least a little bit more behaved than Victoria.

""Blame Beckett,"" Artemis stated simply, which was unusual for him, though he did utilize some rather wonderful alliteration. ""And why should I do that, Arty?"" the bodyguard beamed. ""Do not call me that,"" he reprimanded, his voice suddenly sharp. ""Right, I forgot,"" came the giggling reply, ""only your mother and girlfriend are allowed to call you that."" ""You""re speaking nonsense, Juliet,"" Artemis sighed. ""Holly refers to me by that nickname."" ""My point exactly - after all, much madness is divinest sense."" ""You read Emily Dickinson?"" ""Well, yeah."" Juliet shrugged. ""She has good poems."" ""Holly,"" Artemis turned to the elf in question, ""it appears that all our efforts to protect this world have come to naught."" ""Why?"" she inquired, noting that his fingers were now a mere centimeter away from her hip. He leaned closer to her, his fingers ghosting across her hip, and stage-whispered, ""The apocalypse has come - Juliet reads poetry."" ""The horror,"" she replied, her voice nearly hushed, her eyes shining with contained laughter. ""I can hear you, you know,"" Juliet drawled. ""As much fun as it is to watch you flirt, I will not allow myself to be mocked in the process."" ""Methinks the lady doth protest too much,"" Holly murmured, causing Artemis to crack a smile. ""Indeed,"" he concurred, getting to his feet and brushing nonexistent dust from his trousers. He then - due to the tiny bit of Orion screaming at him from the deepest recess of his brain - offered his hand to Holly, to help her down.

They quickly got rid of me, saying that since I was ""a big boy of six, after all,"" I could walk myself. Once down there, I jumped from rock to rock, singing tunelessly. It was then that I noticed a girl down at the end of the pier. She looked to be about my age, but smaller and thinner than me. *Girl""s P. O.

He must be cold, but he""s wearing a jumper, while I was fine in my swimsuit. ""Thalutationth!"" I called, quoting Charlotte, a spider in one of my favorite books. ""What?"" He had come up to me at this point, and appeared to be wondering if he should sit down, next to me. I scooted over to make room for him, so he plopped down on the rock, getting his pants wet from the spray. ""Thal-u-ta-tionth,"" I annunciated slowly, ""ith another word for hi.""

I think that this swimsuit would look much cuter on Haru-chan."" He pointed at a little sailor one piece on a stand. ""Tsk, tsk, tsk. I don""t think you get it, Hunny-senpai,"" the twins said to the little senior. Hunny looked confused.

She watched him put it on his pocket, and she narrowed her eyes as she tried to breath. ""You...brought that...?"" His eyes met hers. The wall was suddenly broken down, and Wrath charged Edward once again. The two went sailing through the window. Lust frowned as she followed, landing before the two as they struggled once again. Edward was flung off of Wrath and sent skidding down the dark alleyway. Lust stood in front of him, barring her knives and pointing them at the homunculus. His shoulders quivered in anger. ""TRAITOR!"" He screamed, as he made his way to her. Lust batted him away, making him fall back again. ""Traitor, traitor traitor!"" Wrath cried as he ran to her again, she easily avoided him, then went to strike. Wrath smiled, then help up the locket she had seen Edward put in his pocket. Her body was frozen again and she fell backwards, frozen in place. ""Dammit!"" Edward hissed, probably realizing that while in their struggle, Wrath had swiped the locket off him. ""You just couldn""t be patient, could you?"" The boy asked as he made his way to her stiff body. Wrath put his foot down on her chest and smiled darkly. ""Didn""t she already say she""d make us into humans if we found the Philosophers Stone for her?"" She did not recognize this boy. He couldn""t possibly be the Wrath she had known...

Stopping, the woman looked down at a crown of vibrant red hair. He was rather small, frailer than the other boys and his face was fair. Peering over the top of his head, she saw he had his small hands in his lap, and he was twiddling his thumbs quite nervously. ""Stop that fidgeting."" She hissed, and the red haired boy shuddered, sitting up straight and stopping the movement of his fingers. The other children suppressed giggles, and she glared at them. They managed to silence themselves, but the amusement didn""t leave their eyes as they watched the red haired boy flinch. Moving to stand before him, the tall, elderly reaper glanced down at the boy""s desk. He kept his face down cast, staring at his lap as she glanced over his open schoolbook. His handwriting was neat and tidy, and everything seemed to be in order. But she noticed something poking out from under his books. She cleared her throat, ""Sutcliff, would you care to show me what you are hiding?"" She pushed up her black, cat rimmed glasses, and her yellow green eyes narrowed as she watched him gulp. The boy hesitated, obviously not wanting to show the woman what he was hiding beneath his books. She began to tap her foot impatiently, and he cleared his throat before answering, ""Y-yes ma""am.""

Zane had shooed the rest of us on, staying behind in the training center as he called for Amethyst Dann, the girl he just so happened to despise when he would speak to me and ignore the rest of his allies. At first, I had believed it was an apology he wanted to share with Amethyst, but I""ve known Zane for so many years, despite his four full years ahead of me, and Zane never muttered anything of respect. It""s too perplexing, though, as Zane was raised to be respectful and determined by his strict parents. But it never seemed to show. Since they""re talk, Amethyst certainly displayed no interest in Zane, excluding him from anything that came out of her mouth. And, unless provoked or insulted, Zane did not mind, treating Amethyst the same. They often say that such actions reveal love, but if this was an act of flirtation between the two, it was a rather sick way of showing feelings.

He was so lost in thoughts of her that he barely registered the bell ringing until Gale nudged him. They headed into their physics class silently walking side by side in long strides, neither paying attention as girls sighed at the sight of them. Thom dreaded physics. He considered physics to be math disguised as science, but last year the diocese had decided to make it a requirement to graduate because apparently it looked really good to colleges to have four years of science opposed to just three. Thom walked in behind Gale and almost stopped in his tracks when he saw Delly Cartwright talking to the teacher, Ms. Trinket. Flashbacks of his dream came flooding into his mind, from her breathy pants, to the sway of her hips, to how her hair felt as he dragged his fingers through the curls. But he forced himself to keep walking to his desk. By the time he looked up, Delly was gone and Ms. Trinket was looking through some papers on her desk. She found one slip and seemed distraught. She looked up and saw Thom watching her. ""Oh, Thom! Do you think you could run after Delly and give her this form? She should be on her way to the office to turn in the travel permission slips, but I just found Glimmer""s. Please."" Oh yeah, Thom forgot Ms. Trinket was the cheerleading sponsor.

""I can""t understand it, Mulder. I""ve never had nightmares like this, not even after Barry and Pfaster. Why was the Schnauz case so different?"" ""Maybe because, Schnauz was going to erase your memory and Barry just gave you to the aliens, and Pfaster just wanted to kill you.""

""Again, never would have pinned you as a sweet romantic enjoying person."" ""Shhh."" Two hours later.. The movie had ended, but Mulder couldn""t bear to move. Scully had fallen asleep with her head on his shoulder, and the smell of her hair was intoxicating. He reached for the remote, trying not to disturb the person snuggled tightly into his shoulder. Mulder turned down the TV and put the news on, hoping to lull himself into sleep. Instead, Scully began to wake up. She moved her head dazedly off his shoulder and looked at him sideways.\ ""Mulder, what time is it?"" ""Three am."" Scully groaned. ""I really don""t feel like driving home.

He got onto his feet at once and belatedly realized that he had left his Durandel with Penelo, thinking that to bring a sword would only get in his way. All that he had with him now was a small platinum dagger, her gift for his birthday last year. He pulled it out on instinct and crossed it defensively in front of his chest, at the same time as the queen spoke again. ""Wait, he is a friend of mine,"" she said quickly, drawing the attention of her guards away from him. Vaan waited, his dagger still poised before him, as they digested this information slowly. ""Are you certain, Your Majesty?"" One of them finally asked. Suspicion had not left their face and their swords were still pointed at him, a fact which Vaan was painfully aware of. ""Yes, Riban,"" she assured him with a firm nod, ""and thank you. You and Ergar may return to your post."" Reluctantly they did as were told. It was not until the door had been closed behind them that she let her eyes to search for him again. Instead of a smile, there was a frown on her face and Vaan could already feel his spirit diminishing at the sight. ""I never thought you would pay me a visit tonight,"" she said, her voice the mirror of calmness. That was when Vaan realized that he was still flaunting his dagger and accordingly slipped it back into its sheathe. ""I""m sorry,"" he said, uneasiness slipping into his voice even if he tried to keep it away. ""I thought you""d come in alone."" To his relief, Ashe gave him a little smile.

It could be all those long years watching the world unfolding through the other boy""s eyes, loving and hating the fact that a part of him was still able to enjoy many small fragments of happiness the rest had forfeited. His consolation, but also his own personal hell. The most vivid that Syaoran remembered was that he had spent every drawn breath trying to fortify his heart, because as much as it ached when he felt his clone smiling or laughing, this was the person he might have to kill once he had broken out of his confines. Pity wasn""t something he could afford, affection even less, but he didn""t really have any choice. All he could do was hope, that he would win the gamble, that his other self would be able to escape the tangled web of pain and betrayal fate had wound around him. That Sakura wouldn""t have to lose her smile. But he had lost. His clone surrendered to his fate, leaving the princess begging and crying at his feet, and despite everything Syaoran had done to arm himself against that kind of situation, it still hurt him. Immensely. And then, of course, came the kiss. The intolerable, frustratingly inexplainable kiss, which regardless of the manner of its execution, had been his first, ever. Syaoran wasn""t exactly a romantic person - what chance did he have with romanticism anyway, after having practically no contact with anyone or anything but bubbling liquid for years.

This threw Ritsu off guard, ""Well, she wore a blue, furisode kimono with bird-of-paradise flowers, and her eyes were blue and green at the same time, like the sea."" Ritsu envisioned his beautiful fairy with the ocean eyes. He recounted the melody she played that would break the heart of even the most heartless.

I suspect after I showed no signs of it hurting, his hand went a bit more heavy. This time he took the time to look the designs over and felt along the smooth length. Circling his fingers around my wrist, he turned the arm side to side, getting a better look. Then he did the same to the left arm, his eyes sweeping over everything.

Text2: After a while they begin to talk about their lives. Haymitch tells her about his mother and his younger brother, how he""s going to go down into the mines to support them as soon as he""s eighteen and how he wishes he could""ve started sooner. He even finds himself telling her about how his father went off illegally into the woods when Haymitch was ten and was found two days later hanging from a tree with a rope around his neck. Julia""s family life is nowhere near as dramatic-both of her parents are still alive, her father is a miner and her mother is a laundress, and she""s the oldest of five siblings, her youngest sister being just six months old. Julia speaks in a quiet voice as they don""t really dance, just sway, and gasps and widens her eyes at the appropriate times in his story. Haymitch likes her Seam eyes. They""re the color of clouds on a slightly rainy day, but he can see a hint of orange around her pupil in her right eye. He""s not usually one to talk unless he""s insulting somebody, but something about her loosens his tongue. The party ends and Haymitch decides that the polite thing to do would be to walk Julia home. She lives in a dilapidated Seam hovel nearly identical to his save for the laundry line with the clothing of rich people and Peacekeepers hanging from it and the sow slumbering near her doorway. ""Thank you,"" she says, her face turning a bright red. ""No one""s ever asked me to dance with them before.""

But, that was part of his charm. ""You should take a hint from your senpai and be more cheerful,"" I said to the twins. They glared at me and sat in the grass. This was normal and not scary at all, considering I was older and more mature, if I do say so myself. However, when I got daggers sent to me by Kyoya, I felt a bit scared for my life. ""Let""s play catch, Tama-chan!"" the small blonde boy begged. Mori walked across the field to have his own area. I smiled and took the frisbee out of the bag. I threw it towards the smaller senpai would had to jump high to catch it. His karate spirit really showed when he did a spinning kick in the air and threw the disc to Mori-senpai before returning to the ground. The taller boy caught it one-handed without even looking at it. Whenever he does cool stuff like that, I wonder if he""s secretly an alien ninja or something. He swung his arm and released the frisbee, making it fly in my direction. Since I""ve never taken any form of martial arts, my jump was pitiful and the disc continued to glide in the air over my head and behind me. ""I""ll get it!"" I said once it landed on a hill behind me. I turned on my heel and dashed for the hill. The disc was pretty far, considering how hard the throw was. It was on the very top and away from my friends. The frisbee was next to a large oak tree that leaned far too close to the ground

Text2: ""Woah..."" fell off his lips in a moment of speechlessness and Victor smirked at how mesmerized he made the boy. He pushed forward through the calm night waves with his human companion holding onto his wrist beside him. They passed rocks covered in moss and beaten from erosion where families of sea creatures lived peacefully until they were brought up to a large cave-like structure further in. ""This is where I live,"" Victor pointed out. The cave was surrounded by coral of all colors to match Victor""s colorful personality. Some plants seemed to glow like a solar-powered nightlight that gave the cave a mystical feeling (not that being underwater without drowning wasn""t mystical in itself). Before Yuuri could finish admiring the scenery, a small figure swam out from the inside of the cave. ""Victor! You""re finally back. What the fuck took you so lo- what the hell?!"" The human blinked at the new presence of another half-man-half-fish. This one looked smaller than even him with the build of a high schooler with long blonde hair that reminded Yuuri of Victor during their first encounter as kids. His hair was tied to the side in a braid with a thin strip of seaweed to show the distasteful look on his face. His tail was smaller than Victor""s and had a striking blood red color to it. His tail almost matched his face as the boy yelled aggressively at the two. ""Did you fucking bring a human here?! Are you insane?! Yakov is going to murder you!"" he yelled. ""Yuuri, this is Yurio.

Text2: Damned if he did, but all Bel could think of as they exited the Cadillac was to slice the smirk the raven-haired bastard to Fran""s side was wearing. What right did they hold, to go to their home like so? Who were they, to believe they could intrude into their pedestrian lives without repercussions? Why and how did they even know the location of their abode? Yet not one question fully registered in the blond""s mind. He simply wanted to get his knife out and sculpt a new mouth on the unwelcome visitor""s face. He wanted to pry those filthy hands off what he considered - knew - was his. Furthermore, it only enraged him doubly when Fran continued to stand there, nonchalantly, as if nothing was wrong. As if they had not just tread into their lives abruptly. As if he had done nothing wrong worth repenting for. Squalo had taken it upon himself to situate himself up front - mere feet from them - should the need for an intervention from him arise. And by the eerie silence and lack of silvery mirth from his younger brother, it was clear it would be necessary. Despite his growing need to beat the two unwelcome guests to a bloody pulp, and use it to paint over the chipped parts of his car. ""Is that the boy you told me about before, Fran?"" The eldest abruptly inquired, tone beyond bemused. Bel""s grip on the sling of his bag tightened to the point the garage smelled faintly of copper. Pointing to the infuriated blond casually, the aqua-haired youth replied, ""His name is Belphegor-senpai, shushou. How many times must I say this?"" A morbid grin cracked his condescending features, and after a playful pinch to the younger, the raven-haired man answered: ""Until you","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""Oh no,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. She whirled up through the towers of mosaics where tubes of teeth were held to a certain container in the furthest tower. A baby popped it out and handed it to her, the picture of a young girl with red pigtails and a gape-toothed smile. The picture began to fade. ""Jill,"" she murmured, sadness inking her voice.

Edmund walked up next to the den after her, looking at his uncle. ""Shall I start making soup? Aunt Alberta""s on her way home."" Her uncle still didn""t reply as she came into the den. She looked at him, getting increasingly tired of how her uncle paid more attention to the paper he read, ""Uncle Harold."" He still said nothing, folding the paper so he could keep reading it.

Leanne clenched her teeth, and looked ready to charge, but Jaga still held her back, a little surprised at the protectiveness she had for Lion-O, whom she just met yesterday. Claudus brought the sword down into the floor, into the middle of the ThunderCats emblem, powerful bolts flying from the blade. Once they had stopped, Lion-O got up and grabbed the hilt of the sword, pulling it out from the floor.

It starts before the beginning of Blackrock and is told mostly from Zoey""s point of view in 3rd person, rated T due to violence and gore near the end. I do not own any of the characters. Pretty short chapter to start of, enjoy! :3 Chapter 1 - A fresh start. A second chance, a fresh start. It""s what Zoey wanted, and now she""s got it. The only problem is that meant being the new girl all over again. It is very imported to make a good first impression, and she had never been very good at those. Starting a new school, it was a hard mission, properly the hardest Barry had ever given her, but it was the one she was most determined to make a success. She turned around the corner and the school came into sight. Mission: Fresh Start - commence. The school was relatively large for the small sea side town in which it was located. Children

That she would let exploit it if she gave in all the way. The Korean dropped her panties to the cold floor, Scully was bare under her skirt now. He began kissing up her thigh. ""That doesn""t matter just this second...."" He reached her ass. ""Nothing matters but what happens in the next few minutes...."" The Korean parted her buttocks and his mouth locked against her aching opening, his tongue stretching its tight entrance and making Scully jerk on the hammock, clawing for support. As she felt his saliva lubricating her and awakening the traces of discomfort still left there, Scully tried to turn her head. ""What is going to happen?"" ""You know you don""t ask...""

Heavy with luggage, the plodded into the store to check in. The old man behind the desk, presumably the clerk, eyed them over and suggested ""How about the honeymoon suite?"" Scully blushed and turned away pretending to look at the leaflets on the rack next to the desk, so Mulder wouldn""t see her. Deep down, she hoped the answer to that question would be ""yes"" but not now....Scully sighed. ""Actually, separate cabins."" Mulder corrected, keeping his cool. Mulder didn""t see how the clerk could have mistook Scully and Mulder for a couple or even just married. They both wore business suits and dark expressions. Maybe the clerk thought they made a cute couple. ""Very well,"" the clerk replied shrugging ""Here""s cabin 1 and 2, you""re the only people here. The murders drove everyone away. I""m guessing now that you""re law enforcement. The murderer could be involved with the logging company that""s been in here."" The clerk gave Mulder and Scully their keys. ""Oh, sorry, we forgot to introduce ourselves."" Mulder apologized flashing his badge due to course of habit. ""Special agent Fox Mulder and this is my partner,"" ""Special agent Dana Scully."" Scully finished flashing her badge as well. ""Nice to meet you."" the clerk said ""We may need to question you later and thank you for your cooperation."" Mulder spilled out the jargon they taught you at Quantico making it sound original. He picked up his bag and started to walk out. ""Come on Scully.""

His car will be fine there until he gets back and if someone else pulls up, well, then they""ll have to deal and thank Stiles later for inadvertently saving their lives from killer ice patches. He grabs the groceries in their canvas bags out of the back seat, slings the straps over each of his shoulders and begins walking. It ""s marginally more difficult that he would""ve liked, trying to avoid the ice patches, but he keeps himself motiviated by chanting ""don""t break the eggs, she""ll fucking kill you if you break the eggs"" and that""s probably totally true.

Text2: Bright moonlight shown down on our camp as a cloud floated away. I felt a strange calm inside me as I stared, dazed by the light. Suddenly, I realized I felt a strange tingling sensation in my feet. I tried to ignore it, but it crawled up my legs, and into my arms. I knew what was happening, and it wasn""t lack of blood circulation. I quietly slipped out of my sleeping bag and tiptoed away from the camp. I didn""t stop until I reached a large river. A few stones lay on the bank, and the water slowly flowed down a slope. I took off my shirt, and my pants, folding them neatly and placed them on one of the stones. I dipped my toe into the water and shivered. Slowly, I became used to the cold and walked into the river until it was deep enough to swim in. I ducked my head under for a moment, relishing in the relaxing, cool feeling. For a while I floated gently around, but swam back towards my clothes to make sure I didn""t get lost downstream. Then it hit me. A painful shock in my arm, just as it had a couple of days before. This time, I shoved my face underwater to muffle my cry of pain. I felt both my arms become tight, and my legs unintentionally bent. I desperately tried to swim to the shore, and succeeded in grabbing hold of the bank to haul myself out of the water. Slowly, and painfully my back felt crushed, and the breath was driven out of me. Brown fur began sprouting from my arms and legs, and white fur grew from my chest and neck. I clenched and unclenched my hands into fists, gritting my teeth in pain. My","{""output"": ""NO""}"

Russell blushed at this and glanced down at Lumpy""s dripping member before continuing. Lumpy moaned as he was taken in all the way, his shaft receiving a wonderful massage by that skilled mouth. He grabbed a handful of Russell""s hair and thrusted upwards. Russell""s eyes widened before his head was grabbed on each side, and Lumpy""s member was forced down his throat. He moaned and tried to squirm out of the bluenette""s hold, but Lumpy was so high off of bliss that he could barely notice that he was gagging Russell. He thrusted faster until he came into the smaller male""s mouth with a loud moan. He glanced down at the bluenette and gave a worried look when he saw Russell with faint tears in his eyes and a mouthful of semen that he wasn""t able to swallow. He cupped one of his cheeks and kissed his forehead. ""Sorry."" Russell paused for a minute before swallowing. ""It""s alright."" He got off of Lumpy and kissed him gently. Lumpy pushed him back on the couch without breaking the kiss, spreading his legs wide and gently inserting a finger. Russell whimpered and gripped Lumpy""s shoulders as the digit slid deeper inside of him. ""L-Lumpy."" ""I know. Just relax."" Russell nodded and took in a breath as the taller bluenette inserted another finger before thrusting the two. Russell wrapped arms around him and pulled him in for another kiss to ease the pain.

Sorry if this chapter was short. That proves my brain is rotting from no ideas. Chapter 7 The clock on the wall had struck 1 am as Hikaru awoke with a jolt as he frantically sat up with wide eyes. He breathed heavily while grabbing a fistful of hair, shuddering from the nightmare he had witnessed. The older Hitachiin almost believed it was real, that something like this happened to him and his brother. He tightened his grip out of fear, his crimson eyes glowing as moonlight shone through the window. Losing Kaoru was his worst fear, Hell it was the only thing he was afraid of. If anything happened to his brother, it would cause him to go mad or commit suicide. The older twin heard a small moan, and turned to see Kaoru turn over, his head nuzzling into the pillow and his arm somewhat hanging over the edge of the bed. He let out a relieved sigh, but gave his brother a concerned look as the younger Hitachiin let out a small whimper of fear. He shifted a bit, and with the help of moonlight, Hikaru saw a pair of scars on his back. With a sigh, he ran a hand through his hair, remembering that he too also had those scars. In truth, all demons had wings once, both male and female, but the king was afraid of those wings being","{""output"": ""YES""}"

Her hand pressed against his, and she opened her own eyes, the pale orbs shining with hope. ""Toph..."" he breathed, before his eyes fluttered closed, and his arm went slack. He woke in his old bed, fresh bandages around his waist. He could feel Toph""s arms around him, and hear her soft singing. Her voice wavered softly as though she was on the verge of crying again. Zuko wrapped his arms around her, and her singing stopped with a gasp of his name he looked down at her and saw purplish marks on her arms. He pulled her arm straight, and looked down at the bruised handprint. He compared it to his own hand, but the bruise was too wide to be from him. ""Who did this?"" he asked with a hiss. ""One of the guards, he tried to pull me away from you, I wouldn""t go."" she answered. Zuko looked down at her again, and could see streaks on her face from her tears. ""You took down Azula by yourself?"" he asked. ""Yeah, I had my rage helping me along."" she said softly. ""You really scared me, I thought I was going to loose you."" ""Im sorry. You know that I would never leave you alone, but I came very close."" he whispered back to her. Toph tilted her head up, and kissed him softly, the kiss became deeper as Zuko tightened his embrace.

A soft sound outside drew his attention, but he didn""t stop, he waited patiently, continuing on. The door to his shop opened and two men walked inside, carrying something wrapped in white between them.

Even though he was being extremely quiet, he knew that he would get Levi""s attention. The older boy was a light sleeper, so even if Eren hadn""t knocked, he would have somehow sensed that he was awake and in the hall anyway. The door creaked open and the tired, slightly grouchy face of Levi appeared in the doorway. ""Eren? What are you doing up? Did you wet the bed again?"" he asked, trying not to let his irritation show for the younger""s sake. Eren took in a shaky breath, looking toward the ground to avoid eye-contact as he shook his head. ""Well what is it then?"" Tentatively, Eren lifted his face, looking up so that his eyes met his brother""s in the semi-darkness.

He knew that he should be doing something, he just didn""t know what. When Eren just stood there, crying silently, Levi resigned to take his arm and drag him into his room. It was pitch black in there, so Eren allowed himself to be dragged and plopped onto the bed. A second later, a lamp switched on and Eren could see the room perfectly, with Levi sitting right in front of him. The two of them continued to sit there for a while, Levi waiting for Eren to calm down before interrogating him. ""What happened?"" He finally asked.

She knew that she shouldn""t be whining or complaining about any of this, that there were other people in the world who have experienced far worse than she has, and thinking like this just made her angry with herself and her weaknesses. But sometimes she couldn""t hold back the dark, depressing thoughts always swirling in the back of her mind. Sometimes, the thoughts just came to the front, invading her consciousness and entrapping her within a dark, eternal void. There were times when it got so bad, that she couldn""t even bring herself to go out into the world. Like right now. Today was Friday, the last day of school for the week, and for some reason, Shino couldn""t bring herself to even get out of bed. Well, she knew why, she just didn""t fully understand why she still felt this way about any of it. ""Hey. Look who it is."" Shino""s head immediately snapped up, her stomach seeming to drop as she recognized the voice of a girl that went to her school. ""It""s our friend, Asada,"" another voice said from her right, and soon, Shino was surrounded. Without warning, hands shoved her into an alleyway, her back slamming against a wall. Several faces leered at her, their eyes cold and expressions sinister. ""What were you doing in such a nice shop like that, huh, Asada?"" The girl in question eyed them coldly, the afternoon sun setting a glare over her glasses as she wondered just how walking through the shopping district led to this. Keeping her expression blank and her tone flat despite the small prick of fear she felt inside, Shino retorted. ""Nothing that concerns you."" The others","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""Humans sure are weird sometimes,' Moonmon, meanwhile, was thoroughly amused by what she was hearing. ""Easy enough to answer,"" a voice from the other end of the room spoke loud enough for everyone to hear, and, when they turned around, they saw Yuki was the one who spoke. She was looking at her cell phone bored, but still somehow seemed like she overheard their conversation. ""He thought that we had sports today; guess he got the schedule wrong yesterday."" With this reasoning given she went back to her seat, and continued typing something on her phone. Cain sweat dropped, Why would she help me?But, seeing it as something he could work with, he played along with it. ""Haha, guess it looks like Yuki looked through me,"" he laughed and walked over to his seat next to her, stealing a glance at her cell phone. ""As I thought..."" he mumbled - noticing it looked nearly identical to his own - when he sat down, dropping his school bag and the sport bag on the floor; he forgot that Moonmon was in it. ""Ouch!"" She groaned, somehow keeping it low enough so as not to be heard. ""You will get that back later, boy! I swear you, and Gennai, will pay for today!'

She yawned and opened her door. Mulder exited the car and walked to the rear of the car. He opened the trunk and gathered the luggage that was inside of it. Mulder carried the luggage up to their hotel room. Scully opened the burgundy colored door. The interior of the hotel was quite nice compared to the dumps Mulder and Scully were used to staying at during their investigations. There were two beds, both covered with bedspreads with a blue and purple floral pattern. A small television set sat on top of the oak dresser. Scully sat on the edge of the bed and flipped through the channels of the television. Cartoons. Days of our Lives. Cops. Baseball. News. Tired of flipping the channels, Scully turned the television off and laid back on the bed. She watched Mulder as

Mulder looked at his two redheads, and his heart swelled again ""We made this perfect little thing, Scully, can you believe it?"" Scully chuckled through happy tears. It felt so good to laugh, to release the tension and fears of the last 9 months. She smoothed her thumb over the soft, velvety skin, leaned over and presses a kiss to a fuzzy little ear. ""Happy Birthday Fox"", Scully wished Mulder with a kiss on the forehead. ""Thank you, ... for giving me... the chance to be a father again. It""s the most beautiful gift I could ever dream for"", Mulder said honestly. He pressed his lips to her temple. ""I love you both so much,"" he whispered against her skin.

The words ""his girls"" still filled his heart with a joy he couldn""t believe possible and brought a goofy smile to his face. Scully smiled, watching as Mulder carefully transferred their sleeping daughter into the baby carrier without waking her. Mulder moved to pick up the carrier but was stopped in his tracks as Scully suddenly stepped in towards him and wrapped her arms around his torso, pressing her head into his chest.

Phryne reached for the note without a word, brows still pert enough to resist any action the man seemed to take, even as he turned away from her.

Since then, it had always just been her and her dad living in their small two-story home, now right beside a Krei Tech construction site. Andrew Huang was a bulk of a man and, being San Fransokyo""s Chief of Police, always wore and unintentional scowl. Andrew had to go out of the house that night, hearing about an illegal bot fight happening in his neighborhood.

Text2: Dakar, Senegal 1954 THROUGH the small rounded window, sunlight passed into the cabin as Erik prepared himself for a long, arduous 6 hour flight to Paris. He found a fresh lead on Schmidt that led him to a small town by the sea. A goose chase, quite possibly, but beggars can""t be choosers. Erik sighed as he surveyed the interior of the contraption that was to be his metaphorical, and quite possibly, literal, airborne coffin to France. It was one of the regular commercial planes with two passengers"" seats on either side of an isle in the center. Seats were covered in a dark velvet fabric, comfortably spaced in between each pair. A small semi-circular wooden counter was attached to the end of the aisle, where drinks will later on be served, with archways on either side of it, leading to the cockpit. The cabin itself had a dull beige color that complimented the overall interior design. Passengers were slowly filing in on either side, mostly white men, businessmen, he assumed, in their crisp gray suits being entertained by the airline""s stewardesses. One of which, he noticed, sent him a rather coquettish smile. He leafed through his in-flight pamphlet, completely ignoring the woman. He was a good looking man, above average at best, he knew. Erik wasn""t as thick as to pass by the looks the women sent him while in his travels. Naturally, with his talents, seduction was a game he played rather well: a little whisper here, a small touch there, all in good business and fun, he""d usually end up having his way.

It was only until I opened my lazy eyes that I noticed just who I was dealing with. Standing next to my bookshelf going through the titles was the hottest dead guy I""d ever seen. Seriously. He was tall, probably about 6 foot, and he was built. Not really big but not scrawny either. He had black hair that was a bit on the longer side, and the most perfect, gorgeous brown ey- I mean brown eyes. He wore faded black dress pants, black shoes, and a white button down shirt. His shirt was unbuttoned at the top so you could see a good deal of his finely chiseled chest, and the sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. He was the most gorgeous guy in the world, or the spectral world. He looked rather unabashed. ""Yea I was curious. I knew you could sense me. You""re the first human to see me in over 90 years.""

""Holy squid shit,"" I mumbled. It was huge, reaching up to 150 blocks up. It was made of dark spruce wood, making it look like a Skyhub hidden in the shadows of the storm clouds. There were two small rooms near the from of the Skyhub with another one at the back. The main room was in the center, a trapdoor separating it from the outside. Though they were hidden, I knew from experience that there was an extra floor above the main room, then two huge watch towers connected only by wooden columns leading up by ladders. I only knew part of this stuff because Sky showed me Skyhub 3.0. Come to think of it, the Skyhub 2013 look exactly like Skyhub 3.0.

I was the first to go up, willing my frozen hands to close around the wooden rungs and pull my body weight up. Jerome followed next, along with Ck and Blabid.

I realize my hair isn""t brushed, I""m wearing my pajamas, and I""m completely tense. I shake my head and silently sip my water. I sit at breakfast for ten minutes like this until I see Peeta walk down the hallway. Effie stops eating and looks up at him, ""Your late."" She says as she glares at him. I didn""t care about what Effie had said, I just cared that he was there. I flew out of my seat and ran over to him. I wrapped my arms around his waist and I could feel all eyes in the room on us, even the avoxes. Peeta seems a little shocked but still carefully puts his arms around me. He whispers in my ear, ""Katniss I was just in the shower, don""t worry."" I give a slight nod and let go of his waist but quickly grab his hand instead. I didn""t leave Peeta""s side for the rest of the day. After dinner I need to take a shower but still refused to have him near so I took a shower in his room. I undressed leisurely and stepped into the shower. I push some of the buttons on the wall that selected a light setting for the water and an assortment lavender smelling soaps, shampoos, and conditioners. The warm water was relaxing and seemed to calm me a bit. As I stepped out of the shower and a realization hits me... I don""t have anything to change into.

I asked. ""Yeah?"" ""Thank you."" I said slowly closing my eyes and resting. A snap of a branch and a blood curdling scream was all I heard before I woke up. I looked around for Celeste. ""Celeste!"" I screamed. I got down from the tree and saw her lying on the ground. Her back was misshaped and she had blood coming out of her mouth. ""Celeste!"" I yelled running to her aid. I looked up from where she was. She must have fallen from the tree. Her hand slowly, shaking, slid across her body and to her side. When she showed me her hand, there was a tremendous amount of blood. The grass had turned red and she was shaking. I held onto her hand and started crying. ""I""m so sorry. I""m so so sorry.""

But after the war, the Kou Empire proposed an eternal truce with the Seven Seas Alliance on the condition that King Sinbad would marry a princess of Kou. Her fragile heart broke when Ren Hakuei was married to a reluctant Sinbad two weeks later. She had despaired in her little corner as she watched the only man she thought she""d ever love marry the woman she had always wanted to be. But what broke her out of her reverie was the emperor of the Kou Empire, her respected brother Ren Kouen himself. He had found her wallowing in a dark corner of the garden and told her the truth. Ren Hakuei had sacrificed herself in her sister""s place. ""He may never hurt you but, nonetheless, he will make you miserable. Hakuei told me that your greatest wish was for love. If that""s the case, my dear youngest sister, Sinbad is not the man I would give you to,"" she had cried over Sinbad for the last time that night and the next month, she was sent to Balbadd as Kou""s official ambassador to what was just being built as the continent""s greatest trade city. It was amazing that she had been there all throughout Morgiana and Alibaba""s two year relationship and now, she was marrying the man from the very couple which had inspired her to believe in finding her true love and the woman was the first to congratulate her and her fiancé when they broke the news of their impending nuptials.

Despite his knack for driving her mad, she had constantly felt as if they were only moments away from starting something very untoward. The call to U Penn had dropped as she was holding the door open for the students, and she had only just suppressed the urge to scream. The studio itself hadn""t been bad. The students had worked without consulting her for most of the six hour block, which had allowed her to pen a nasty e-mail to Haymit-Professor Abernathy. As she is leaving, a sullen-looking young woman stops her, trailed by the always pleasant Mr Mellark. ""You need to get me a letter of reference today,"" the student demands. Katniss Everdeen, her brain supplies. Brutal designs, really. But Hay-Professor Abernathy is sure that she is some kind of genius. ""Excuse me,"" Effie says, stepping closer to the girl. Katniss Everdeen is no match for her. Effie is nearly six foot in heels and isn""t wearing some ironic hipster sweater that looks to have been poorly patched. ""What she, excuse me, what she means to say is that Professor Abernathy promised us recommendations two months ago and still hasn""t, um, let us know they were sent.

He whispers, and I can already see him racking his brain for the most fantastic meal he can imagine. ""Thank you."" I respond gently. Then I allow him to barricade himself in the kitchen while I wait. And, as luck has it, Peeta never disappoints. The smell hits my nose before I even know he""s beside me.

Hot chocolate, and even a whole bowl of the stuff, melted, that I remember eating with Cinna. And, behind the feast of his creation, Peeta. A towel flung over his shoulder, slightly exhausted, but completely overjoyed by his work. I have no idea how he found the time to compose all this. Perhaps he knew a few of the recipes, but I sure for the most part he was cooking from memory. It doesn""t matter. I am astounded. ""Peeta-"" I start, trying to sit up; but I find myself wincing.

And in the recent two weeks, I had barely managed to spend any time with Jesse. Neither of us was in the mood to get out of the house nowadays, so we were basically spending our days staying home - watching videos, popping endless packs of popcorn, playing a few board games now and then and making out a lot. Not that I minded (LOL)! Surprisingly, Jesse is getting a bit bolder nowadays. He slips his hand into my bra quite often, without getting all guilty and awkward, like he used to before (he doesn""t quite feel me up through the front - it""s mostly at the back - but he""s done it a couple of times). I guess he""s finally realized that we""re engaged. But he still refuses to go all the way before the wedding night. But I""ve kind of stopped caring much. It was just one more day. And at least Jesse wouldn""t fuss then. But still, second base is an okay consolation. Right now, we were making out on the bed of Jesse""s room. Jesse always forgets to lock the door when he goes into his room to change. I knew this, so I had slunk into his room quietly and shut the door quietly. He was preparing to put his shirt on. I crept up behind him and slipped my arms around his bare stomach. ""Susannah!"" he turned around, shocked. I laughed. I did this so often, and Jesse still never anticipated it. When he looked at me, he didn""t take as much time as he usually does

Mulder glanced up at Scully, who was still examining the victim, and then back at the bunch of flowers. The small one he had given her was still very much intact the last time he had seen it at the motel. How could the one that had been safely kept in a bag have disintegrated so quickly? He guessed it probably wasn""t important, and yet he just had to know... ""Is there anything there that can be analysed?"" ""There is a petal--"" Reaching for one of the flowers in front of him, Mulder gave a slight nod and stared at it. ""Is it possible that it""s from a rose?"" he asked directly. Scully tore her eyes away from the ones that were staring back at her from the tree and frowned with confusion at her partner. ""The shape is similar, but it""s much too small and - apart from the fact that they do not flower this time of year - I was told you picked this from a tree.""

When he felt that happen, he looked me in the eyes and smiled. A true, genuine smile. Then he traced his fingers over my breasts, massaging them - only, this was the best damn massage I""ve ever had. Then he bent his head down and kissed each one twice. After he saw the delight that this caused me, he began sucking on them. The sensation he was causing on my skin was so unbelievably . . . indescribable. I just - it was awesome. When he was done with that, he spoke. ""You""re . . . different than I remember,"" he said, his voice sounding odd. I wanted to scream, ""HELLO! I had two kids, courtesy of YOU. Of COURSE my body is different!""

The idea wormed its way through her brain, insinuating itself into areas of conscious thought. By the next morning she made up her mind. For better or worse, the cat could stay. * * * The god lay on the woman""s bed exhausted but extremely pleased. It had taken an awful amount of energy, but she had finally gotten through to her human. Before long, she would be able to concentrate her efforts on the second phase of the project. She fell into a deep sleep that did not break when the woman returned many hours later. The god remained curled in a tight ball all the while the woman pulled out clothes and packed them into a bag. While Bastet slumbered on, the woman called her mother. ""Could you come by and check on the cat while I""m gone? ...Maybe. We""ll see....Can you get her some food? And whatever else she""ll need? I won""t have a chance before I leave....Love you too, Mom. I""ll see you when I get back."" Despite being fast asleep, the god heard this and a smug smile formed on her feline lips. * * * Like a cat stalking its prey, the god had seen potential in the woman from the first and went after it single- mindedly. Concentrating on one thing to the exclusion of all else was one of her strengths. What Bastet lacked, however, was far-sightedness. For cats, there is only now, not next week, or even tomorrow. The god was not as limited in her scope as a cat, but she had spent too many lifetimes in a feline shape not to pick up a feline point of view.

Text2: Her heart jumped into her throat as she realized he was leaning too. Their faces were suddenly inches apart, and she hesitated there, relishing his nearness. She didn""t know where it was going to go from here, as the moment was suspended; whether they would meet for a long-anticipated kiss or if he would pull away and make some excuse for the magic of the moment, as it dissipated forever. Time resumed abruptly, and his mouth met hers. It was so inappropriate, but so wonderful that even her scientific mind could raise no argument sufficient to make her stop. She pushed into his kisses, wondering when he would panic and pull away, wondering when she would come to her senses and attempt to pretend this kiss never happened. But the moment never came. Even as they broke to take a breath no words were spoken, and she observed no reluctance to resuming on his part. Some invisible wall between them had shattered and she wondered if they would ever be able to erect it again, or if instead it would always be a teetering stack of pieces, waiting for but the slightest vibration to crash down again. His fingers ran through her hair and coherent thought melted away. Why would she spend this precious moment questioning what would happen when it had gone away? Instead, she threw herself into the sensation of his mouth on hers, of his fingers in his hair, of the fine stubble that coated his cheeks. If she could, she would make this moment last forever, because she hadn""t realized until it was upon her that this is what her heart had yearned for for the past six years.

Enzan, who has never been good with handling these sort of awkward situations to begin with, smashes his lips with Netto""s in a vain attempt to get a response.

Derek bared his teeth, his eyes locked on the boy in front of him. ""I told you, the coach split us up into pairs."" Stiles shrugged. ""And I don""t have to justify myself to you.

""Like that one!"" she cheered. Before I was even able to turn around she pulled me into the portal and I was immediately surrounded with a purple light that seared my skin and was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life. I couldn""t help but scream in absolute agony as my insides were set alight and burned. I vaguely heard Lime""s voice as she cried out my name, but the only thing that I could concentrate on was the pain wracking through body. I wished it all to end and for me to lose consciousness, but I was forced to stay awake and live through the experience. I heard a deep rumble and a voice enter my head.

After what seemed like an eternity, when in all reality it was probably only a few minutes, the purple light disappeared to be replaced by the sight of a cave ceiling staring back at me.

""You all should appreciate that you have a dedicated escort and stop complaining"" The four of them burst out laughing and Grier more irked than what she already was. When everything had quieted down, Corbin and Mags told stories about their adventures in District Four. With no one noticing, Finnick and Annie held hands under the table. Mags was the only one tonotice this and gave Finnick a mere wink. He smiled at her and rolled his eyes. Good thing everyone was laughing. If not, that would have been awkward and suspicious. After breakfast, Finnick led Annie and Corbin to the training center. All 24 tributes stayed in a bright but frigid waiting room until their names were called. A deep voice boomed through the speakers in the room.

He was afraid that he might hurt her even more. He was afraid that his life would be crumbling to pieces, once he touches her, and finds out that his worse fears had come to pass. But still, he wanted to. He gathered up the courage to hold her. He picked her up by the shoulders and placed her head on his lap.

The queen gently patted the young Magi""s head, ""Have you been doing well, Aladdin-kun?""

Badr likes you a lot,"" she placed her hands on her belly, ""so will this one and as I do, too."" She smiled in an unmistakably motherly way. Aladdin could not help but be drawn as he put his arms around the queen in a gentle embrace. Hakuei patted his head lovingly again, a gesture she bestowed only to him and Badr. It might not have been gradual but along the way, she had become like a mother, warm, gentle, strong and always loving. Aladdin broke the embrace when he felt a little tug at his black robes and found little Dunya peering at him with glittering gold eyes. The two year old was an exact copy of her mother, except that she inherited her father""s hair color and striking gold eyes. Like Badr, she was named after a person their parents didn""t want to forget.

He didn""t box me in or trap me, letting me easily slip from his grasp as I turned, but he was too close. Hardly an inch away, and I thought that if I just sucked in a big breath my chest would brush his. His hand came up, thumb rubbing just under my eye. I shivered, not entirely out of fear, unable to look away from the gleaming red above me, ominous and shrouded. It was almost a relief when he pulled away. A smile crept across his lips with all the urgency of a sloth. ""Eyelash,"" he explained, and god I""d never wanted to punch someone more.

One week later, Will woke up on time and headed to the travel magazine offices. There were a few files waiting on his desk. He began to work, taking notes on the information in the files, and paused when he came to a name that was all too familiar to him. Tessa Glasgow. He looked at the label on the file and then began to read more carefully. ""Alexei Myshkin was a KGB agent who was sent to England in the nineties. He took the alias Alec Talbot and became involved with Agent Glasgow. They were married in 1996. His true identity was discovered by Agent Glasgow in 1998. She turned him in to MI5 security section.

Out of curiousity, he glanced down at her current mission. What he read there made him curse. He shut the file and, making sure nobody was watching, stuck it under his jacket as he went out to his car. Tess sat in the conference room, only barely listening as Arvin Sloane went over the details of her upcoming mission with Sark. She glanced at the file that lay open in front of her on the table.

She had taken the shortcut home from school, and had stopped in the middle of an alleyway to text her friend, ""lol, ur so funny!"" when she heard someone behind her. She whipped around, but never got to see who it was. A club flew into her head, knocking her out cold. Zee sat up, shaking. Memories flashed through her mind. The deserted island that she was taken to after being kidnapped. Finally cutting through the ropes that bonded her, after days and days of knawing at them. Swimming as fast as she could through freezing cold water. Ending up on a barren strip of land. Walking for days, on beaches, through forests, into ruined cities, living on rats. Finally she had found herself at the edge of Panem, in District 13. They had sent her back to the Capitol, to her mother, the Arena Gamemaker. They had told her never to tell anyone that District 13 existed, including her mother, or she and whoever she told would be tortured and killed. They had tried memory modification, but back then their technology was too weak and her mind had resisted it. Now, she was glad she had. It had given her motivation to train in martial arts, swordfighting, knife throwing, and survival skills. This made her a contender in the Capitol Games, for which she

As the cheering died down, Flickerman began to speak. ""Welcome Karen, and happy Hunger Games."" ""Thank you, and may the odds be ever in your favor."" I pointed at Caesar, and looked to the crowd a smug look masking my face. The crowd hooted as Flickerman continued the interview. ""I loved your parade dressage.""

""I""m sure Tamaki would be disappointed. Didn""t he teach you to behave like a gentleman at all times?"" She noted dryly. Kaoru frowned as he fought for a reply. Then, Hikaru burst into laughter. His brother scowled. ""What""s so funny?"" He demanded. Haruhi tilted her head to the side as she examined him. ""Hikaru?"" The elder twin calmed himself down, but the sides of his mouth still remained upwards. He grinned, not focusing on either of them in particular. ""I""m sorry,"" he told them both, ""But this,"" he gestured with open palms, ""reminds me of old times."" Kaoru""s brows were still furrowed together as he remained unimpressed. ""If this were really old times, you wouldn""t let our tanuki get away with a comment like that."" Hikaru laughed again. ""Oh Kaoru, she""s so right. Even you can admit it. If Tono saw us act like that he""d have our heads."" Kaoru""s expression softened and he offered a small smile. ""Yeah, guess you""re right."" The elder twin nodded seriously. ""Now apologise to Haru."" ""What?"" ""You heard me; you insulted her, I""m sure."" Glancing in surprise, Kaoru turned to look at her. Hikaru did the same. They found her watching them with a smile plastered on her face. ""Err, Haru, what""s the matter?"" Hikaru asked. ""Oh not you too!"" Kaoru exclaimed, grinning impishly as he did. Haruhi shook her head and brushed her hair back behind her ear. ""It""s felt like old times since Honey""s party, honestly."" She admitted.

726,"Text1: Although Madge tried to put Captain Hawthorne out of her mind, he was constantly in her thoughts. She had many letters from Peeta, and when each one arrived she gleamed it for word of him. Fruitlessly so. Katniss was due to give birth soon and all Peeta""s preoccupation lay with her. Annie was recovering slowly from her injury and had remained in Seamby with Primrose attending her. Captain Odair was a most gracious and generous host and they were all eternally grateful to him. Captain Hawthorne had remained in Seamby for a week, then left on a commission from Captain Odair and there had been no mention of him since then. Peeta often dropped hints that they were expecting news of an engagement any time now. Madge lived in dread of that day. Madge returned from her walk one morning, seven weeks after arriving in Capilton to find a letter from Peeta waiting in the tray. She snatched it up eagerly, but before she could open it, Effie came rushing down the stairs to her. ""There you are, you just missed Mr Heavensbee. He was most distressed you were abroad when he called, but never fear, for you shall see him tonight. He has procured tickets for all of us for a concert."" ""How thoughtful of him."" ""A harpist,"" Effie said with a sniff. ""I myself prefer opera but Mr Heavensbee has developed an ear for instrumental music recently."" With this, she gave Madge a significant look, to which Madge feigned obliviousness. ""I look forward to it,"" Madge said politely. She excused herself to read the letter. ""You will be surprised to hear from me again,"" Peeta wrote. ""I did not think I should have to write again so soon, but once more we are blessed with great fortune and

Everything""s different, unnatural, when staying still. Even the scarce layer of branches above are artificial and blatantly man-made once I""ve been staring at them for hours on end. It is too serene, too peaceful, and it becomes terrifying. The birds shriek in their shrill voices and the trees mutter around me, and they don""t stop.

His nose was in a book, though she couldn""t tell what it""s title was. He was still holding the coffee that he had complained about the entire time they were there. She brought her attention down to her own coffee cup that was snugly tucked between her thighs. And then it suddenly clicked. ""Yeah,"" she said into the phone, ""don""t worry. Kyoya was with me."" next up will probably be Kaoru Kaoru Haruhi pulled the drapes shut. Grey clouds had been hanging over the city all afternoon, but the darkness that screamed thunderstorm had finally begun to set in. Her father wouldn""t be home for several more hours so she set about her normal routine; closing the curtains to help muffle the sound, turning on all of the lights in the living room, and finding her favorite blanket that she uses to curl up in to ride out the storm. The weatherman had been predicting this storm for days and now it was finally here. She couldn""t help but feel kind of glad-at least it would come and go and then she wouldn""t have to worry about the pending horrors anymore. Haruhi flicked on the TV to one of the romantic comedies her father had recorded on the DVR. They weren""t necessarily her top choice for entertainment, but they always made her feel calm when he wasn""t around, probably because they reminded her of her dad so much. At a silent part in the movie, Haruhi could make out the faint sound of rain tickling the roof of the apartment. So far so good. She didn""t mind the rain. In fact, she welcomed rain. Peaceful

Robin approved, giving a thumbs up. ""Well look at that? The door""s not open."" Bubbles jerked her head towards the big yellow door which led to the yearbook room. About five other girls were piled up near the door. ""Who knows. Maybe Ellie isn""t here today."" Robin pointed out. The small group dodged around a few of their rather annoying eight grade peers until they reached the door on the opposite side of the wide hallway section. ""Midori? Whats up?"" Bubbles asked one of her yearbook friends. Midori was a short, brunette seventh grader with a splash of freckles on her nose. Midori bounced eagerly on the balls of her feet. ""The shipment came in!"" ""They did?!"" Bubbles and Robin demanded in harmony, both sounding thrilled. ""Yes!"" Midori answered equally as excited. ""Why are we all out here then?"" Mike asked, towering over the selection of seventh and eighth grade yearbook students. ""Lisse went to get the keys from Mrs. Rutha""s other classroom."" An eighth grader named Taylor answered, leaning against the wall. ""Yeah, except that was five minutes ago!"" A different girl named Emmy pointed out. Her eye lashes were so long, there was no way that they were real. ""Give her a break will ya?"" Midori shot back, one eyebrow raised slightly. ""Yeah!"" Another eighth grader named Teya agreed. """"Sides,"" Katie, Taylor""s best friend, interrupted, ""Ellie already went to see what was taking Lisse so long."" ""Geez people."" Robin muttered under her breath so only Bubbles could hear. ""I know right. But I""m sure everyone just wants to see the yearbooks."" Bubbles murmured back. ""Bubbles!"" A voice called from behind.","{""output"": ""YES""}"

I plug in my headphones just as the screaming starts when the announcer asks the rabid fan girls if they""re ready for their favorite boy band to come out yet. Their screams are so loud to the point I felt the vibrations in my feet. I click on Cascada playlist and put it as high as it can go. About an hour passes and as I am on the last chapter of my chapter I feel someone nudge me. I pay no attention them and continue reading my book as quickly as I can because I am at the climax of the novel. I feel my ear buds ripped of my ears, my iPod taken, and a harsh stomp on my foot in one swift motion. I look to my side with a deadly glare to see Hotaru glaring back at me with her icy glare. ""What the hell was that for, Hotaru?! Give me that book and iPod back before I have to kick your ass! You know I have a descent amount of training in martial arts, an ex-soldier taught me a few things as you recall. I want to finish that freaking book!""

She says with an actual smile (not a smirk, but a smile) and a genuine chuckle while handing my stuff back to me.

""As promised, you get a kiss on the cheek from the lovely Amu and a date with her."" Suki says with a wink towards me. We all know a kiss wasn""t included in this, but thanks to my awesome friend, she included it. With a quick peck from me, Ikuto""s face turns red. I never thought he was capable of turning such a lovely shade of red. We are called back to where the events started and congratulated for our efforts and what not. Apparently, while we were gone Kairi asked Yaya out, Rima and Nagi made things official, and Kukai and Utau have a ""non-date-date"" planned for tomorrow. I can tell from the fire in Kukai""s eyes, by the end of that ""non-date-date"" it will become a date. Ikuto suggests our date be tomorrow as we walk home, and I happily agree.

""OW what the hell? Why did that hurt?"" He looked surprised and then pulled out quickly. ""Um Yuki, did you know you are, well were a virgin again?"" I looked at him like he grew two heads when time stopped and then a giggle emitted from beside me. I covered up and saw the little brat. ""Stupid perverted brat Faythe, what do you want?"" He giggled again and then spoke. ""Sorry Yuki I forgot to tell you that anything that didn""t actually happen in the game didn""t happen in real life and so since your virginity wasn""t really taken here and in the game you are well was a virgin."" With that he disappeared and time started again. ""Well this is great brat Faythe said that since we didn""t have sex in this world that I am a virgin here.""

It still hurt and then I felt it the pressure, he didn""t even stop when he was in fully he just rammed in, and moved slowly. I felt like I did the first time, except this time he was a bit rougher and didn""t really pay attention to his thrusts. He bent down and landed kisses all over me and then would move faster and harder, I moved my legs over his hips and tried to thrust in time with him. It was then that I forgot that I had a condom

I smiled faintly at him, and he turned away. He was wearing simple black slacks, a white shirt with the buttons undone and black dress shoes. He looked too fancy to be in this small town. Loki: The woman seemed to notice me as she smiled. I turned away. I still kept an eye on her through the corners of my eyes. She spun and swayed through the crowd. I smiled faintly as I saw her steal wallets from men""s pockets unnoticed, that sly fox. She was a trickster, and therefore I was compelled to speak to her. I shook my head; I must not converse with mortals. However, I was still in need of a source of money. I could always steal- but that would end me in yet another cell for eternity. I may hate these mortals, but I hate that boredom of the cell ever more. I headed into a small shop that had a help wanted sign in the window. Unlike my brother, I had tact. I grabbed the sign and set it on the counter. It was a bookstore of sorts. The cashier- an elder woman- looked at me with a judged eye. I smiled flakily, too used to fooling these gullible creatures. She smiled back, ""Well, for a job you must fill out this application."" She handed me a piece of parchment and a writing utensil. I nodded and took a seat to fill it out.

The next morning, I woke up before Ritsu. I put my paw on the alarm clock and he woke up rather fast. I then headed to Tetsuya""s room to make sure he was awake. He was still asleep- though I blushed when I realized that unlike Ritsu, he didn""t sleep with pants on, just his boxers. I still had to wake him up though. I jumped up and pawed at his face since he didn""t have an alarm like Ritsu. After all, Tetsuya was a body guard- though I knew they were also friends. Tetsuya saw me and he blushed slightly. I shrugged- as much as I could as a cat anyway- and left.

He pulls his hands from the brunet""s desperate grasp and flings his arms around Will""s neck in a tight embrace burying his face in the crook of his neck, ""Ever since our first reaping together I knew I loved you more than anyone and that""s the truth."" Grell inhales deeply taking in the scent of Will""s cologne. He smiles against his superior""s neck when he feels Will""s arms wrap securely around his body returning the embrace, ""All those other people I flirt with, especially Sebas-chan, they don""t love me. Hell, they can barely even tolerate me. I can tell by the way they look at me that they don""t love me, but you do and that""s all that matters to me, Will."" He releases his hold on the dark haired shinigami and finally smiles showing all his razor sharp teeth, ""To tell you the truth, Will, as long as you love me all those other people, demons, and whatnot can go straight to hell."" Will returns Grell""s smile with a rare but genuine smile of his own, ""I""m glad to hear it."" The ruby haired reaper closes his eyes and gently presses his lips to the smiling ones in front of him. The kiss is a chaste one when it begins, but soon turns heated as their tongues clash together

Finally, the little dog scuttles away, his tail still wagging furiously, and I follow his lead with my eyes, until they meet two somewhat familiar, tennis-shoe clad feet. I run my eyes up the muscular legs, thin waste, perfectly shaped torso, and finally, her wonderful, beautiful face. It takes my eyes a second to take in her sight, but I do notice the thin layer of white powder covering most of her body. I remember her comment about making tortillas, and I recognize the white powder as flour. It is dusted over her clothes, highlighting her crimson hair, smeared across her left cheek, the right side of her chin, her forehead, and her nose. She is not wearing any makeup; a rare sight, but the absence of the material does not make her any less stunning. Finally, my eyes meet her captivating green ones, and I am at a loss. But, at least, I finally understand what I am doing here. ""Hi."" Is the only thing I seem able to croak out. She raises one eyebrow, her obvious amusement at my loss for words leaking from her every perfect pore. ""Hey, Mulder."" She seems fine. I guess I am not as stunning as she is. Or, maybe she is still afraid of me. As I run my eyes over her again, reality starts to leak back into my smut-ridden brain. For God""s sake, just six days ago I was holding a gun trained at the woman! And now, here I am... I haven""t even apologized to her, yet I am fantasizing about her in her own apartment.

""Well, my momma told me about a girl who was murdered and used to live here, so I thought it might be you. That""s what you looked so shocked this afternoon at dinner, right? Because you didn""t know that this house was now a boardinghouse?"" I was impressed that she could figure all this out, even at such a young age. ""Oh..."" I replied half heartedly, ""So that""s why they aren""t here. My family, I mean. Since this is a boardinghouse, right?"" The young girl nodded. ""So where are they?"" I asked. I was itching to know, I needed to know the answer. I wasn""t sure I was prepared for it, though. The girl""s expression of indifference suddenly softened, looking sad. ""They""re...they, um, passed away. In a fire,"" she said in a small voice. Tears sprang to my eyes before I could stop them. Death, I could handle. Loss, I could handle. But did their lives have to end so terribly? Did they have to die like I did, in pain? I looked back up at the girl after I had been staring so intently at the stitching in my dress, but not seeing it. To my dismay, she had gone. Sighing, I turned back to the window. It will be another thirty years of nothingness, then? I thought miserably. Being stuck in a limbo between life and the afterlife was no joke. I suddenly felt a wave of compassion for all of those ghosts who I had dealt with so impatiently. Things continued much the same for the next hundred and twenty years, passing slowly but surely.

She needs to be strong, for all the people betting on her-Cinna, Haymitch, her family, Gale, Madge, Peeta. She needs to be the ground for their faith and the walls that keep their hope safe. She needs to be the Girl on Fire. When the platform begins to rise and the ceiling opens to sunshine, she looks up to meet it. On their way home, Katniss and Gale stop at the Hob, the black market in the district. They are easily the youngest people there. Gale fits right in, having looked like a full grown man since they met. Katniss, on the other hand, looks much more like the sixteen year-old girl she is. ""Well, look at this pretty little thing.""

""Wait... Lava?' She thought. She shifted slightly and found that it was impossible for her to move; she was bound a post with thick, heavy rope overlooking the edge of a short cliff that fell off into a large lava pit. Rayna turned her face away to avoid the blistering heat of the Nether. She could hear mobs roaming about but a glance upward showed her that she was inside in a glass dome to prevent them from getting to her. Rayna struggled against her bonds with little luck.

I am not from New Orleans, I did not grow up there, however I did grow up about two hours from the city and have been there many times in my life. Driving in New Orleans is not for the light hearted , it""s extremely chaotic and probably worse than driving in any other big area. People are either in a rush or going snail""s pace there is no in between, truck drivers don""t give a damn about anyone else and it can be really confusing getting around as street signs aren""t always visible. Getting out of Louis Armstrong airport is hard, and always backed up. End of disclaimer thing. Please let me know what you thought of this chapter. Thank you for reading!

But honestly he really hadn""t expected this. She""d turned down a road that only had a few houses on either side of the street. The homes themselves were what you thought of when someone said old southern homes. There was a singular house that the street dead ended to, it was every bit as picturesque as the rest of the homes.

He smacked the back of Kaleb""s head and pushed him out the door, taking one last, hard look at their target before they left. One little Harper Lewis. With a dark past. I felt a chill run up my spine, and looked around quickly, feeling eyes on my back. Seeing nothing particularly unusual than a man in a purple-ish trench coat leaving, and a couple of young couples making their way to a private corner in their drunken states, I turned back to my drink. I was bouncing my foot to the music when suddenly, the music shut down and the lights snapped on in blinding fluorescents, leaving dots on my eyelids when I closed my eyes trying not to be blinded. The next few minutes were a blur of events, groups of men in black padded uniforms coming in, with their guns pointed to the ceilings. I couldn""t hear what they were saying, all their voices jumbled together from them talking at the same time, but I saw people laying face down on the ground where they stood, so I decided to do the same. Soon I saw Cassidy and Daniel making their way over to me, a worried look in both their eyes. They asked if I was okay, I nodded, not trusting myself to say anything. After that, police officers came in, along with the commissioner. That""s when I knew something was wrong. I looked up, and saw the V.I.P. lounge completely deserted.

Sakura looked away as Komaku blew a kiss and drove off. The college student walked on campus and noticed something strange. Everyone within a fifty feet radius was backing away with every step Sakura took. ""Do I smell or something?"" Sakura thought. She did remember to put on perfume in the morning. Sakura cautiously entered the school and the hallways were the same as the outside. Everyone was avoiding her and she didn""t know why. She found her classroom and as soon as she opened the door, everyone stopped their conversations and looked at her. They scooted back in their seats when she put one foot in the room. Sakura fell to her knees before taking another step. ""What the hell did I do?!"" she whined in her head. ""What""s up with you?"" In front of Sakura stood a tall girl in a black tank top and jeans. She wore a green plaid shirt as a jacket and had thin rimmed glasses in front of her silver eyes. She had silver hair that just barely touched her shoulders. She sort of looked like Komaku. ""Eh?

But, that was part of his charm. ""You should take a hint from your senpai and be more cheerful,"" I said to the twins. They glared at me and sat in the grass. This was normal and not scary at all, considering I was older and more mature, if I do say so myself. However, when I got daggers sent to me by Kyoya, I felt a bit scared for my life.

Instead, her eyes trailed the cerulean dress wistfully, appreciating every subtle detail from the lacy ruffled neckline to the pleated out-layer skirt. ""The shade would certainly suit your eyes,"" Paula agreed amiably, her demeanor softening and anxiousness melting away from observing her charge""s blatant happiness. The two lingered in front of the store, unsure if purchasing the dress would be a betrayal of Nina""s trust. Fortunately, their musing was cut off by a familiar voice.

Text2: Mikasa""s words stay with him for the rest of the training session, and for quite some time more. He finds himself paying more attention to Armin. In doing so, he realizes how little time they spend together these days. They have none of their classes together - Armin lags far behind Eren in all of the physical courses and surpasses him greatly in tactical and theory ones. When they are separated into groups, they never end up together. They sit side by side during lunch, but Armin never speaks up or joins the conversation. He melts into the background. These days, they are closest at night. Training camp allows each person to bring one personal belonging; Armin had brought his book about the outside world. Due to spatial restraints, there are several bunkbeds, with each bunk further separating two people by a divider.

Goat cheese (probably from Lady) and oats were set on the table. We ate in silence until Prim broke it by saying, ""So Katniss, are you scared for the reaping? Do you think they""ll call you? Or maybe me?"" She had a running mouth that always got her in trouble. Especially be me. ""Are you Katniss? Are you?"" she asked, pushing my buttons. With her saying that, I lost it. ""YES!

I said yelling in her face. As soon as I saw water fill her eyes, I stomped out the kitchen. In mine and Prim""s room, I braided my hair and put on a shirt and pants made with an odd material called ""denim"" my mom bought at a shop. I raced outside and jumped over the gate to the Meadow. I had taken my bow and arrow from the side of our house to see if I would get lucky enough and kill a jackrabbit or two. Just as I placed an arrow on my bow, something stirred in the tree above me and I silently aimed it upwards. Then it came down and moved behind me and I felt myself tense. I turned around quickly, having my arrow ready to shoot an animal with some decent meat. It""s eyes met mine just as I released the arrow and barely missed his right arm. ""Gale! I thought you were an animal! I almost got your arm!"" He laughed and I punched

We will do this at night time"" Zac tells us. ""Why night time?"" asks Max. ""That was my idea. There will be mobs out so when we blow up the castle, the mobs can also attack Josh, and night time is none for its darkness, which means Josh won""t see us coming"" Julian explained. ""Yes well, tomorrow we rest and craft. See you guys in the morning"" Zac said,walking into my room. I followed him inside and went to sleep. I woke up at 10. Everyone was up except me.

They eventually decided on the mountainous area just west of Tepic, which lay to the north of them. They floated around rural villages and finally decided to try their luck at living in a real town with all the amenities they had longed for. The town of Jesus Maria provided them with just that. Electricity was spotty, but it existed. When they turned the tap, hot water would usually come out. Apartments were within their price range, though John was realizing that in another year or two, money would start to become an issue. Their alibi came to them like a gift - the landlord mentioned that he had once rented a flat to a couple of writers who were researching the area. Monica jumped on the bandwagon quickly and exclaimed that they two were writers, working on a book about the people and cultures of the state of Nayarit, which seemed to be explanation enough for the man. The strangest thing, though, that they found upon their return to civilization was the complete lack of knowledge as to who they really were. No one seemed to recognize them. Their faces were not on wanted posters at the post office. Newspapers and TV had forgotten them. They could not explain it, and they did not want to take it for granted, but they all knew that it probably didn""t mean that they were safe.

They snuck out of the back servant""s entrance and made their way out to the back road, pushing the snow out of their way as they went. So they walked, their foots sinking deep into the snow with every step they took. They walked for several blocks until they were out of their privileged neighborhood and onto the normal streets.

In their minds the fact that they were twins only seemed more of a reason to get together, who better to understand you than your blood and soul? They didn""t love each other in that way of course, or at least they hadn""t thought they did but as they thought in silence they knew somewhere along their life they had began to feel something akin to romance towards each other. It was wrong on so many different levels; it was incest...twincest even. But as they thought deeper about it they could both honestly say that they didn""t care what people said but it wasn""t love. It was unnamed at the moment; it might have been a phase so Zack broke the thoughtful silence.

""Get the phone,"" he told Adam, but Adam was already on it, David hovering over his shoulder, asking if that was her. Adam gave one short nod - it was the woman they were waiting for. He punched the speakerphone button. The filtering of the static made Elisabeth Rycoff""s voice sound a bit harsh, almost tempered. For the last half hour, maybe, she had been down in Las Nieves, Mexico, having caught a flight down with fellow CTU agent Chase Edmunds in order to come to the assistance of their friend and comrade, Jack Bauer. Of course, David also knew the rest of the story - Jack was also Liz""s lover of the last two years, and she was down there not only because Jack would likely need help if something went wrong (which something had, but she didn""t know that), but because Jack had betrayed her trust by not telling her he was going back undercover, and she needed to know what she had left to do if she couldn""t trust him anymore.

From his distance he could see her red hair and detected the paleness of her flesh. He""d hoped her eyes were blue, it""d be perfect if they were.

At first he was hesitant to react, even his peculiar and curious mind told him to leave it be. Besides, the last time he was there he didn""t have the best of luck with spying.

My duty is to protect the forest, and you have destroyed its keepers,"" she indicated the exhausted attack force before them. Peter was taken aback by the statement. No one before the catacomb had even noticed that the young girl was there until she spoke out. When she did though, there was a sweeping admiration among the warriors.

My God, that sounds so pitiful in my head. Mulder and I... we talk. We talk a lot about cases. We talk about other things as well, though. We talk about what we will do when we get our vacations (never). We crack jokes. We are close friends, who trust each other implicitly. Well, almost. Back when I still associated with other people besides Mulder, I learned about the nature of the relationship between many FBI agent partners. Many of my friends, ones that had been quite close to me before I attained the title of Mrs. Spooky, had talked to me about ""emotional check-ins"" they had had with their partners. They had conversations about their feelings towards cases they had worked on, about how they felt about their partnership. I learned that this was actually something recommended by ""The Book"". Mulder doesn""t go by ""The Book"". Mulder hasn""t gone by ""The Book"" since his stint in the Violent Crimes section, with the Barnell catastrophe. But, this makes it sounds like the lack of spoken emotional connection between Mulder and I is purely Mulder""s fault; I have not exactly instigated any heart to hearts. I have my reasons. Talking to Mulder about how I reacted to certain cases could be problematic. For example, there is the Protect-Mulder-At-All-Costs reaction. How exactly am I supposed to explain to Mulder that I value his safety over my own? Oh FBI rule book, provide me with answers.

Law noticed that after the meal Miku was hardly around him. She would disappear every time he came into the room. And for some reason, the heat his body felt would plument and he would feel upset. Why, he didn""t know but it was starting to annoy him when his emotions started tying into the feeling he gets when he was with Miku. And now that he realizes she was avoiding him the heat got only worse before turning him to ice. Sitting in the medical bay, he waited to see if Miku would come in to get her days supply of blood. The last few times she somehow got it without him seeing her. The thought of her made

Taking to the curtain area I heard Haruhi getting dressed next to curtain so I choose next to her and opened the box. It was blue from the first glance. The male""s uniform... Well at least they didn""t get me a dress...though that would call for these boys to know the difference of a male and a female... ""Uh, sempai?"" Haruhi called out. ""Are you finished?"" Tamaki asked. Was the whole club over here? What about their guest?! I was standing near the curtain, I wasn""t about to step out first and have them comment my eyes in the same way everyone else did. I must look like a freak like this. Why couldn""t I just wear what I came in? There was nothing wrong with it. I even got permission from the principal to wear that. ""Is it really okay for me to keep this?"" I heard the curtain open which lead to Tamaki saying she was a cute as a girl. Dumbass, she is a girl... ""Where""s Angel-chan?"" Honey stated. I frowned as I knew that they wouldn""t allow me to just hide away in this room until everyone was gone. But a girl could hope right? ""Angel, just come out. I""m sure you look great as usual."" Haruhi stated with a sigh. And before the twins could say something someone opened the curtain, showing me to the club members. I saw it was Haruhi that revealed me. I frowned at her and shifted a little. ""Wow Angel-chan! You look so cool!"" Honey stated as he looked at me with wide eyes. The twins seemed","{""output"": ""YES""}"

""Just looking up something,"" said Yui, only to suddenly let off a gasp and nearly fall out of her seat. ""What?"" Hades asked hurrying over to the computer. There he saw a picture of a ceraste on the screen. ""That""s what Umeko was fighting?!"" Yui demanded to know. ""Yes, that""s a ceraste,"" Hades said sheepishly. ""Oh my god!"" Yui screamed, ""oh my god!"" ""I know, I know!"" Hades said, trying to comfort her, ""but you knew this could happen, remember?"" ""Yes, but this ,this is making it even more real! She really could have died today! Hades is there anything, anything that can help protect?!"" ""No, not unless we want her to pass,"" said Hades. ""Umeko!"" Yui cried burying her face in Hades""s chest. She felt so helpless as a parent as her daughter kept going off to fight more creatures like that horrible beast from today.

But somehow, these tight denim jeans, which were the equivalent of spray paint and an equally tight t-shirt with the word ""HACKER"" written across it""s chest really frightened her. Sonya sighed and threw the garments on her bed. They landed next to the red satin push up bra and a studded black leather belt. She turned toward her mirror and saw a proper young woman in a suit with perfectly coifed hair looking back. The dark maroon suit was very stylish for a businesswoman... the high necked blouse stylish for a church going businesswoman, the leather pumps stylish for a church going businesswoman who was in her forties. She rolled her eyes at herself and took her hands and mussed up her hair, pulling strands around her face and creating an unruly mass of curls. Her dressing table was uncharacteristically messy, with pots of eye and lip color and the equipment to affix a pair of false eyelashes. It was a bit daunting but the girls on you tube made it look easy and encouraged their watchers to go dramatic. Even the women monitoring the flash news feeds wore color and shine. She was blessed with a flawless complexion and had a routine: eyeliner, mascara and lip gloss were her staples. She""d always thought making yourself up was rubbish, but the last few months had made her painfully aware of how she looked. Sonya thought Birkhoff looked like a rock","{""output"": ""NO""}"

I stifled my moans and gasps, his hands were gripping my hips tighter and rubbing them, it felt nice, but I couldn""t think straight. I looked at the ceiling and then patted his head.

Why hurt myself even more than I already am from this? Then she put her arms around my neck, and started kissing me. I felt shivers going up and down my spine, and it felt great. My heart was beating faster than lighting. Querida was kissing me, and I knew we should have stopped.

It just didn""t seem possible for this to happen to him. Russell saw his vision start to blur, and he began to feel dizzy, feeling nausea run through him.

He turned onto his side, thinking back to what Sniffles had told him before he passed out then letting out a loud, irritated groan and diving under the covers. Honestly, he didn""t believe Sniffles, but he""s the most trustworthy out of all the Happy Tree Friends, so everything that came out of his mouth was believable. The bluenette sat up and brought his knees closer to himself, the only thing he could think about at the moment is how he became pregnant in the first place. He thought back to all of the guys who he had a close relationship to: Cuddles and Toothy obviously have a thing for each other(or so everyone says), so they can""t be responsible, Handy is dating Petunia, Nutty has a crush on Sniffles, and Disco Bear is too busy trying to flirt with Giggles and Petunia.

A line of white-hot burning sensations followed here after and traveled upward and along my jaw line. The string of warmth subsided as soon as one scorching contact met with my skin just above my collarbone. I gasped as my eyes shot open...and what I saw after was not what I had been seeing less than two minutes ago. This scene was indeed a familiar one, but it was not entirely a truthful one; it was almost deceiving, having slight variations that differentiated it from its origin. What I saw was the same spring day and the exact same pedals fell in front of our feet. My hair danced in the breeze coming from the ocean, tickling my face and parts of my neck. And then suddenly, a rebellious strand of dancing hair found its way inside of my nose. Upon reaction I began to rub it energetically to stop the tickling sensation that it gave me. I tried tossing my hair aside to keep the lock out of my nose for good, but the damned wind blew it back into my face. I frantically began to push my hair back, but stopped when I looked up into the face of my unknown ghost to se him laughing hysterically. ""Great smile...' was what I found myself thinking.

Hair mussed in ten different directions, his fine clothes worn by salt and sand. If you watch him doing tiny things, just rubbing his eyes or stretching a little, you wouldn""t be able to tell he""s a Prince. But then he rises and there is

This was a message and I understand what he was saying pretty well, but where was the ""tree that looks like a tower""? I scanned the trees around me, but I couldn""t see very much. I went to a nearby boulder and climbed up. Before I got all the way up I saw something. A dried puddle of blood it looked like, right beside the bank of the river. I started down and went over to the stain. It was blood, but there was more. I followed the trail of dried blood to the edge of the woods. I looked into the woods but it was too dark to see anything a few feet from me. Move. My mind said, but I just stood there. Was she really in there or was this a trap? You have no choice if it isn""t a trap she will die and you will know it is your fault. My mind said. I stared into the dark. I grabbed a knife out of my bag and started walking. It wasn""t as dark as I""d thought it was. I looked around and looked up at the trees. There was one taller than the rest straight ahead of me. I reached the tree and looked around. When I looked at the ground there was another dry puddle of blood. These were days old, not recent. This puddle was small. It fell from somewhere else. I looked up in the tree and sure enough there was a branch that was stained darker than the rest of the tree. She""d been in","{""output"": ""NO""}"

""That would be great, thank you Ukyo."" I accepted gratefully before sitting down at the table to eat. I was still tired and I barely managed to finish my food before I found my head bobbing up and down sleepily, struggling to keep awake. ""I think it""s time someone went to bed.""

""Master Splinter? Can you hear me?"" He groaned very lightly but that did not satisfy us.

Our relationship was too complex for that title. But we did actually get along every once in a while. Once or twice I could""ve sworn I saw him smile. Of course, sometimes my teasing went too far and Derek, furious, reverted to yelling and the occasional slap behind the head. But things like that never stopped me. I would always come back and do it all over again. Some days I would annoy him so much that I knew I had to draw a line or I would be a victim of murder. Today was one of those days. But sadly, I forgot to draw the line. I had been taunting him all day: Calling him names, making fun of his leather jacket, muttering things under my breath that he could just barely hear. I knew I was getting close to having to stop, but I didn""t realize how close when I followed him out of our 5th period classroom. I chattered continuously, talking quickly like I knew he hated.

Kaname had not doubt that Sosuke would come back. He never broke his promises. One rainy Saturday morning around a month since Sosuke had left; Kaname was quietly watching the television when a knock came at the door.

You wickedness against the innocent shall be paid by eternal suffering in the Nether. Your soul shall be forever entrapped in soul sand."" The man said to the raider before pulling the sword out, then cutting him in two. As the former living body of ash and ember that was once a man fell, it broke apart and flurried upwards. Nothing remained of the raider, not even the iron armor he wore. Logan turned away from the bodies of the clothes maid and her child, and sprinted down the street in the direction of Vera""s forge and home. Vera had barricaded the iron door and the windows of her home-workplace. Outside was at least ten raiders trying to get in. In Vera""s slightly shaking hands was a diamond sword which had Sharpness III. She readied herself to strike down any raider that got through. ""I""m not going down without a fight!"" Vera thought to herself as she stood ready to strike. The sound of raiders trying to break in died away and was replaced by many footsteps. Vera could just barely hear a faint hissing noise near the door. She realized what it was a moment too late and she was sent sprawling to the floor as the shock wave ripped through the building. The world seemed to bend and curve around Vera as she struggled to get up from the wooden floor. She heard only a high pitched ringing and the front of her body throbbed painfully, her arms in particular. The ringing began to subside as Vera reached for the diamond sword that laid two feet in front of her. The little

What about Thresh""s first kill? Was the idea good with Rue? Should he have killed the boy? Should he have taken the career""s stuff? What should he do next chapter? As You can see I really need reviews. So, if you""ve read this please review! Hey guys. I just wanted to thank all of you people for the reviews and favorites. Please remember though, favorites are nice, but I prefer reviews. Now I""ve got three big questions I really need answered Should most of Thresh""s battle""s be one on one (Thresh vs. someone) or two on two or two on one (Thresh vs. two people)? Should Cato and Thresh continue their very strong rivalry or should it be downed or upped a little bit? Should Thresh and Caon""s alliance have them become friends or simply allies? Also, feel free to tell me of any ideas you have for the story and I""ll try to incorporate them into the story. Thanks to everyone who reviewed the last chapter it means a lot. Wesley- Sorry, I""m trying very hard, thanks for the appreciation of effort. I""m happy to know you can relate. Liana111- Thanks, I""m trying to make it very believable, I wanted Thresh to have an alliance because I felt that at one point, Cato and Clove would both attack Thresh and it wouldn""t have been realistic for Thresh to win without help. Also, thanks for being my most dedicated reviewer! Fireoxmysox- Thanks for the compliment. Hunger Games Fanatic- Sorry, I don""t have the book with me.

But, if you need a little reminder of what you""re getting I""d be happy to oblige."" He said lustfully. I put my arms around his neck and pulled his head down so I could put his lips on mine. We stayed that way for about three minutes, just kissing while other kids went and found out where they were supposed to be. All of those people didn""t matter though. All that mattered was that Gale and I were together. ""Honey, I""ve got to go, but I""ll see you in first period."" He said as he pulled away from me. ""Great, Geometry. Just kill me now."" I hated math. It was my worst subject. ""Hey, maybe we""ll get to pick our seats. We could sit next to each other, in the back of the class."" Gale came so close to me that I could feel his breath on my face when he talked. ""Oh God I hope so."" I said. ""I""ll see you there!"" Gale had already picked up his things and had begun to walk away. ""Okay!"" I yelled back at him. I opened my locker again and looked at my schedule, which I had sloppily dropped on my books and lock.

I slowly walk over to her, afraid to spook her, not wanting her to vanish into thin air. But she barely notices me, picking up a dandelion and blowing the pods into the wind. My breath catches in my throat, and she looks up, smiling.""Katniss,"" she says in her sweet voice, one I haven""t heard speak a normal word in so long.

Hikaru huffed, ""That""s it, I""m taking back ""gorgeous"", too. Is that really all you have to say about me? I""m heavy?"" ""You""re heavy and pretty?"" I said innocently. Hikaru scoffed. Nevertheless, he apparently took that as his cue to sprawl unmoving on top of me, his hands buried beneath the pillow behind my head. I closed my eyes and sighed softly; he wasn""t nearly that heavy, really, but it was somewhat different to be pressed between him and the mattress. I wasn""t sure how I felt about it at the moment and shifted slightly. ""What""re you thinking about now?"" Hikaru mumbled. I sighed. ""That we should probably get up sometime, so the maids don""t wonder where we are."" Hikaru smirked against me. ""Not until I move."" ""I noticed."" Ringing again echoed up from the floor, the sound farther away this time. Whoever was so desperate on contacting us this morning had moved on to Hikaru""s phone. At the thought I ran my hands up his sides, holding him incapable of answering the interruption. Unperturbed by the sound, Hikaru stroked my hair. ""That""s Haruhi, isn""t it?"" ""Yeah...""

Three more battle droids appeared around them. ""Intruders. Must destroy,"" the lead battle droid instructed the others. They raised their blasters. Unexpectedly, a figure dropped down from above. A beam of gold light slashed through the first battle droid, and it fell to the ground with a clatter. The other droids turned their weapons on the newcomer, but the gold blade sliced them before they could shoot. The newcomer stepped forward into the light and Blue saw that he was a teenaged boy. He had dark hair streaked with gold that gleamed in the light. ""You must be a Jedi!"" Steve said brightly. The boy nodded, flicking off his gold lightsaber. ""Who are you?"" he asked calmly, as if he had not just battled the four droids. ""I""m Steve, and this is my puppy, Blue!"" Steve introduced. The boy bowed slightly. ""Ferus Olin, Jedi Padawan."" He straightened and regarded them with interest. ""You""re the two who are here to visit the Temple, aren""t you?"" Steve nodded. ""I could take you back to the Temple,"" Ferus offered.

A baby popped it out and handed it to her, the picture of a young girl with red pigtails and a gape-toothed smile. The picture began to fade. ""Jill,"" she murmured, sadness inking her voice. The babies around her twittered sadly. ""Well, it happens to all of them,"" she consoled the babies. ""Sink it in the pool. We have work to do.""

So, would you really like to try, or just wait out the storm and try after?"" He asked, and she blinked as she thought about it.

Then back down to her, and eased away like he was afraid that if he moved to fast he would frighten her. Once they were apart he sat up, and gave a sheepish grin with apologetic eyes.

And your brother is trying to make sure that he doesn""t bother us."" She stated, watching as he nodded, stretched, then headed for the door. She blinked when he looked back over his shoulder and winked at her as he grabbed the handle. She leaned closer when he stepped to the side slightly, and then jerked the door open.

With Haruhi""s back on his palm he settled her down on the bed with her head at the top on the pillows and quickly took her panties off so they were both exposed in front of each other.

He took her hands in his and let Haruhi feel his softly toned body, and when she began to move her hands on her own he began to kiss and nibble more flesh. From her collar down to her shoulder then to her breasts when he stayed there to play with them for a bit .Haruhi began to arch her body up to his mouth bit by bit.

His face contorted into a mask of pain, and he sighed. Katniss was the girl he loved who went to the Hunger Games. And then she fell for the bakers son, Peeta Melark. The boy with the bread. We were silent for the rest of the trip. We traded in the squirrels for a nice load of bread. From the new baker. Peeta""s family didn""t need the money anymore. They were free to live in prosperity. Carrying a slightly stale piece of bread in one hand, and a small basket of biscuits in the other, Gale looked towards the sky. ""I""ll do it."" I smiled at him in thanks. ""I don""t want her to die.

""Yes, sweetie, but you know you can always use my paintings if you want to,"" ""Thank you,"" she pressed her lips to his cheek.

In conclusion, their daughter had many new gifts. Katniss""s mother was currently living in Florida, very close to their friend Finnick, his wife Annie, and their 10 year old son. He and Peeta had been good friends since college, and they sent them a Christmas card every year, inviting them over whenever they wanted to go to the beach, Katniss had wanted to go and spend Christmas in there, but her doctor said she was too far into her pregnancy to be traveling, especially after her fall in October, so they agreed to visit them in the summer.

Rengi ignored the two glaring females and simply grabbed the doorknob and twisted it. The door swung open with no resistance. Stunned into silence, they all made their way into the silent flat. Ishida froze in the entrance to her bedroom. There hanging harmlessly on the outside of the wardrobe was a light blue silk dress. The dress Orihime had worn to the Christmas party 3 months ago. At the sight of that dress, it was as if a dam broke in Ishida""s mind, previously forgotten memories came flooding to the surface of his mind. His heart beat quickened; his breathing became laboured as he remembered. He remembered the dress, he remembered gently removing it from Orihime, he remembered lowering her down gently onto his bed. He remembered making love to her. He could remember every second of it. His eyes flew to Tatsuki as she appeared behind him. Ishida turned to face her, there were tears running down her face and everyone was waiting for her to say something. ""The shrine""s gone. Orihime""s gone."" Ichigo was the first to react.

Quickly, he latched on to the delicate nub, sucking it while he entered her with one finger. She was more than ready, her wetness told him so. Faster and faster he massaged her clit while pumping his finger in and out in rhythmic fashion, until she finally screamed out in ecstasy. He removed his hand, allowing her juices to pour freely into his mouth. He raised himself back up to meet her face to face, smiling at her, he truly loved her, there would be no other he decided only Molly. Molly grabbed him by his neck and pulled his mouth into hers. The taste of herself was intoxicating. Neither of the two could wait any longer. With his knee, he spread her legs further apart. He positioned himself at her entrance. Closing her eyes, she wrapped her arms tightly around the same man she knew was going to hurt her. A shudder shook him as she surrendered in his arms and he inched his throbbing shaft into her incredible warmth, uncertain how much pain he was going to cause her and desperate to lessen it. The time her had taken with her had eased her passage, and he felt her silken warmth tightly sheathing him, expanding to encase him. Twisted into knots of desire, his heart beating painfully, he eased himself into her until he finally encountered the fragile barrier. He withdrew by inches and shifted forward again, and then withdrew, poised to breach the barrier, desperate to bury himself within her, hating the pain he was going to cause her.

He is squatting by the side of the water, his fair hair falling over his eyes as he stirs with a stick to break up the clarity of his own reflection. He wants to deny that his shoulders have grown strong and his legs are sturdy from years of clambering over the rocks and jumping the many streams that feed the lake. He knows he is handsome and that tradition dictates it is time he takes a wife from amongst the rosy cheeked village girls that giggle and whisper each time that he passes. They are not what he wants. He does not know what he wants, but his dreams are haunted by the beautiful voice of a girl lamenting the love she watches yet does not have. Every time he starts to become certain the song is about him, the dream melts away and the silence of his reality reminds him it is fruitless to search for someone that only exists in his mind.

I...figured he would have liked it... I shake my head to clear my thoughts and finish brushing my hair, setting the brush down on the coffee table next to me.

I nodded and we walked back to the district, after making a quick stop to the tree. Hojo went to his house and I went to mine. When I walked in, my mother was fixing my little brother, Sota""s, shirt. Sota did not look happy at all. It was his first year to be in the reaping. ""Sis! I don""t want to go!"" he shouted. My mother patted his head and told him it""ll be okay. He didn""t listen and ran to hug me. ""Sis!"" he cried. I patted his back and he let go of me, sniffling. I fished through my pocket and held out a small necklace in front of his face. The necklace was nothing more than a piece of string and a purple marble attached. ""What is this?"" he asked, examining the necklace in his hands. ""It""s a good luck charm. If you wear it, you""ll be safe,"" I said. His brown eyes lit up and he put the necklace on. Sota seemed happy until the bell rang throughout the town. It was time to go.

Though on the other hand he was always closer with Katniss, so the divorce kind of drove us farther apart. I remember begging him for help, when she first started the drugs, and when there was a chance of her recovering, he just shrug it off telling me I worry too much. When he see me he rolls his eyes and laughs while asking, ""What did you do this time?""

Dammit! Ichigo swung the book bag down on the floor with a heavy thud before sitting down cross-legged in a huff, arms crossing to further show the irritable disposition radiating out from the teen. It was then that the orange-haired first year seemed to finally flip out as he scrambled to yank off his uniform jacket, tie, and crisp white dress shirt. There was a flurry of discarded clothing before Ichigo managed to force a calmer intake of breath, hands held out as if to ease away the stress. Without the upper pieces to the uniform, Ichigo was left sitting in the middle of the living room in a tank top and black slacks. Wrapped about the tank top, primarily concentrated on the upper chest, was a four inch wide Ace bandage that was normally used by athletes to wrap sprains or give needed support. However, the Ace bandage wrapped about Eniwa Ichigo wasn""t for a sprain, but in some sense it was being used for support. It was the only way to help further disguise the cross-dressing cousin and push the appearance of a teen boy, and it was a painful method in her opinion. Eniwa Ichigo, fifteen years old, first year in high school, had just spent the first day of school parading around as a boy. It was all for a good cause, but that moment, Ichigo was beginning to regret agreeing to the idea in the first place. High school was tough enough to get through without the added stress of being found out as a cross-dresser and possibly getting your cousin","{""output"": ""YES""}"

I woke up with a very sharp pain in my stomach. I got up, and dashed to the bathroom. I threw up everything I had eatten the pervious night. Kyo heard me throwing up, and came, held my hair.

Zebro, who was there to get some water into Mike, told them that there had been a small group who had tried to enter the estate the night before and one of them had managed to shoot Mike with a poisoned dart. It seems they knew what they were getting into. But they were still no match for the giant dog who managed to fight off and pick them clean before collapsing under the effects of the poison.

As the song began to go at incredible pace I spun, continuing around and around before dropping into the splits with the last beat. Everyone cheered and I held out my hands to Duke and Rip who lifted me up. ""Thanks boys."" I flashed them a smile, grabbed my shoes from Rip and flung them over my back as I sauntered off the dance floor. ""Girl you got some sexy shapes and moves."" Jaye grinned at me as I joined her at a table. ""Everyone was watching you!"" ""Hmm, everyone except a certain guy who has had eyes for only you the entire day."" She blinked at me innocently, not understanding what I was talking about. Slyly I looked over her shoulder to Flint, who was talking to Breaker and Heavy but his eyes were constantly moving to look at Lady Jaye. ""Flint."" ""Flint?"" She slowly looked around then her head snapped back when her eyes met his. ""Don""t be stupid."" She blushed deeply and I grinned. ""Hell yeah.""

There were no cameras in this corridor, I had already infiltrated the security system to see where the blind spots where. There was one on the inside however I could access it via my phone with the update I had recently added. With my code breaker programme I easily broke into the office and disabled the camera for a reset, allowing me no more than sixty seconds so I got to work.

Exhaling, I quickly rushed into my room and booted up the computers, screens flashing as they switched on and I hurriedly pulled out the papers. They happened to be a written contract between the Ootori clan and the Kamizawa family. The name rang a bell and I recalled vaguely Kyoya talking to someone from that family so I did a background check and found that they were also in the same industry as my family and the Ootori clan. This wasn""t enough to prove that there was something going on behind the lines but I was more convinced than ever so I made photocopies of the contract and continued to analyse it, knowing that I would somehow have to get it back into that room without arousing suspicion.

Her grin widened as Anikara""s cheeks flared red. ""I have no idea what you are talking about!"" she scoffed indignantly.

But when it came right down to it, he was still a man; he was not a mom, he was a dad, and it was a dad""s job to protect his daughter""s virtue, not facilitate its destruction. He looked in the mirror and began touching up his face. When it was once more impeccable, he glanced at the picture of his dead wife he kept on the dresser. It was floating the rising tide of irrationality like a tiny island in the middle of a desolate ocean. ""Kotoko, what am I going to do with our baby? She""s being very naughty; she just won""t stop growing up."" He sighed and plastered a smile on his face as the unreality leaking into his world closed over his head, submerging him completely and making it a little hard to ignore. His shoulders were a little too rigid, his air of blithe ambivalence a little too forced as he bid his daughter an overly-fond farewell and headed off to work. He was glad he worked at a bar, because he really needed a drink just then. Onii-chama sighed a lot lately. He sighed when he walked through the front door and said ""I""m home.""

It was a far cry from the childhood he had been blessed with in reality. Could it now become the truth? ""Home?"" he asked, his voice trembling slightly. Lifting his hand, she placed it over her heart. ""Home,"" Samantha replied, softly. Mulder felt someone move beside him and heard a small sigh. ""Scully,"" he whispered, turning to see the woman he loved lying curled up beside him. His eyes began to moisten once more as he watched her continue to sleep. Then he looked over at his sister.

""If I leave and go with you into this starlight, and Scully remains here...how can we be..?"" He paused unable to go on. ""Together?"" Samantha asked. ""Yes,"" he replied, hoping for a solid answer, not a metaphysical one. ""Fox, she has your heart as you have hers. What better connection is there?""

He watched, with the same stupid smile he had worn earlier, as Kaoru flopped onto the further disheveled bed like a wrecked heap. Padding over to the bathroom, Hikaru tossed him a glance from across his shoulder, as he stood under the doorway. ""If you don""t hurry, we""ll be late, Kaoru."" He chided mockingly.

Suddenly, two leather-clad hands appeared on the top of it, positioning themselves for a second before they tensed as a figure heaved himself upwards. First two alert, twitching cat ears appeared, shortly followed by a shock of violet and fuchsia hair. Then, slowly, they were joined by two bright golden eyes, which carefully surveyed the area. Eyes shining in satisfaction when he saw no obvious signs of guards - which was good enough for him - the figure jumped up onto the top of the hedge with all the stealth of a cat, barely resting for a second before he began to lightly scoot along it. Feeling slightly smug, he smirked to himself and twitched his pierced tail in a self-congratulating kind of way as he continued. He suddenly noticed a guard appear around a corner in front of him, much closer than he expected, and hurriedly ducked and rolled off the hedge like a gymnast, tail held out straight for balance.

He smiled and walked quietly into the room, turning off the Monster""s, Inc. DVD playing on her television and kicking stuffed animals and toys out of the way as he made his way to her bed. Slowly, he pulled the covers up and tucked a strand of unruly dark auburn hair behind her ear, planting a soft kiss on her forehead. He wandered slowly from Exley""s room to Scully""s office and gently pushed the door open, peeking his head inside. He watched as she wrapped the presents, noting how she had turned it into a more meticulous process than it really was. Every fold was smoothed down to a crisp, perfect straight line, the tape was rubbed down to near invisibility, and every gift was topped with a shiny bow. Leave it to Scully to randomly obsess over such a mundane task, Mulder grimaced. He was glad he always got the stores to wrap his gifts for him, otherwise they would have ended up in a plastic bag from the grocery store. He stepped into the room softly and leaned against the wall. ""Need any help?"" he offered against all of his better senses.

He was concentrating on a new case and was startled when a hand came to rest on his shoulder. He hadn""t heard the door open. Mulder spun around and smiled a bewildered smile as she bent to kiss him. OXFORD, ENGLAND; August 1984 The route he ran was well memorized. He was alone, finally, a rare occurrence. Since his arrival in England all kinds of people had been trying to make him ""feel at home"". If you want to make me feel at home, he always thought to himself, just leave me alone. Mulder refused to let anyone accompany him on his morning runs, he needed the time to think about his past, his future. His life. This was the only time of the day he had to himself.

""Vaguely"" Jake replied, ""I was almost killed that night, so the end of it is a little fuzzy for me."" ""Oh poor Jake,"" Singer said with sarcasm. ""Our squad took the blame for that night. Two of us in particular were singled out for punishment. At first they didn""t have much evidence against us, but then you and your two friends Callahan and Riley decided to testify at the hearing. Your words were the nails in the coffin of my career Jake."" ""We only told the truth to that committee,"" Jake protested. ""We never meant to hurt anyone""s career."" ""Sure you didn""t,"" Singer laughed. ""Look, I""ve been shown the truth."" ""By who? Alex Krycek?"" Jake laughed back at him. ""He is not a man to be trusted, he murdered my sister."" ""Did he now, are you sure of that?"" Singer asked, raising an eyebrow. Then he quickly changed the subject, ""Do you know what happened to those other two marines, Jake?"" ""Well, I know that Callahan died in a car accident a few years back but I""ve lost touch with Riley."" ""Car Accident,"" Kyle said forming quote marks in the air. ""That""s right, a car accident. Yeah, it turns out that Riley had a tragic diving accident a couple of years ago. Jumped into the pool and his neck just snapped. Poor bastard."" ""You murdered them."" it was more a statement than a question. ""Who me?"" Kyle asked in mock horror. ""I would have killed you too but I wasn""t allowed. ""Who wouldn""t allow you to?""

A sound trickled from the apartment, foot steps, and then Lenaghan swung the door open. ""I told you-I""m sleeping."" He faltered. He didn""t look at Scully; he faced ahead, at the space behind her shoulder. ""Oh,"" he said. ""I""m sorry. I... Dana, right? Is it Dana?"" He stared behind her, his gray eyes never moving. She swallowed. His voice-it wasn""t what she remembered. It was a normal voice. It was laced with exhaustion and a sharp quality belonging to someone who didn""t take care of himself, but it was a warm, ordinary voice. ""Yes, Hi,"" she said, glancing over his features. His curling mane billowed about him, frazzled. He looked tired. He stared over her shoulder with a milky quality to his gray irises, only listening, not looking. ""You said to come see you?"" she managed. ""Right,"" he nodded and rubbed his forehead with his fingers. ""Right,"" he sighed again. ""Come on in."" He stepped away from the door, leaving it wide-open. Scully peered in, unclipping her holster, just in case. There was no sign of anyone else in the apartment. The space, made dim by drawn curtains, only revealed left-over take-out containers piled on a coffee-table. Lenaghan slumped onto the living room couch and gestured toward the arm-chair across from him, still facing dead ahead. Scully stepped in. ""Good sleep?"" he asked, in an absent fashion as Scully settled across the coffee-table. ""Yes."" She bit her lip as she registered the wall behind Lenaghan""s couch.

After realizing the school was closed for good, Nanami conceded to the fact that punishment awaited her at home. She sighed. ""Won""t the host club be worried that you""ve been gone for so long?"" the girl quizzed, seeing as how pretty much the entire campus had vacated. Nanami had momentarily given up on grieving her own problems, and acknowledged her empathetic nature that burned within her; filled with worry for other people. ""They mostly let me worry about me,"" Tamaki responded, turning back towards Nanami. ""And your family? What would they think of you being out this late?"" Her parents never worried about her.

It wasn""t uncommon for merchant families in District Four to arrange for their children to be married once they were both ineligible for the Hunger Games. Caia""s family had decided that since her chances of going to the games were very slim this year they had agreed to promise her to the son of one of the best fishermen in the district, Gregor Odair.

Rally everyone up because two of their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and friends were going to be in a pageant to the death. Death. It was the only thing that made sense to me.

I realized I had a different change of clothes on me. I was wearing an aqua shirt, jeans, and a pair of sneakers. I started to get worried as I navigated around the thickly strewn forest. I suddenly heard a moo, and after running a small distance, saw a small fence. I tried to hop over it, but there was a sort of invisible wall in front of me. I looked around and saw a gate. As I touched it, it opened in a split-second while a loud sound of a door opening played. I went in and saw a blocky looking cow. As I walked over to it, it cocked its head to side a bit, and walked toward me a bit. As I petted it a person burst of of a shed-type house and

Waving often refers to ""happy to see you,"" and trust me , I am not happy to see Katniss here in this arena with me. She needs to be safe at home in District 12, to give me an opportunity to win this and see her again! But, unfortunately that can""t be the case. I watch as her eyes narrow at something around the Cornucopia. I follow her gaze and tense up when I see it. A bow and a sheath of arrows. No Katniss, no! I scream in my head, hoping she could hear me. She""s going to go against what Haymitch told us, and run straight into the bloodbath. Can""t say this surprises me though. I mean it""s Haymitch and Katniss, you do the math. I actually want to laugh as I replay the many arguments I""ve heard between these too, they surely didn""t leave me deprived of entertainment on the train ride here. I was quickly pulled out of my thoughts as she turned in my direction, with a steady watch on those bow and arrows out of the corner of her eye. Don""t do it.

I felt good for them. Kaoru""s P.O.V. It was no wonder Mikatske was a bit off. I wonder how he would react if he saw our brotherly love routine? Man, it would be such a gag! I snickered to myself, and Hikaru shot me a confused glance. I waved him off; telling him it was just a thought in my head. We seated ourselves at the couch. Today we would get customers once more. The rest of the host club""s members all seemed to keep their eyes on us as customers piled in. Some junior and senior girls gasped as they saw us. ""No way!""

She exclaimed excitedly. ""Sit here today! These guys are just your type!"" We allowed our table to fill up, glancing at each other and shrugging. Mikatske seemed most curious. He had risen to most requests lately, so he was dying to know why our table was filling up so quickly. ""Hello ladies."" We greeted. Placing our hands in our palm at the exact same time. ""So..."" I started. ""How""s the host club been without us?"" Hikaru finished, intent on hearing an answer. One girl sighed. ""Well, I usually request Ootsuru; he""s the social type I think.

Cloud had always heard that the General was fierce combatant and harsh character. People had always told Cloud that the General was a mean man. Killed for fun, and grinned as he did it, had almost a permanent scowl on his smooth, pale features. None of that seemed true now that he had met the General in person. Cloud would be training with the General, get to know him, maybe even the real him. Maybe the cold mask seen in pictures was just a façade? Maybe...

Text2: The creature stood up straight, and I saw it as it really was: A massive iron golem. The figure in black stood in front of me was a woman, in her early 20s, dressed in a black leather coat and shorts that revealed quite a bit of leg. Her skin is black as night, and her hair is a deep purple, almost like her skin. She couldn""t be... An enderman(or woman)?! She snarled at the golem ""Fuck off, Gorn!"" I like her already. Gorn yelled ""What do you care, bitch?"" A whistling noise registers, and an iron axe flipping end over end shoots through the air past my head.

""I think I""ve figured it out."" I carefully faced away from her, looking at the beach, and smoothing my ensemble from where it had gotten wrinkled when she none-too-gently dragged me away.

He swung the blue crayon in front of her back and forth. ""You want the crayon?"" he taunted with a smirk. Kimi could feel her heart beat fast. She decided it was best to avoid the boy all together and instead moved to another coloring table. She barely sat down and started to reach for a blue crayon when once again it was snatched from her. She looked up and realized it had also been taken by Aiji. ""Ha ha I got your crayon!"" he taunted some more. Kimi tucked her head low, wishing she was a turtle and could hide in her shell. She looked around for some sort of way to hopefully get away from Aiji. Finally she just got up and moved to yet another coloring table where she tried looking for another blue crayon. ""No that""s mine too!"" Aiji sunddely shouted as he all but dive bomb on to the table to take the crayon from Kimi again. Kimi was starting to have enough to this to the point she started to cry.

And that I didn""t need to punish myself. I took a mouthful of noodles. I believed in her. She became my safety net. My oasis in a storm. I looked up at Al to see him munching on a piece of chicken.

866,"Text1: At Iron Cove, we drifted into a deep sleep... I stood on a relatively small floating island in the middle of the Void. Endermen were milling around and tall obsidian pillars with crystals on them were everywhere, towering above the otherwise desolate landscape. The ground was a yellowish green, with a honeycomb-like pattern on it. I noticed the Creeper and Enderman Generals walking towards an obsidian platform. Apparently I was invisible, as they did not notice me. As they stepped onto the platform, they waited skittishly. Just as I was wondering about what was happening, a loud roar resonated through the island and into the Void. Endermen cowered and stared into the purplish sky. A gigantic shadow was cast upon the island. With another roar, a dragon appeared and landed on the platform, its magenta-coloured eyes glaring straight at the Generals. The dragon was about six blocks tall and about twenty-five blocks in length. Its entire body was pitch black and it had a row of silver spines running along its back. Its wings were enormous and the edge was lined with a thick silver bone. Two silver horns protruded from its skull. It roared straight at the generals and they quickly bowed, fear written all over their faces. ""Have you conquered Erst?"" The dragon inquired. ""Y...Y...Ye...Yes"" The Enderman General stammered. I didn""t think that they were speaking Minecraftic (Language of Minecraftians), but their own language, so why was I able to understand them? ""Did you destroy The Chosen Hero?"" The dragon asked.

I continue down the street gingerly, almost afraid to find what is capable of singing like that and playing like the way they are. Then I see her. With her chocolate colored hair braided down her front and her gray eyes shielded from the world-they were dull and her face was angry, even though the song she was singing was meant to be cheerful. I know that I""ve seen her in this neighborhood before. People passed by her easily, ignoring her as if she was ""just another beggar on the street"". She was something more though. She was worth a lot more. I stopped in my tracks and just watched her, listened to her. Her nimble fingers picked at the guitar with ease, and her left had glided across the frets without a second thought. But her body was skinny, scarily so. Her arms were bordering on bones and her frame was dangerously thin. Was she anorexic? No, something told me otherwise. A strong feeling in the pit of my stomach told me that I should be worried about her. I took a glance at the small hat by her feet. Empty. I was disgusted that no one even bothered to share a dime or quarter. She had so much talent yet no one was giving her a second glance. I found my wallet at the back of my jeans and pulled it out. I stuffed my fingers into the slit of the wallet and pull out a note. All coherent thoughts flew away from my head and I let the money fall into her

He cheered, holding the bread up to his face and inhaling deeply. ""Ahhh, that""s good stuff."" ""Put that bread away and focus for once!"" I reached for the bread and he pulled it away defensively. ""We""re about a chunk away from the spawner I was talking about. It""s that way, but you probably can""t see it with the fog the way it is,"" I added, trying to get him to concentrate again. I could tell the thought of real food was driving him insane. The skin around his mouth was burned red from all of the poison he""d injested, and he lived in the city before this happened, so he""d spent his entire life eating cooked food. In a pinch, I was used to eating it raw, which had suprisingly trained me to not taste what I was eating in a good way. Even with that, zombie flesh was hard to stand. How did it taste to Punchy?

""Blame Beckett,"" Artemis stated simply, which was unusual for him, though he did utilize some rather wonderful alliteration. ""And why should I do that, Arty?"" the bodyguard beamed. ""Do not call me that,"" he reprimanded, his voice suddenly sharp. ""Right, I forgot,"" came the giggling reply, ""only your mother and girlfriend are allowed to call you that."" ""You""re speaking nonsense, Juliet,"" Artemis sighed. ""Holly refers to me by that nickname."" ""My point exactly - after all, much madness is divinest sense."" ""You read Emily Dickinson?"" ""Well, yeah."" Juliet shrugged. ""She has good poems."" ""Holly,"" Artemis turned to the elf in question, ""it appears that all our efforts to protect this world have come to naught."" ""Why?"" she inquired, noting that his fingers were now a mere centimeter away from her hip. He leaned closer to her, his fingers ghosting across her hip, and stage-whispered, ""The apocalypse has come - Juliet reads poetry."" ""The horror,"" she replied, her voice nearly hushed, her eyes shining with contained laughter. ""I can hear you, you know,"" Juliet drawled. ""As much fun as it is to watch you flirt, I will not allow myself to be mocked in the process."" ""Methinks the lady doth protest too much,"" Holly murmured, causing Artemis to crack a smile. ""Indeed,"" he concurred, getting to his feet and brushing nonexistent dust from his trousers. He then - due to the tiny bit of Orion screaming at him from the deepest recess of his brain - offered his hand to Holly, to help her down. ""Thanks, Orion,"" the elf laughed, accepting his unnecessary yet gallantly intended assistance, ""but I don""t think that was truly necessary."" ""My apologies,"" Artemis sighed. ""He occasionally

""Don""t worry, I won""t let you down!"" He grinned. The two continued on chatting about small random topics as the school came into view. Shinobu stopped at the school gates and, for the first time that day, felt a pang of nervousness. What the heck? He thought with confusion. This is probably the first time I ever felt nervous on a mission. Maybe it was the fact that this would be the first time he had ever stepped foot on school grounds before, considering that he had been home schooled since the day he could walk. Nowaki stopped walking ahead as he realized his friend wasn""t following him. He turned to see the young teen frozen in place at the school gate. ""You okay?"" he asked, concern showing in his voice. Shinobu snapped out of his stupor and nodded. ""Y-yeah, just...examining the school. You go on ahead."" The light haired teen urged the soon-to-be school doctor. ""Are you sure?"" He asked. Shinobu nodded. ""Yeah, go ahead!"" He gave a small smile and Nowaki nodded and waved goodbye. Drawing in a deep breath, Shinobu stepped on the grounds and looked around slowly. Groups of teens around his age were huddled in small groups or by themselves, walking around before the start of the school day. Laughter, squeals from a nearby group of girls, and some whispers from beside the teen could be heard.

Only a few years old, the Naval Memorial was a circular globe pattern set into cement and ringed with fountains and pictorial plaques. Twin masts bearing US military flags marked the breaks in the fountains ringing the central plaza. Executives, lawyers, lobbyists and government clerks sat in small clusters on the steps leading into the heart of the memorial, their sack lunches spread out between them as they ate and decided the fate of their respective worlds. They all looked the same as he did - tailored, neat, uniformly dull. He recognized the similarity even as he curled his lip at the thought of being mistaken for one of them.

Her ivory brow rippled at something she""d read, then smoothed out again. As he watched she raised her eyes from the page and gazed absently across the plaza. Plainly she was looking at the sculpture on the other side, the one of the young sailor just putting out to sea, but her thoughts were probably somewhere else entirely. Or maybe not. He wondered if that bronze figure was the reason she came here so often. Surely it brought back comforting memories of her father.

There was simply nothing else to do but to keep going somewhere, anywhere but here. A group of men came by one day. They were healthy and clean.

But there was something strange about these men and their vacant eyes, as if they saw nothing in the suffering of people around them. It seemed to her, at the the time, that they were looking for someone. In the flock of people, they snatched only at the men before shoving them away. A few grew angry and the crowd became restless, wanting answers. A knife was pulled out before the gunshots began. There was screaming and flashes of blood as people fled in any direction they could. The men stood calmly, grasping their pistols, their eyes still searching for the one they had come for. It wasn""t long before they turned and left, disappearing like ghosts into the fields.

They had flown home the next day, arriving late in the evening, so he had taken her home and asked her to take Thursday off. She had refused, determined to bounce back and get on with her life. She needed distraction anyway, always had in times of uncertainty or grief. The more she sat around at home the more she thought about things, and the more upset she got. So, instead, she had arrived at the office after a fitful night of sleep and was all but useless the entire day. The pile of used Kleenexes in the trash bin next to Mulder""s desk had turned into a mountain by the time she had left for the evening. When she had gotten home last night, she collapsed on the couch and had hardly moved since, except to use the restroom and adjust the thermostat from time to time. She had made the decision to take Friday off, but it took her over an hour to get up the nerve and energy to call Mulder and let him know. Her temperature had been fluctuating all day between 100 and 102. She was sure she""d be feeling better after a few days of rest and that a good night""s sleep, whenever she got one, would fix everything. As she

She got up and walked over to him. ""Dana, tell me... where did you go tonight?"" he said, holding her shoulders. ""I told you, I went for a walk,"" she said avoiding his gaze. He put his head down.

Well, once again thanks for giving us a hand on this case. We sure appreciate it."" Sanchez said as Mulder and Scully gathered their files and leftovers. ""Not a problem. See you in the morning."" Mulder guided Scully out the door with his hand on her lower back. The diner was a block away from the hotel so they had walked. It was cool out, and Scully was a little chilly, which Mulder noticed and put his arm around her. Scully hid a smile and leaned in to Mulder""s chest. He was warm, but she just liked being close to him. It made her feel sixteen again. They walked in silence until they got to their hotel rooms when Mulder asked if he could get some notes he left in Scully""s room. She nodded and they went into Scully""s room. ""Did you leave them in my bed?"" Mulder had flopped on the bed, tucking a pillow under his head. ""Lay down with me Scully."" Mulder had the look that Scully couldn""t resist. It was a little sad but playful. He always had a little sadness in his eyes. It pulled on her heart when he gave her that look. She loved him. She loved him with her whole heart.

I need you to check this for me,"" Vaan took out a small vial containing maroon-coloured liquid from the pocket of his slacks. Larsa had been able to get a sample of the problematical Rozarrian wine and shared some with him to pursue his own investigation. There was no guarantee that the superior scientists of Archadia could find anything useful, so they had decided to try every possible approach. Out of precaution, the sky pirate had kept a few drops stored in another vial, now safely kept in the side pocket of his leather scabbard. The rest he extended to the old man who was peering at him with curious eyes. ""No one at the palace can figure it out?"" Dalan asked him, the amused hint in his voice more apparent than before.

The rash, impatient caresses of rough fingertips on his skin, hasty tugs to the neckline of his yukata; they were all not unfamiliar to him. Indeed it was not their first happening, but the last one, he recalled, had been as far as a year ago. But this night, those careless whispers of the wind were not exactly the same.

They had slowed down, weary of the steps. Realising that she had a chance to get away, she turned on her left foot and started to run again.

I can hear every girl in District 9, including mothers, suck in a breath as Cecelia tantalizingly waves her fingers over the reaping bowl, she looks up into the crowd, her oddly colored purple eyes widening in excitement. She dives her hand into the reaping ball, rustling many slips before she yanks one out. I close my eyes then, unable to watch as she opens the slip of paper.

Unwilling to breathe in the smell of his skin laced with some ridiculous lotion, she turned her face to one side. It was incredible she could hate him more than she had just moments ago, yet there she was. He was entering her again with short, quick thrusts which stretched her without being as painful as before.

She asked solemnly, saluting her master as she did. Ignoring the usual statement from her stellar spirit, Lucy instead commanded, ""Virgo, help me! Take me to Silvia""s body!"" She quickly pointed in the direction of the prone mage that lay down in the ravine. Without bothering to answer, Virgo scooped up her master expertly and then quickly burrowed back into the earth. To Lucy it felt only as if she had been in a stuffy area with no fresh air, before she found herself once again on the surface and standing before Silvia""s immobile form after only mere moments of being underground. ""Taurus, keep him busy!"" Lucy called out, briefly watching her spirit fight the cloaked figure. He didn""t seem to do too well in close combat she noticed, Taurus was able to swing in very close with his axe, keeping the man from using his magic too much. Turning her attention back towards Silvia, she asked Virgo to prop the young girl up so Lucy could examine her more closely. ""H-hey are you alright? Wake up, please!"" Lucy pleaded, trying to gently shake Silvia""s arm that hadn""t been too burnt, whilst being mindful of her injuries. The silver-haired mage struggled to open her eyes, using her less-injured arm to reach forward and touch the side of Lucy""s face. ""W-what are you doing here?"" She asked weakly. ""What do you mean you idiot, I""m not going to leave you. My job is to protect you!"" Lucy protested loudly, trying her best to gather the smaller mage in her arms. ""No, you need to go. He""s too strong, you""ve already gathered enough information, take it to the Council!

Text2: ""Would you like to see the other Ward children now?"" The Baron asked, realising they needed to get back on topic. The boy nodded, his smile still present, although it wavered at the prospect of meeting new children. Arald stood and came around, helping the boy down from the large chair with an offered hand. Hesitantly, Horace took it, smiling when he was safe back onto his own feet. The Baron went ahead without warning, and Horace found he wanted to keep up with him. Eventually, he found a pace that kept him slightly behind the Baron. ""Sir?"" ""Hmm?"" Arald answered, glancing back and down at the boy. ""Just you see, I""ll be the best knight in Redmont."" Horace promised, his eyes bright with determination. The Lord of Redmont turned his gaze back in front of him, a small smile forming on his face. It was not the first time he marvelled at a child""s innocence. ""I""m sure you will."" He called back. Author""s Note: Don""t fret too much about child-Horace, I mean he""s nine.

It was either order some coffee I didn""t even want, or wander the streets and probably never found my hotel. Coffee it was, but the smirk on her face as she made my coffee made the latter option seem more appealing. I wasn""t surprised when I saw her dumping several packets of sugar into the coffee.

The press would surely have a field day with this, and with her failed marriage still fresh news, they were surely going to speculate the truth. She turns to the full length mirror that hangs on the opposite end wall and frowns at her appearance: her lips too red, her hair too bright, her jewelry too gaudy, her dress too tight. Her reflection is not her. Sighing again, she rips off the annoying golden heels her stylist had put her in and throws them on the sofa. Her reflection looks nothing like the woman she is, or was. It""s all a facade. The red lipstick, the white dress, the diamonds and gloves. All hiding the real Katniss.

Coach was shouting as normal but he wasn""t really listening, it was easier to drown out the noise than bother to pay attention. The sun shone down brightly and it made his armour feel heavy on his shoulders, too warm and uncomfortable for his liking. It had no use being warm in October, he could feel the cold sweat trickling slowly down the centre of his back along his spine and down into his shorts. Not able to stop himself, he shivered and itched irritably at his waist band. ""Problem, Stiles?"" Coach""s voice boomed right back into full volume as he realised he was standing at the front of the queue and was supposed to be attempting to score a goal. He continued to stand almost motionless, what was it about his armour? It was so uncomfortable it made him feel like it was on fire. Was it on fire? Surely it would hurt more if he was on fire? Unless his nerves had already fried... In a sudden spasm of movement, he furiously brushed down his shoulders, arms and legs flailing, totally uncoordinated. ""Stiles!"" Coach""s voice boomed again.

There was no fighting these girls, I was starting to think that maybe all those ingots and equipment that were on my backpack weren""t that needed after all. ""Yay!"" Cupa exclaimed cheerily. Andr held her composure, but had a big smile plastered in her face. Even Scilla held a smile. After another long walk, I entered my house with the extra 3 companions, and the moment I entered I dropped my backpack on a wall, making a loud CLANG at this. ""What do you carry in there? Lead?"" Scilla asked, her eyes pointed questioningly at me. ""Kind of."" I quickly replied. That left a quite confused Scilla in the living room of my house, so I decided to help a bit. ""But don""t worry about it."" I said, a smile on my face and my eyes focused on her. ""I""m not worried!"" She exclaimed, Her usual serious composure threw out of the window. ""Uhh Steve?""

He was becoming melancholic. And foolish; what kind of colonel he was if he spent hours to daydream instead of working on his documents? Midday barely passed and he had slacked off already. Mentally giving himself a smack square on the head, Roy whirled his chair back to face his desk. For a moment he merely evaluated the thick stack of paper on his desk. While fieldwork was not entirely his cup of tea, paperwork was much worse, especially now that he had experienced being chained to his desk to spend a sleepless night with many unfriendly papers. It was horrendous to find out that papers, despite their obviously lifeless state, could demand for more attention than any of his former girlfriends had. But Hawkeye was drop dead scary. Roy doubted he would be surprised if suddenly a bullet from the First Lieutenant""s gun made a hole on his office door just because she somehow noticed his laid-back state. Instead, it was highly possible that the picture would materialize soon if he did nothing to defeat his indolence. Releasing a heavy sigh, the Colonel reached for the paper at the top of the stack.

She fixes her hair while I sharpen my knives, hoping one of them would pierce through Glimmer""s heart. She""s been flirting with Cato a lot lately, whereas I roll my eyes but deep down I know I can feel my heart breaking. That""s why I need to stab hers. Glimmer interrupts my thoughts. ""Hey Clove,"" she says, flipping her hair, ""Is it okay if I sleep first and you keep watch?"" She smiles at me. ""Sure."" I shrug. She smiles. ""Thanks."" I watch her stand up and walk over to Cato. What is she doing? I think to myself. She lies down on Cato""s extended arm. I feel anger course through me. God I hate her. And Cato. He doesn""t even do anything about Glimmer""s flirting! He doesn""t push her away, he doesn""t kill her with his sword, nothing! And it sickens me. I know that Cato wants to be the victor as much as I do and if Marvel sends innuendos at me, he would feel one of my knives go through his chest in a matter of seconds. This is the Hunger Games. Not some dating television show! But once again something else interrupts my thoughts. Marvel wakes up, sweating. He catches his breath while I continue to sharpen my knives. ""Clove?"" he says, still trying to catch his breath. ""What?"" I ask him. ""Nothing..."" I nod, still sharpening. ""Nightmares?"" I look up. ""Nightmares?"" Marvel says, ""Of course not!""

Their escort, however, asks a few times about it, but after the glares Cato and Clove send his way, he just keeps his mouth shut. After dinner, they all go to the living room to watch the training scores, Clove and Cato sitting with notebooks and pens for notes. Glimmer scores an eight, Marvel a nine. Clove scores a ten, as well as Cato, who is pissed that he got the same score as her. The girl from 3 gets a four, and the boy a five. The girl from 4, Lillian, snags a seven, the same for the boy, Ash. The rest of the tributes average to about a five. The girl from 11 (who name, Cato learns, is Rue) gets a seven, which is surprisingly good for a girl her size and from where she originates. Her partner gets a ten (which pisses off Cato even more than when Clove got her ten). Peeta face is shown and then a flashing eight.","{""output"": ""NO""}"

But let""s just say my Grandfather Chaff was a racing man and often took my father Haymitch to the track to deliver the catered food. Grandmother Alma was a strict woman who was more worried about the bottom line and not the finish line. It took a lot of years of hard work but secret family recipes and a marriage of catering with the speedway brought the fortune my grandmother always dreamt of. With that in mind my grandfather and father could indulge in their number one pass time: fast cars and betting! Years after my grandparents passed away my father had practically ran the business into the ground. Luckily for him behind every great man is an even greater woman.

He holds out his bow and both him and Paylor get into position. In these moments, I consider taking hold of a gun myself. I spot them. Heading towards the Hospital are three young children. They do not understand that if they continue, they will be running into their deaths. I dash over to the ladder on the other side of the building and begin climbing down. The others are too occupied with their weapons that I do not bother telling them. I try to keep myself tucked beside the building as I chase after the young children. As I get closer to them, I can see how a young, dark-haired female who looks maybe eleven years old is carrying a young toddler in her arms; a young girl. Beside her is a boy who is perhaps seven or so with tears in his eyes, trying to escape. I grab onto the older girl""s shoulder and she screams. In the distance, I can see the bombs beginning to drop. ""No, it""s alright!"" I tell her. ""I""m here to help you. My name is Peeta."" Her face calms down for a moment and I can tell that she recognizes me. ""Follow me!"" I holler, leading them down another alley away from the hospital. I notice how the older girl is struggling to carry the toddler in her small arms, so I reach out my hands and she instantly hands her to me. ""Hi sweetheart. Everything is going to be okay!"" I tell this small child as I cover her head with my hand. All of these children look similar with their dark-brown hair and ice blue eyes.","{""output"": ""NO""}"

He nodded slowly and proceeded to show her to the room Mulder was in. ""I will give you a few minutes, but not too long. We need to get him ready.""

He licked them allover and started to concentrate on my left breast. He slightly gnawed on my nipple, which caused me to moan even more. Paul chuckled at my reaction and then moved to my right breast, now giving it the same attention as the other. My legs seemed to be coming to life now, because they wrapped themselves around his waist. I found myself digging my nails into his shirt as he was doing this to me.

Yue told her, Hoshiko lifted an eyebrow in confusion before she realized what was going on. The princess was letting her get out of the palace to go and help the others. She smiled and began to run ahead, the princess still holding onto her. Hoshiko brought her to a small safe house near the sacred oasis Yue had once told her about. She left the princess there, but Yue stopped her for a moment. ""Don""t go to the front lines just yet.""

Lucy screamed as she lost her footing, Edmund and Eustace doing the same, as if the floor had just disappeared out from under them.

When the entire room was filled, they swam up to where the air awaited them, seeing the walls of the room disappear as they swam in a large ocean.

It was always sunny, which is a waste because we all need to sleep. That""s how most of us spend our lives when we""re little. Just sleeping. We""re raised with a ton of discipline so we take our jobs seriously, so there is no time for fooling around. Sleeping is all we do. I ran past the huge fountain in Center Square and up the steps of the Dispatch building. It was so huge, like a mansion for work. William was at the door. ""Hiya bro! When do I get to work?"" I greeted cheerfully. I was too damn excited. He sighed and adjusted his glasses with the death scythe he had in hand. ""You""ll have to wait for it, Mortelle. You don""t just get a scythe for being sixteen,"" he said emotionlessly. I pouted as he led me in the mansion-like building. It was like a palace inside too. It was perfectly clean and literally shining. It didn""t help that everything was either white or very light blue. The walls mostly occupied windows which allowed the clear blue sky to shine in. There were tons of desks and shinigamis working as far as the eye could see. Some were walking from place to place in an orderly fashion with perfect posture and a stern face. So this is what it""s like to work. To try and copy them, I held my head and chest high to try and make my posture perfect. In reality, I looked like a kid pretending to be a soldier. William stopped at a desk with a nameplate that said ""Mortelle T. Spears"" on it and turned to me. ""Mortelle,

Text2: The Japanese man gulped before bringing the tip of his member to his mouth. At first, he placed a light kiss at the tip. He pulled back and a trail of pre-cum connected the two men. He lapped it up with his slick tongue, tasting the salty liquid. It was warm and sticky and nothing he had ever tasted could compare. Something about it had an addicting quality and made him want to taste it more. Yuuri""s small tongue darted out and tasted the tip. He slid it between the slit to taste more of Victor""s fluid. The hand that was on the base twisted around the hard organ, giving off a separate pleasurable sensation. Once he covered the tip in his saliva, Yuuri took the rest of Victor into his mouth up until his lips met his hand at the base. Victor released a gasp he had been holding in for a while and grabbed a handful of his hair. His back arched off the bed and his head was thrown back in the mattress to the extent that his neck started to ache. His breathing was much more rapid like he just finished running a marathon. ""Y-Yuuri,"" he whispered. If said man wasn""t paying attention, the sound of his name could have easily been masked as another exhalation. Hearing how the man was gasping beneath him made him feel powerful like he was actually doing something right. He smiled around the cock in his mouth and took him in deeper, feeling the tip hit the back of his throat. In that moment, he had never been more grateful for not having an active gag reflex. His tongue scraped the underside of his dick, acting like a soft wet cushion as it glided in and out of his person.","{""output"": ""YES""}"

When Mulder turned his attention back to his driving, he saw that they had been drifting off the road. ""Are you trying to kill us or are you that blinded by my hair?"" Scully said. Scully quieted down and there was silence in the car again. ""Why don""t you ever call me Dana?"" she asked. ""It feels weird. I""ve never called you Dana anyway. Guess I""m not used to it."" ""You could try you know. We""re married now. Do you honestly believe that normal couples walk around calling each other by their last names?"" ""I can""t imagine calling you Dana all the time. And who ever said we are a normal couple?"" Mulder paused. ""If you are so picky about me calling you Dana, then why don""t you ever call me Fox?"" ""Because I don""t want to,"" Scully replied. ""Unbelieveable,"" Mulder muttered. ""Well who in their right mind would ever name their child Fox?"" ""My mom!"" Scully shrugged. ""Well she must have been high on morphine when she named you.""

Monica agreed. ""Doggett, I barely know you."" ""True."" He replied. We continued easy conversation for the remainder of lunch. When it came time for auditions, we all walked over to the auditorium. The auditions were being held in alphabetical order, so it was Doggett, Mulder, Mona, then myself. POV: Walt I was almost done with auditions, I had reached the 16+ year olds. Oh joy. So far, only four students have been selected for the advanced section of the camp. It""s a bad year. The first of the 16+ year olds was a boy called John, or as some called him, Doggett. It was his fifth year, so I already knew he would be advanced and offered the teaching position. Out of courtesy, I listened to his guitar piece and gave him some pointers once he was finished. The second auditionee was John Fitzgerald Byers. I would""ve put him in advanced, but Doggett was better. A girl named Diana came in on the clarinet. I didn""t even know people played this fucking instrument anymore, much less that its allowed in the camp. She wasn""t that good, either. I put her in intermediate because I felt bad. The next person relevant to this story was Alex Krycek. He was just weird, I mean he played the viola. Who even plays the viola? He was mediocre, so I put him down as an intermediate student.

It was always there, lurking on the edge of her sub-conious, waiting for the right moment to pounce. The middle of a case wasn""t the right time for them to come however, especially with feelings escalating between herself and Doggett. Recently she had found his presence slightly intoxicating, and just being around him made her have feelings that she hadn""t had scince her last ex-boyfriend years ago, feelings that were purely sexual. So, it didn""t help that when she saw the victim she started crying, and then Doggett, in a rare show of tenderness, pulled her away from the body and asked her what was the matter. His hand had rested lightly on her back, and between the painful memories of her past, and the intoxicating closeness of her partner, she didn""t know what she was feeling anymore.

Unaware that her mouth was hanging open, Scully continued to observe Mulder""s back and shoulder blades twist and adjust to the weight of her television. She was in awe. ""Uh, Scully?""

Her face is washed clean, skin pale and shadows bloom her eyes. But there is just a little more of a spark in her eyes, a little colour in her cheeks, and her hair is shorter, pulled up into a lazy ponytail.

Closing her eyes, she wrapped her arms tightly around the same man she knew was going to hurt her. A shudder shook him as she surrendered in his arms and he inched his throbbing shaft into her incredible warmth, uncertain how much pain he was going to cause her and desperate to lessen it. The time her had taken with her had eased her passage, and he felt her silken warmth tightly sheathing him, expanding to encase him. Twisted into knots of desire, his heart beating painfully, he eased himself into her until he finally encountered the fragile barrier. He withdrew by inches and shifted forward again, and then withdrew, poised to breach the barrier, desperate to bury himself within her, hating the pain he was going to cause her.

Her greatest fear was that the Tree Pigs would attack her and break her lines. That fear came to light on a quiet evening when a small Tree Pig group of soldiers attacked the north wall (the village was fortified by a short stone wall about four feet high surrounding the village). The Tree Pigs were repelled and the wall remained intact. Another attacked came on the south wall, it too was repelled. Then the Tree Pig army was seen marching towards them. The defenders stood ready and ImmortalKyodai took her personal guard and a small troop of Lake Chickens and began to fortify the village itself.

Allied generals, Lu Meng thought with mounting despair, should not have the desire to kill each other. One day must have passed - according to Lu Meng""s agonized sense - when eventually Ling Tong crossed his arms defensively in front of his chest, watching Lu Xun returning to his seat with narrowed eyes. None of them said anything more but Meng thought that it would be safer if he blocked the path Ling Tong""s vindictive pebbles had to take in case the prankster decided to try Lu Xun""s patience once more. He was still standing there when the door leading to the room was pushed open from the other side and their commander walked in. The frown on his handsome face deepened when he noticed the situation he was in. ""Is something happening?"" ""No, Sir,"" Lu Meng responded automatically, fully aware that his answer was far from adequate but also wiser than trying to lie to the astute strategist. Zhou Yu eyed him suspiciously, but decided not to pursue the subject. However, a fleeting look he gave to a certain nunchaku-user was enough to assure Lu Meng that the commander had a better - if not correct - grasp of the situation. ""Very well then,"" Zhou Yu said as he positioned himself at one end of the large table in the middle of the room. ""The lord will arrive late so let us just begin the meeting."" The situation was indeed dire, Lu Meng found out a while later after their commander informed them of most recent developments. More Wei soldiers were arriving through land and water, swelling the astronomical number of the

Roy knew he was expected to understand. And so he did. After taking the bundle of report from Al""s outstretched hand, he quickly dismissed the younger Elric, expecting the other to be as pissed as he was at the situation which none of them could change and soon leave him alone to deal with his anger in peace. It took him one full minute to look up again and find the build of armor still standing resolutely on his place, small white eyes staring straightly to the paper on his hand. ""Colonel,"" Al began, a flare of hope flashing in that one short title. ""Is there any development in the investigation of Nii-san""s case?"" To answer seemed very difficult for Roy, but he eventually managed a short explanation, if a bit inadequate. ""I have sent a man from the investigation division to go to Northest Town but nothing of importance he has reported."" ""Oh."" Had Al could move a muscle of his stiff metal face, the Colonel would have seen a heartbreaking crestfallen expression. Roy studied him for a moment, noticing the straight posture the younger brother still maintained despite the downcast of his eyes, and decided that it would be rather rude to try sending him away once more while he himself was still the accused rapist of his brother.

I was also close to a forest, so wood would not be a hard priority to fulfill. I walked over to the trees and started to punch them. I obtained the wood, and once I got a large amount I turned it into wooden planks for my house. My house was basic, a ten by seven by four made of oak wood. Then, I used my leftover wood to make sticks, a crafting table, and some tools. I dug a little hole in the ground to get cobblestone for a furnace. Once I got enough, I returned to the surface. It was nearing sunset, so I went over to the sheep and got its wool. I ran over to my house and made a bed. I set up my furnace and put some logs in for charcoal. I placed my bed down on the floor and went to sleep. Tomorrow I will find a cave. I promised to myself. I fell asleep and started to dream. But it wasn""t a nice dream. It was a nightmare.

Now she had the dread of the inspectors suddenly turning up and finding something wrong with the morgue combined with the real fear that they would arrive to find Sherlock beating up one of the corpses or seeing what happened to glow sticks if you x-rayed them.

It wasn""t until she""d muttered his name in that sweet, musical voice which had captured his heart at the castle did the prince look up and meet her gaze. ""I""m relieved to see you made it out safely,"" he whispered, his dark eyes, just moments before filled with melancholy, were flooded with a new emotion; concern. Before he could reach to grasp her hand, Caspian was interrupted by the beaten and battered forest army that had been recruited, and depleted in a matter of days. Leading the way across the field was the kings and queens of old; High King Peter, King Edmond, Queens Lucy and Susan. When the rest of the soldiers had bowed before the supposed saviors of Narnia, Lyana looked up skeptically. King Peter appeared most confused by the action. ""Are you not from Narnia?"" He asked her curiously. ""I am very young, in regards to native Narnians, but I do not see why I must bow to you. My duty is to protect the forest, and you have destroyed its keepers,"" she indicated the exhausted attack force before them. Peter was taken aback by the statement. No one before the catacomb had even noticed that the young girl was there until she spoke out. When she did though, there was a sweeping admiration among the warriors. ""It was a mistake to attack the castle,"" Caspian hissed at Peter, after both the angered prince and the High king had separated from the pack. ""The only

Odette Leith, District Four. Fay Amaris, District Nine. Ezra Zinnia, District Ten. All deaths will be based on realism, story arcs and whether or not the submitter is reading the story. Obviously, reviews let me know this, and if said submitter chooses to not review, I have no idea if they""re reading the story, and therefore, am more inclined to keep other tributes over said submitter""s tribute. Each decision is painstakingly hard but must be done. Everyone knew the odds when they created a character. I would hope you stick around, but if not, I understand. My main apologises go out to - you are with me, happygoluckyclover and DramaticGleek. You guys kept reviewing, I know that, but I didn""t know where to take your tributes in all honesty. Fay was precious, but an underdog. Ezra was sweet, but not a fighter. Odette was angry, but lost in the background. I still loved them all, and I hope you stay with the story. I would love for you to answer a specific question I have for each chapter! Your thoughts on the surviving tributes and those who died? And, of course, a general review on my writing? It""s invaluable! My chapters will be shorter here than in the Capitol. Six POV""s a chapter means less writing overall. But, I think this was good enough. Sorry for the delay... I did mention that this would be hard, and it was. I had no clue who to kill so I literally went with who I haven""t got a storyline for. I hope everyone understands that.

Aching limbs and numbness was a human feeling, something that vanished rapidly once one returned to the Spirit World. As Loke sat up and rubbed his eyes from beneath his glasses tiredly, he reflected upon the nostalgic feeling he had. Loke glanced over to see Lucy snuggled up comfortably against the side of Aries. Memories of last night flooded in and it took Loke a while to register that Lucy had requested both himself and Aries to keep her company. His hazel eyes settled upon his fellow spirit, finding it unsurprising to find her wide-awake and staring at Lucy""s ceiling. Not bothering to move as to disturb Lucy, Aries whispered quietly, ""I""ve never fallen asleep in the human world."" She raised a hand to her face shyly, knowing Loke was observing her. ""I couldn""t do it, it was too unfamiliar."" She admitted timidly. ""Lucy is lucky that you were watching over her."" Loke told her quietly, trying to cheer the Ram up.

Hopefully the next ones will come out soon. - Mae. Chapter Twelve: || Discussions || Kaoru found himself oddly at peace as he trudged up the stairs to his manor. He had just finished attending an esteemed fashion show in a nearby town and was in good spirits. As much as the twins desired to delve back into the fashion world, Kaoru""s time spent with Haruhi had sparked some ideas on commoner fashion. With cheaper materials he could make similar and cheaper designs of his own work to sell to the commonfolk, which in his opinion would be a fantastic investment. Of course Hikaru and he would primarily be involved in fashion for the rich and elite, but Kaoru hadn""t liked how shaken their world had become when the threat of losing their father""s company had loomed over them. He was beginning to see that by creating two different labels, (although ultimately linked) he would be securing a better financial future. Added to the fact that he had run his idea past Kyoya, (for management advice, not fashion), he was very confident. All in all, he could barely prevent the smile that spread across his face as he handed his thick coat to his butler. Passing through the main hallway, the younger Hitachiin contemplated stopping by the kitchens for something to snack on. However he heard the faint sound of a girl""s laughter coming from one of the smaller lounge rooms, and decided to investigate that instead. As he rounded the corner, he heard a girl exclaim, ""You know you""re very lucky, Haruhi. After all, you could""ve ended","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The door looked a lot like all the other doors around it except for one thing. Derek was leaning against it. ""What""s going on?"" I demanded.

Text2: When did he come to mean so much to me? When did his well-being come to be so much more important then my own? From the day I entered the academy, I heard the stories of the dark-basement dwelling denizen. Tales of crazy, Spooky Mulder, king of paranoia. And, like every other new recruit, I fell into listening to them, but never really considering them as fact. Not until that day Blevins called me in, and told me I would be working with the myth himself. I had heard the stories, knew some by heart, and now I would find out if they were true. And, at first, they seemed to be. Until that second night in Oregon. I ran to his room, half-naked and panicked. I sought him for reassurance, and he was there, comforting me gently. And, he sought me for a confidant. I learned the truth that night. From that day forward, whenever I heard a whispered cautioning, a sympathetic or patronizing comment, I just smiled politely and let then go on believing in their myths. I knew the truth. The darkness that was all that anyone else saw, the shroud that hid him from all prying eyes, it has a light. I had seen it. It was buried deep, but it was there, in his gentle voice and touch. And in his eyes. God, those eyes. With their beautiful, ever-changing shades of green-brown. How they""re always so wide and excited, especially when he has a theory about a case. An outlandish idea or plan that would be considered by anyone else as a free ticket to the loony bin.

I looked at the clock through blurry eyes, and noticed it read 9:30. Awesome, I had not hit snooze; I completely turned my alarm off. I looked up to see Mulder standing in my doorway. ""Hi, Mulder, "" I said with my morning voice. ""Good Morning, Sleeping Beauty. I had thought you would be awake by now. I am sorry."" I do not know why I was so tired.

Katniss raised a shaky hand towards the ribbon, and Glimmer looked expectant and anxious at the same time. When she pulled on the ribbon, it loosened up from being in a bow, to being a loose piece of fabric hanging onto the ceiling. Katniss then tugged even harder on the ribbon, and pulled it towards her. Suddenly, the square the lines made on the ceiling came off being held onto the rest of the ceiling by latches, and golden colored rope stairs fell from it. Katniss was gaping, her eyes wide as well as Glimmer. Katniss climbed up the rope stairs and found herself in a terrace that stretched from one side of the house to the other. It had thousands of pots and bushes filled with roses, primroses and katniss roots. It had white, wooden floors and there was a round pool with a white marble path and silver railings that arched into a bridge over the water and lead to a medium sized cabin in the middle of the water, like an island. Katniss gaped, not believing that this could be real, especially with the view of the lake, under the star-filled sky. Everything was lit by lamps, which gave off a sweet and dim light. Katniss wondered while she walked around with Glimmer holding hands, how beautiful everything was. Everything was just splendid, beautiful and breathtaking. She and Glimmer walked toward the cabin, silently. Inside the white, wooden cabin, there was a living room with a fireplace, a kitchen a the end, a dining room and two doors; one lead to a dark green, colored bedroom and the other

Unlike most other muttations, however, dabbitogs were made for pleasure. They are a mix of a bunny and a dog, and so look like extremely furry toy poodles with stick uppity ears. They are extremely fast and loyal. Everywhere I look, I see happy people, relaxing and soaking up the sunlight. And here I am, trapped in this fancy limo prison, being taken off to fulfill my death sentence. The train station is once again packed with reporters when we get there. They shout questions at us as we step onto the train. Taro, Lupe, and Regilus follow us on- Taro crying softly. My heart melts at this sight- so she really did care for us, all this time.

Spread the fanfic! :D -Alex On the mannequin was a practically beautiful dress. It was orange and black, little black jewels woven into the fabric wherever the black pattern was. The pattern was made to look as if it was a monarch butterfly; I remember how every year there was a flood of butterflies that visited us. I""m not exactly sure if it was normal, but all in all it""s beautiful. The dress itself was short, the bottom part all ruffley. It was strapless, and the shoes that went along it were just simple ballet flats. It was beautiful. And to top it off, there was a pair of butterfly wings for me to wear with the dress. I turned to Syra in astonishment. ""It""s... beautiful. How did you know that butterflies came to our district? What does Bates"" look like? Is he going to be a butterfly as well?"" Syra looked bored with me. ""You stupid girl, I used to live in District Eleven. I moved to the Capitol when I was three. This was before the Hunger Games started, so we were allowed to move freely.

""Come on, it isn""t that bad right so now let""s see where Yuki is..."" Cain grinned; he was proud about the fact that he caught a Digimon with his sport bag and he was also curious about how Yuki would react if she were to see a real Digimon. After all, he was certain that Yuki was related to Takeru Takaishi, which would mean that she also must know about Digimon and that""s why he wanted her to see Moonmon so badly. ""Isn""t that bad? It stinks of old shoes in here and..."" Moonmon didn""t finish the comment when she felt Cain hitting the bag to signal that she should be quiet, and moments later Moonmon heard other voices.

After Xephos and Honeydew had gone, he""d thrown himself headfirst into his work again. There were several projects he was intent on, but obviously Beta took precedence. Only one specimen remained. Lalna had felt more troubled with the passing of each failed ""embryo"". In the beginning, the death of a cluster of cells hadn""t been too emotionally trying, but the most recent had looked like a ten year old child. When its brain stopped showing activity and the heart stopped beating, Lalna felt a sense of personal loss. He chided himself of course, and tried harder to remain scientific, but it was challenging. Lalna conducted his routine daily check up on the final specimen. Upon the death of the other, Lalna had conducted a procedure to manually keep the heart beating via regular electrical impulses. It was intended as a safeguard in case the specimen""s heart went into distress. There was nothing Lalna could do if there was a fundamental flaw in the specimen""s brain, but luckily that seemed more unlikely everyday. If something was going to impact its chances of survival, it would have become apparent already. Lalna estimated the specimen would come to term in about a week. After recording the statistics, he turned on his tape recorder to better document other findings and procedures done over the course of the day. Beta log, week three, day five.....

Somewhere outside the plush and ridiculously isolated surroundings of his current location lurked the crowded chaos that was the morning train. He""d been cycling the thought about his head from the very instant he""d gotten to Clapham Junction and realised that not only would he be riding first class for literally the first time in his life, but that his only other companion in the carriage would be Guthrie. Not that he was complaining, mind you, a train journey without a sweaty arm pit right next to your nose and an actual seat was the holy grail for a long term commuter such as himself, after all, but reserving the entire carriage smacked of upper class snobbishness.

Apparently the stain on the letter had actually been the composite of nectar, pollen and other trace elements that bees secreted as waste, which meant that whoever had left the print had a high likelihood of being a beekeeper.

""Yeah, but also have u ever heard of an amulet made of gold that has a ruby attached to it? They were gonna use it for something. And when I tried to take it they nearly killed me for it"" Suze said. Father Dominic""s face suddenly grew pale and grim. ""Did this amulet look very old, like antique old? And did it have diamonds around the ruby?"" Suze and Paul glanced at each other. ""Yes"" they both said in unison. Father Dom suddenly bent over to open the bottom drawer of his desk. He pulled out a thick black book that looked to be older than he was. ""Your not the first mediator I""ve met Susannah and this book is records of past experiences and notes from previous mediators that have come before you,"" Father Dominic explained, Suze noticed his hands were shaking visibly, ""and there is a record in here of an amulet.

I had this weird dream that Sleepy admitted his true feelings for me and then we kissed. I looked at the clock. Naturally I was late. Again. Feeling angry that nobody had woken me, I scrambled out of bed and started to search frantically for something to wear to school. I wouldn""t have time for a shower. There was a soft knock on the door. I looked down to check if I was decent then said ""what?' Sleepy opened the door and came in carrying a tray. Breakfast? Ready made? For me? By my step brother? Maybe that dream wasn""t such a dream after all. My heart started pumping. ""Hey beautiful"" Jake said smiling shyly. This statement only confirmed my suspicions.

He turned around just as I barreled headlong into him. None of my papers fell, thank God, I would never have gotten them back. I was still fairly embarrassed, and before I could regain my bearings and look up at his face, apologizing a thousand fold, I heard him utter a single word: ""Scully."" Only one person still called me by my last name. I looked up into his twinkling hazel eyes and felt myself lose control. My lips formed the syllables of his name, but my voice didn""t come with it.

976,"Text1: The cold night air nipped at Corbett""s cheeks as he sprinted away from the battle nearby. With only two other tributes left, he knew he would be forced to fight sooner rather than later, but he was still without a weapon and near exhaustion from the mountain""s avalanche a few days earlier. And after noticing the gash in his shoulder bleeding again, he figured he was in no condition to fight. Heavy flurries of snow were falling by the time he reached a patch of shrubs and lichens that could be considered a passable shelter. In the past thirty-two Hunger Games in existence, there had never been an arena like that of the thirty-third. A wide stretch of tundra with virtually no protection against the cold surrounded the Cornucopia. There was a large, snowy mountain that stood in the way of a pine forest- the only source of wood to build a fire. From the first day, it was blatantly obvious their puffy coats weren""t enough to ensure survival. More tributes had perished on the journey over the mountain than during the initial bloodbath at the start of the games. The terrain was rocky, dangerous, and filled with predators. Wolves camouflaged with their white fur successfully killed many of the unsuspecting. Mammoth bears inhabited any caverns in the rocks. Food was scarce and the smaller animals had a tendency of stealing any pathetic amount of nutrition you managed to get your hands on. It took well over a week for those who endured it to reach the other side. Corbett himself was very mangled after the journey. His ally from District 6 had even died during a blizzard while they were scaling the peak. Bundled up together in the thick blanket they""d snatched from the Cornucopia, Corbett felt his partner""s

The rest of the afternoon we spend it doing cupcakes and cakes, although when Jonas asks why we""re working so much, Peeta says ""because there""s a lot of work"", but Jonas says we don""t, that the Bakery is already closed. Peeta tells Jonas to go away and that he""s not helping and I know then that Peeta is lying. I don""t say anything, though. It""s about to get dark when Peeta comes up with a story that the woman who owns the Flowers shop has a daughter whose birthday is tomorrow and he tells me how he""s got a lot of work to do and how he doesn""t want me to stay here so late because he""s going to take a while. Wow, he""s a bad liar. He tells me to go home, and that he""ll get there in a few hours.

CHAPTER THREE fear is uncertainty""s lover Mara hasn""t spoken to me since the day of the Reaping, and come to think of it, I am fairly certain she hasn""t even looked at me since then. The guilt of not Volunteering for her still lingers on my shoulders when I wake up in the morning, until I go to bed late in the evening; just staring at the pale ceiling, trying to make sense of my decision. For as long as I can remember, I have known Mara and Harpee, some way or another. They were there when I first started school. They hadn""t paid much attention to me until I made the front and introduced myself, since I was a lonely, little girl. For whatever reason, they adopted me into their little group, and more so than that, they clung to me like leaches on skin. Even after the years they let me in we were together. We often would giggle during school. They would go with

My hand at my womanhood went further down, slipping a finger into my tight opening and feeling my muscles clench around it. It was naughty, something so exotic but I just couldn""t stop. I added another finger, gasping as I plunged them hastily in and out of my throbbing vagina. My back was arching as the parts of my body outside the water glistened with sweat. Now what would this feel like if it were Peeta, strong yet gentle hands plunging.. I couldn""t bare it. I barely muttered his name, flexing my hips up and against my hands as I climaxed into it, so prematurely. The warm wave of juices fell over my fingers as I pumped them in a few more times, shivering with the thrill of getting myself off to the boy with the bread. The knot in my stomach no longer called my name and I was feeling better - the need and hunger was gone and I could face the day... Or so I thought. I was just barely out of the shower before I heard Peeta""s footsteps downstairs. I could tell his by anyone else""s, due to his amputated leg being a little heavier. I threw on some clothes again and ran my hands through my damp hair before opening the door to head down the stairs, only to spot him staring up at me with concerned hues.

""Oh, and look what I brought!"" Yuki grinned, pausing in her mad dash around the room to pull something out of her hand bag. It was a little bunch of green leaves with some bright red berries bound in the middle, ""Mistletoe!!!"" Kagome went white as a sheet. ""What?!"" The three girls looked up at the panic in Kagome""s voice. ""Oh, gosh, Kagome, are you all right?"" Ayume gasped. ""Do you feel faint?"" Eri asked, concern coloring her voice.

""First kiss!"" the other two squealed. They all three started digging through her stuff again with a new found fervor, pausing only to order into the shower. As the hot water washed over her naked form, her mind raced and she tried to take stock of just what was going on. Hojo was coming to the Christmas party and Yuki had mistletoe. It didn""t take a fortune teller to see her current future. She loved her friends, but those three could have built Rome in a day if it had to do with a cute boy. If they had it in her head that she was going to kiss Hojo under the mistletoe tonight, nothing short of Armageddon would stop them from making it happen. Why was

Text2: Color drained further from her face when she remembered that the blonde was waiting for her to pay and leave, but all Haruhi had in her wallet was two-thousand yen, an old baseball card, a bobby pin, and a ball of lint. Yeah, that last one was kind of embarrassing... ""Miss?"" The blonde prompted impatiently. Haruhi laughed nervously. ""Uh, you see, I""m not the one who-"" ""Charge it to this."" Hikaru""s hand appeared from behind her holding a red and black credit card. Casting a sideways glance up at him, Haruhi noted that he looked considerably upset. Had her comment about the weather really angered him that much? The girl hesitated for a moment before taking the card from his fingers, ran it through a card reader, and then her eyes nearly fell out of her head. ""Y-you""re one of the Hitachiins?"" she barely stuttered out. It was obvious that Hikaru was trying his best not to snap at her rudely as he plucked his card out of her hand and slid it into his back pocket. ""That""s right."" He looked down at Haruhi and his gaze softened. ""Let""s go, Haruhi."" He turned on his heel, leaving little time for Haruhi to grab all three bags of their food and catch up with him. When she was an arms length behind him she said, ""Sorry for upsetting you so bad back there. I didn""t mean what I said about the weatherman thing."" Hikaru opened the back door and Haruhi set their bags down on the floor. Something about his expression made her wonder if it had been something else that had happened back there that had made him so upset, but he simply nodded. Then he smirked and asked, ""So can I drive?"" He held his hands out playfully for","{""output"": ""YES""}"

He hadn""t made such a big fuss in any of the other places I had lived. I mean it""s not like he completely followed me everywhere. No he only appeared when I was either moving or I sort of needed a hug...or maybe even a kiss and when he was there he never even saw Jesse--my daughter-- which could be a potential problem with this house. He had never been there to see me make my great escapes through other windows. By now I was the climbing through a window expert. Jesse opened his mouth to say something but quickly shut up when he heard someone else call your name. ""Hey mom?"" Jesse called out. One of the few times she actually used the word ""mom"". I quickly unfolded my arms and went to my closet as if I had just been taking my time picking out another outfit. Which wouldn""t have been unusual. ""Suze were you talking to someone?"" She asked through my doorway. I looked at her and frowned. Just another simple lie would do the trick. I shook my head ""No, but I""m just about to go."" I replied pretending that I was looking straight through Jessie""s well built abs. ""Is there anything you need when I""m out?"" I asked. She looked at me straight through the cloud of air that was Jesse. She looked as if she was thinking hard about that. She shook her head. ""Ningunas Gracias"" She replied shaking her head. What had I done? I had turned Jesse into a Spanish speaking monster that I couldn""t understand.

The Gunmen looked at her like she was kidding. She just made fun of their lifestyle. ""You sure Gambit? This Tequila stuff better be as good as you say it is."" Frohike said curiously. ""I""m sure as Frohike""s love for Scully."" Gambit smiled. Frohike nodded and twisted the cap of his bottle and took a swig. Then his eyes bugged and he crashed to the floor. ""Oh my god! Frohike? You ok? What is in this stuff Gambit?"" asked Byers as he freaked out over Frohike. Gambit got up and took the bottle and cap from Frohike""s hands and put the cap back on. ""It""s the good stuff.

It""s time for breakfast."" She nodded her head and came with me. We didn""t really talk that much I guess we were both uncomfortable with each other. We also met Johanna and Annie on the way.

Her muscles wouldn""t move. Her eyes floated around. It wasn""t just that her body felt weak, her mind did too. A moment of clarity told her that they must have given her something to dull her senses. Darkness of the mysterious leaky corridor fed into darkness of a hollow room. Flames danced on candlewicks, for a minute she was mesmerized by them. The whole room looked like a puzzle from her vantage point. There were walls, a floor, chairs, a table, but she couldn""t put it all together in one coherent image. In her drug-induced stupor she barely realized she was being picked up before her head slumped backwards. Pain in her ankles told her she was on her feet. Hoarse breaths escaped her.

The man studied her face, nodding to a shadow in the corner of the room, ""There""s no helping you."" Chains clamored.

Whether there were two voices or five Pandora couldn""t tell. ""Bring her over."" She tried to push the man away but it did no good.

Text2: Erin is a seven teen year old girl who is mortal, unlike her parents who were both pure blood. No one knew why she turned out mortal, it was a mystery to everyone and she was most eager to find out. She lived like a vampire and all her friends were vampires. The only thing was she weren""t a vampire. Other than that, there was no difference. Erin was the only girl playing football with the guys, she loved it. She loved the wind passing her as she ran and the feeling of beating the boys at their own game. Plus, she didn""t like sitting besides she screaming fan girls of the football players. The two centres on the opposite side started. Max and Jet. Max was Erin""s older brother and had light brown hair with green eyes and Jet had jet black hair with the darkest brown eyes. They ran towards the goal Erin was defending. Max and Jet passed all the vampires, passing to each other. Erin quickly ran and intercepted the pass from Jet to Max. She kept running until the goal and scored. '""That was your fault Jet!'' Max joked '""Erin""s charms must be distracting right?'' '""Nah, the sun was in my eyes""' '""Funny when the sun was behind you ey-ey?'' Mick laughed, he was on Erin""s team and one of the older vampires playing. Max laughed '""Don""t ever touch my sister.

She couldn""t lie to herself anymore. There was a reason she wanted to come to Destiny Island, and, as if on cue, that reason stalked up behind her and kissed her on the lips. ""What""s with the huffy sigh?"" Riku asked, a smile gracing his beautiful face. Xion had opened her eyes in surprise when he kissed her, but she immediately relaxed when she saw his familiar face. The blindfold covering Riku""s eyes always lent him an air of mystery- well that, and Xion really didn""t know too much about him. But despite everything, Xion loved Riku with all of her nonexistent heart. ""You""re thinking too much."" He smiled gently as she sat up and turned to face him. He caressed her chin with a gloved hand, and kissed her lips once again. One of the many things she loved about Riku- he always knew what to say. He somehow always seemed to know how she was feeling, even though he couldn""t see her. He was surprising, amazing, and interesting; everything she could ever ask for. And despite his knowing that she was a nobody, Riku didn""t seem to mind it at all. ""It seems like you could use a break,"" Riku said, taking her hand and holding it in between his two much larger ones. Changing positions, he slid down next to Xion until they were lying side by side, and soon after he continued to kiss her compassionately. Xion""s mind felt like it had melted, and she didn""t have a complaint in the world about it. Riku was the perfect medicine right now, and she couldn""t thank

Text2: There it was. Not more than a few feet in front of her. It looked just as terrifying as she imagined it would: deep, sunken in, black eyes; a dark brown fur that was dirty with blood and gore; and a haunting frown that sent shivers down her spine. She thought teddy bears were supposed to smile, not frown! The knife in its hand was huge compared to its small body size. She couldn""t help but wonder where it had gotten a hold of it. She gulped, imagining the little thing cutting her up with that gigantic knife. It simply stared at her, its black eyes never moving. She shivered involuntarily and took a step back, wanting more than anything to get away. But something held her back- a sense of morbid curiosity. As Duck took her hesitant step back, the Beddy Tear took a step forward, its knife gleaming in the moonlight. She looked up; just now realizing that she where she was. The darkness obscured a lot of her surroundings, but she soon saw that she was surrounded by trees. The only place in town that could get this dark at night was the woods. She was in the woods. At night. With the Beddy Tear right in front of her, intent to kill. And just to make things creepier: there wasn""t even a full moon. It was barely a crescent moon, which meant it was nearly impossible to see anything. Great. Just great. As the Beddy Tear stared at her, minutes seemed excruciatingly long. She stood as still as possible, as if she was facing a wild animal. Maybe if she didn""t move, it would eventually get bored and leave? She was dangerously unsure of what to do.

He was afraid that he might hurt her even more. He was afraid that his life would be crumbling to pieces, once he touches her, and finds out that his worse fears had come to pass. But still, he wanted to. He gathered up the courage to hold her. He picked her up by the shoulders and placed her head on his lap. He wiped his tears with his sleeves in the slight hope that she might open her eyes and he doesn""t want to show her his tears. He forced a smile on his lips as he shook the lifeless girl in his hands. ""Momo...open your eyes...I""m here now...Nobody""s going to hurt you..."" he commanded.

""Oh? What""s that?"" he heard her exclaim before he caught up to her. ""It""s a skateboard, Miss."" Was the dreaded answer. Bansai froze. Did Miwa""s eyes just glint at him evilly when she turned back to him with an equally wicked grin on her face? Later that afternoon, Miwa and Bansai were just walking around the streets of Kabuki-chou, watching the bars come to life for the coming of the night. ""It""s just like Yoshiwara, I guess.""

""Sure."" She got out of the car, making sure she had the keys, and locked the doors. She wasn""t worried about William wandering off, but she was downright panicked that someone would try to take him off her hands. Marita hadn""t planned this far beyond getting him out of the house, and she certainly hadn""t expected them to beat her there. She was lucky William was alive at all. Marita paid for a twenty ounce Coke and a bottle of Evian. It was good to stretch her legs; Emporia to Wichita on I-35 wasn""t the worst stretch of road or even the longest, but it had been a long night. She hadn""t bothered with cruise control, instead pushing the car to eighty whenever there was a break in traffic. It was possible, even likely, that she had been followed. Ideally, Marita wanted to turn south and head for Mexico, but for now she would stick to heading west as planned. In fact, she needed to buy a map, and added one to her purchases. Running to Mexico like a common criminal hiding from the feds. She suppressed a bitter laugh. It wouldn""t be the first time she had had to hide, change identities. She looked out the window as the cashier counted her change. From where she stood, if she squinted, William looked like Mulder. He had looked that way when she found him, and she thought it had to be the smoke and her irritated eyes playing tricks on her.He looked like Mulder must have when his sister was abducted, and that thought made Marita

Within no time at all, she reached the blaze rod and quickly enveloped it, swallowing it into her molten depths. Seconds later, there was no indication that the rod had existed at all. The cube looked up at her master hopefully. Jomei sighed, and, tsk-tsking to himself slightly, casually walked up to the creature. ""Vala, you""re not supposed to eat it, you""re supposed to fetch it."" The children laughed as the Vala averted her gaze from her master""s in shame. Jomei smiled as he reached down and pat the top of her head. Contrary to popular belief, magma cubes were not burning to the touch on the outside- merely warm. It was only the inner core of their bodies that is hotter than lava. ""Don""t worry, you""re not in trouble. Just spit it out, alright?"" The pet jumped eagerly at this opportunity to please her master, and she immediately spit out the rod through the side of her body. Although it was slightly steaming, it was intact. After checking to see if it had cooled down enough to pick up, Jomei took the rod and placed it back in the pocket of his black jeans. The group of kids clapped happily, jumping up and down and cheering. The prince had been at this for about an hour now, and the children never found it to get old. Although widely regarded as a senseless, snob of a jerk, Jomei was actually a good person at heart- he just had a tendency not to show it.

He liked nature around him more than anything. So he dove in, letting his cares go for a moment. He lay on his back and let the sun beat against his face. For an instant he forgot about Haruhi. And he might not have thought about her had he not heard footsteps on the sand. He opened an eye and cast his gaze toward the path. There in a blue bathing suit was Haruhi.

John""s face lifted as he took in what was around him with pure amazement. ""Karkat! Look! We""re flying!"" Karkat wrapped himself tighter on John""s leg. ""No fucking shit, now fly us out of here!"" The wind, it felt so great! It was like he was free. Yet half of John""s mind screamed that this wasn""t possible, and that humans could not fly. After that realization, his heart sank. With this information, he could only confirm that all of this was just a dream, and tomorrow morning he would wake up to Casey glubbing at him with intense bubble action. And this Karkat guy, he was also just a dream, but despite that John still felt that he had to save the both of them. Karkat tightened his grip on John""s leg. ""Hey Dumbass!

Seems sort of sci-fi, but it""s definitely a nice design. Shaking my head out of my thoughts, began my work and pried off the backing before taking the watch apart and trying to figure out what exactly had gone wrong with it to stop it ticking. Dozens of alarm clocks and coo-coo clocks went off at once and I jumped, bolting up from my seat before remembering where I was and begrudgingly getting up and wandering around to shut up the clocks. I then unlocked the front door and changed the sign to ""open"", before collapsing back on the stool behind the counter with a sigh. Despite my happy-go-lucky personality, I was not a morning person and I knew the banana from my knapsack would not wake me up enough to work on the grandfather clock. I""d worked all night to fix the pocket watch-some of the pieces seeming a little strange for a pocket watch-along with patching up the giraffe from the dumpster and cleaning it up a bit; allowing it to sit beside the cash register for now.

I turned and ran, but there was no way my mind could have remembered every path I took in this cursed maze. ""Dante!"" I screamed as the big cube struck my back. I fell, the cold floor freezing me. I tried to twist and fight, but all I could see was a sea of green, making it impossible to plan attacks. The spot of my back where the cube landed stung like someone had pressed an ice cube to it and kept it there all night. The coldness spread throughout my body like a spider web, reaching every finger and toe. I was paralyzed. ""Help,"" I gagged. Who knew slimes could paralyze you?

The beta made him want to smile; he may not be a friend, but he was certainly an ally. He felt, more than saw, Malia scowl. ""Fine."" Her claws retracted and she reluctantly stepped back, not looking at all happy about him not even having small pinpricks from her claws on his neck.

Text2: They were about to comment on how hideous the dress was, when they noticed something else- The picture was really good. Sky flicked to another picture of Shiori, dressed in her middle school uniform, in a library of some sort. She was standing on one foot, on the tips of her toes, reaching for a book just out of her reach. Sunlight poured into the room from a window, bathing Shiori in warm sunlight. As it hit her hair, it lit up the hidden brown and red highlights among the black tresses. Her face was turned towards the camera, offering a warm smile that filled her dark eyes with light. Again, it was hard comparing the photo to the real thing. And again, the picture was...really good. Despite the poor quality of the camera. Another picture, this time of Shiori in another pink dress with a little tiara on her head and what looked like a sparkly wand in her hand. She was giving the camera a familiar deadpan stare. A boy, who looked a great deal like Shiori, was dressed in a cheap dragon costume and was clinging to her with his arms wrapped around her stomach. Unlike Shiori, he was grinning happily at the camera. ""Who""s the kid?"" Kaoru asked.

A noise so loud that I can hear nothing else, not even my own thoughts fills the arena. I drop to a knee, waiting for the commotion to stop. When everything finally stops moving and the sound fades into nothing but memories of echoes I look around. The desert is still there but only in a small oval no larger than the town square back in district four. Around the oval, towering mountains have appeared. They too are covered with golden sand, and appear to be just as arid as the center of the field, but they at least offer the illusion of protection. Instantly the game changes. The fighting that has been going on around the cornucopia nearly stops entirely as tributes who knew they stood no chance in the initial bloodbath seize their chance to escape, turning tail and running for the mountains. The cannon fires a few more times, I""ve lost count though at this point. Finally when the dust settles, Emily and I walk around the cornucopia looking for which of the Careers remain.

""What,"" I kissed his forehead affectionately and took up both of his hands to play with them. Thinking of what had happened before just made me want to worship that part of his body even more, and I whirred softly with delight. The pads of his fingertips were like cute little cushions, and the webs between his phalanges were amusingly thick. I stroked his palms with what would have been my nails and he hummed with pleasure. ""That feels nice-"" The sound of King""s bathroom door opening was clear to my ear, and as evidenced by Sensei""s struggling to get out of my grip was obvious to him as well. I tried to hold him down but to no avail. Sensei was far stronger than me, after all. When King reached our line of vision we had resumed normal positions. I was tensed up, a bit annoyed at King""s presence and Sensei""s determination to not be found out. I leaned forward to land a kiss on the back of his neck but he instead turned around and, ""Wow, what a great day to stay inside and play games! Look how rainy it is outside!"" He chortled loudly into my face, and pushed me backwards in a less-than-gentle manner. ""Yeah, true."" King grunted in approval, plopping down next to Sensei. I pouted on the floor, staring up at the ceiling. Next time. Next time I would be ready. Shit. Shit. Genos was cutting it fucking close. I knew he didn""t mind being seen with me but then I really wasn""t sure how I felt about it. Focusing on the game, I ignored the dejected lump of cyborg directly behind me. It was no use. ""Aaargh!

Always thought We were alone We""ve been watched Who could have known We returned to Music Room Three, wearing our best pasted-on smiles. ""Kao-chan! Hika-chan! Where have you guys been?"" Honey ran up to us curiously, giggling. ""And where did Haru-chan go?"" Not wasting a beat, I put an arm around Hikaru. ""Haruhi just remembered that her dad was bringing a friend to her house today for dinner."" I said matter-of-factly. ""She had to get home fast."" Hikaru added. ""So she told us to let you guys know."" We finished together. ""Oh?"" Tamaki appeared out of nowhere. ""Maybe we should help-"" He was pushed aside by Kyoya. ""I don""t think that will be needed, Daddy. Let""s just finish up here, and then we can go home."" He stated, pushing up his glasses. ""I""ll deal with Haruhi tomorrow."" The shadow king smirked, and we all shuddered at the scary aura he was giving off, cruelly enunciating his words to prove his point. ""K-Kyoya..."" Tamaki blubbered, tears threatening to well up in his big violet eyes. He reached out to his best friend, pouting persuasively. I got a bad feeling that the club might go along with Milord""s plan. Hikaru felt it too. ""Uh...I don""t think that""s a good idea, Boss."" he said. ""Yeah. We should definitely leave her alone."" I confirmed. Tamaki turned to us in shock. ""Whaaat?

There was a thundersnow event happening, as heavy snowfall flew into their faces, and lightning crackled through the sky. ""Wow. It""s snowing pretty heavy out here."" Liam shared the news. ""So, where are we going?"" ""I have no idea."" Michael replied. All of a sudden the dark grey skies began to clear of clouds, as the snow began to cease. The snowflakes stopped falling, and the sun came out right in front of them as the light caused Liam and Michael to look down and cover their eyes for a while. ""Yow!"" Liam yelled. ""What just happened?"" Liam and Michael looked back up and scrutinized their surroundings. The sky was blue, and there was not a single cloud in the sky! Liam""s brain was beginning to remind him of something. ""December 16, 2012, Precipitation Worldwide Dissipates."" ""That""s it!"" Liam hollered. ""What? What""s it?"" Michael asked curious. ""The book said storms would dissipate today."" Liam replied. Suddenly a large group of very tall buildings appeared in front of them, with Michael noticing them as a smile grew on his face. ""It""s Empire City!"" Michael hollered. ""Empire WHA?"" Liam was confused again. Michael was very annoyed with Liam now. He would never get anything!

I didn""t miss that look Jesse had on his face. He was probably thinking if he could handle me for two weeks or not. It""s not like I was that much of a burden. He got on the road, and we were both quiet for the time being. I looked around at Aruba and was amazed. Everything was beautiful, and palm trees lined the clean and paved road. There were dozens of shops, and restaurants. The cool air ruffling my hair felt really good. Tanned faces were looking back at me, and music was playing everywhere. Aruba was such a happy place. Jesse finally interrupted the silence, ""This is the city Oranjestad. This is where you want to go shopping, eat at restaurants, and do whatever."" ( A/N: Yes, this is a real city. But I have no clue how to pronounce it.) I found that comment a little sexiest. Does every guy think that all girls do is just shop? Jesse doesn""t know me, and he automatically thinks I love to shop. Does he know that I like to work out and do kickboxing? Does he know that? Huh ? I didn""t think so. I strongly disliked stereotyping. It should be banned, for like, ever. ""Really, and how do you know this? Do you like to shop?"" I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm.

I couldn""t show her that I was sorrowful, that I would be alone for the rest of my life if she left. When I entered the room, her mother greeted me. She looked just as bad as Scully. Her eyes were all puffy and red; her cheeks were stained with her tears that wouldn""t stop falling. Her eyes were empty; looking as though there was nothing left in them. My heart fell to the floor and I knew the inevitable was finally here. She was leaving, for good. I took a seat next to her on the bed and placed her tiny hand in mine.

I sat on my bed, even after Ty came in and told me I was allowed out, thinking desperately that Allie would come and join me again. I waited for hours, or what seemed like hours. She never showed, I walked out of my room tiredly when I was called for dinner. When I walked out into the dinning room I saw her immediately sitting with a couple of Career boys chatting merrily. My heart sunk and my eyes immediately welled with tears, but I didn""t let them show. ""What the hell are you doing?"" I asked her when we left the elevator. ""What do you mean?"" she replied ""What do I mean, your flirting with all those other guys."" I explode ""What, am not allowed too?"" she said seductively. Now I""m literally shaking with rage. ""You said you love..."" I was cut of by her interjecting ""Actually, YOU said that YOU loved me."" she yelled then stomped off. I was about to slump to the ground and cry, but my heart when cold and frosted over, only cold hard determination crossed my eyes. ""TYREALUS!"" I boomed down the corridor and slammed into his room. ""What do you want kid?"" he replied in a slightly aggressive tone. ""Train me, now."" I said with a level tone, not dropping my gaze from his glassy eyes. ""It""s against rules go get some sleep."" he said, but as he turned to leave I grabbed him tightly on the arm.

I saw her bribe a Peacekeeper with her diamond ring, given to her by some estranged lover. The guard grunted. Well, sign for us to get tickets for the train. I saw Mags already seated inside the train. Heaving a sigh of relief, I seated myself beside her and waited for Johanna. Safe at last, from the savage Capitol, we headed towards our respective Districts. It""ll be alright, Johanna mouthed. I nodded and fell asleep. Even in my dreams, the odds were never in my favor. Getting down at the station and coming to Four was always a heart breaking task. It""s really not wise to cry in front of the people you""ve known all your life.

I wonder why guys change their personalities around other guys... When we get to the cafeteria, I see Cato sitting with the girls from the rifle team and they are all covered in paint splatters. I guess somebody wanted to train too and the thrill of paintball fueled him... Kratos must have noticed where I was staring, ""We can sit with them after we get our food if you want."" ""No, I want to sit with you. I sleep next to Cato every night, but I feel like this is the first time I get to see the real you,"" I tell him with a genuine smile.

People in District nine normally have blonde hair, but not me, not the outcast. I have shoulder length blonde hair that in nicely curled, which makes a lot of the straight haired girls feel jealous. Trying not ot be seen in a wheat field has some advantages. I duck, barely dodging a scythe. I have to be more careful next time. I streak through a few rows of wheat, and exit the field.

Dana and Melissa were arguing about how to best tell their mother about Melissa""s return to the living. Dana wanted to warn her first, Melissa wanted to just walk in. Finally they agreed to allow Dana to at least talk to her first. They arrived at the airport a little before noon, their flight home was set for 2:12 p.m. so they had a leisurely lunch, and did some shopping. Dana was paying for some Salmon that she was having shipped to her mothers house, and mused at how easily it came to her to pay for everything with one of her credit cards. They were always paid for in full when the bills came due, so she hardly ever carried any cash with her. Melissa too marveled at how much her sister had changed. Dana had grown more beautiful as she matured, and now sported a more confident, secure attitude compared to the insecure, cautious person she was before. ""Mulders influence"" she decided.

It""s not like the shifter meeting with Paul was all so bad. It was very interesting to hear about what I can and can""t do. The only bad part about it was that Paul Slater was there. But he was a good teacher. He didn""t even mention Jesse nor make a pass at me. We stayed down in the living room away from Paul""s bedroom. We talked about how shifters can materialize and dematerialize just like ghosts can. But he didn""t teach me how to do it nor did he show me does it. He said that I had all the time in the world to learn about that. Like I was going to go to his house every week for the rest of my life just to protect Jesse. Oh please, he has another thing coming.

Garlic draped over large, makeshift wooden crosses decorated the mantel above the fireplace, a horseshoe was suspended from a nail above her front door, and the carcass of a black cat sat atop her nightstand, a disturbing reminder to any felines of a certain color to stay away from her. Far, far away. She wondered why people always seemed a bit frightened of her whenever she invited them up to her apartment. Sipping her green tea idly, Kurayami""s nervous green eyes darted about her two-room home. The hairs on the back of her neck were standing up. Was something watching her? Or was it just a warning of something bad to come...? She shrieked and spilled a bit of her tea on her lap when there came a harsh knocking upon her front door. She squeaked. Who could possibly be here at this hour?! ""W-Who is it?"" She called, trying not to sound as afraid as she was feeling. The person on the other side responded almost instantly. ""Kura, it""s me. Masao."" Kurayami Kirishima blanched. ""Onii-chan? I thought you were--"" ""I was. They... let me go free. Now, let me inside, I""m freezing!"" ""H-Hai!""

Glass came smashing down, entire panes at a time. Men were stabbed through by shards. Even with all of this happening, Erza kept fighting, her weapons changing in an instant. Happy described it as Ex-quip magic. Suddenly, Erza""s armour changed too and swords floated around her in a ring. ""Dance my swords."" I looked towards Luna, who stood completely still with her head turned towards the sky. As Erza turned towards Luna for a second, I saw her eyes widen slightly. ""Lucy, you may want to go somewhere safe."" Luna said suddenly, ""I don""t want you to get hurt..."" I nodded and began heading for the nearest exit. A man ran past me. There was still a large handful of them left. ""Lucy, go after him."" Erza said. ""Eh...but..."" Erza glared at me, her face shadowed over, ""Please?"" It didn""t seem much like a please though...more like a threatening order. ""Yes ma""am."" I said quickly before I went after the fat guy. I glanced back for a second and saw Luna take in a deep breath. I also saw that Erza was tired. It must have been from driving that magic powered vehicle. Then, I continued chasing.

Gaining speed in her run, Dragon took a powerful jump and spread her fans, catching an updraft in the powerful winds before gliding towards the station. While she flew, she used her sharp eyesight to track her three companions, noting that Sarabi would only be a couple minutes behind them. Sarabi darted down the street, making sure to carry Dragon""s bag with care. There was a lot of stuff in there that was breakable, and despite their immortal friendship, Dragon would skin Sarabi alive if anything in the bag was damaged. Although it made Sarabi wonder how Dragon managed to carry the bag with her everywhere, and never have anything damaged inside it, even when they were being thrown into buildings and squashed under flying furniture. The first thing Sarabi and Dragon had done when they became heroes was memorize key locations in Paris. Some places, popular landmarks, certain streets and events were often hit by Akumatized enemies. The Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the school they attended and the park near their homes were often hit. Villains with a flair for the dramatics also liked the City Hall and the Broadcasting station.

The rain was pounding on the pavement, children were splashing around in the puddles, and people with umbrellas quickly hurried along to their dry destination. In the FBI building, all the FBI agents were busily working on their cases, except for Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. They both worked on a secret project known as the X-files. They investigated UFOs, conspiracies, and paranormal phenomenon. They usually had a lot of work to do, except for today. Mulder and Scully couldn""t seem to find any interesting cases.

""We were under the impression,"" Scully said, ""that you had walked away from consulting."" ""I""m not here in a professional capacity."" Mulder had forgotten about the heated discussion with his partner and was now focused on Frank. ""This trial is personal to you?"" ""We should all be concerned about the outcome.""

Frank had met these two agents recently at a time when he was so enmeshed in personal drama that otherwise pertinent details about Mulder and Scully had not registered with him. They had first paid him a visit when Frank was under a voluntary examination period at the Hartwell Psychiatric Hospital. Through the machinations of the Millennium Group, he had been removed as precisely as a chess piece from the FBI so that he would feel adrift. That sense of helplessness and a fear for his daughter Jordan""s safety were supposed to send Frank running back to the Group. The members wanted to exploit Frank""s ability.

She had searched the entire hospital from top to bottom but wasn""t able to find him. She started pacing Aiden""s room back and forth, biting her nails. ""Jim! I""m home!"" Melinda called. Kathy ran to the stairs, expecting the mamma""s boy to be walking behind. ""So Aiden finally decided to come home- nope. Guess not"" Jim said. ""He refused to. Nearly caused a huge scene."" ""He... did?"" Melinda nodded. ""This must really mean a lot to him"" he said. ""I guess it does."" ""I swear, Ally looks so familiar..."" ""Aiden used to date her."" ""That""s right! When was that, last year? What happened between them?"" Kathy leaned over the railing of the stairs, finally hearing something worth her time. ""Oh now that""s a complicated story. Ally broke up with him. He told me that she said that... Katie said that Kathy was jealous of her. Katie said that Kathy was so alone and was feeling like she was being replaced because of her boyfriend. So Ally broke up with Aiden. She then told Kathy that he broke up with her."" ""But in reality-"" ""They both really liked each other. Whether or not they still do, I""m not sure."" Suddenly, the mirror between Jim and Melinda practically exploded. Jim held Melinda as more glass objects around them exploded. Melinda frantically looked around and saw Kathy at the top of the stairs. ""That bitch!"" Kathy yelled. ""She was plotting this entire time! Trying to separate us!"" ""Kathy, please. Let me help-"" ""Back off!"" Kathy yelled. ""Oh, Katie messed with the wrong person!""

Text2: Sorry it""s kind of short. Originally this was going to include what I""m going to put in for the next chapter but I just felt like this should be on its own and the next part should be on its own.

Kaoru would usually arrive in time to walk her to school, but he was already late. She had waited past her limit and then decided he wasn""t going to show up. She slung her bag over her back and walked out the door. She walked to school unsure of what to feel. Betrayed by Kaoru, lonely, worried for Hikaru or just mad. When she arrived, she was very surprised to find Tamaki waiting for her. ""Senpai?"" Haruhi called. ""Hi, Haruhi"" he smiled at her. ""What are you doing here?"" ""I was kind of hoping you""d be with Kaoru. I wanted to apologize for how I acted. I was just surprised."" ""Well... that""s nice. But he""s not with me today. He never showed up. I was kind of hoping he was already at school. Guess not."" ""Oh... well he""s probably sick. Or just running late."" Haruhi nodded and just walked through the doors, knowing that all she could really do is hope. Haruhi was studying in the music room, as she often did. And that was when Kaoru finally walked in. There was no one in the music room except for the two of them. Even Kyoya had other things to do than sit and wait in the music room. Haruhi smiled at him but for once, he couldn""t find it in him to smile back. He walked up to her and she stood up to finally greet him. ""Kaoru""","{""output"": ""YES""}"

The door opened and I was heading towards the lobby. '""This is good. I need some fresh air, I think it""ll help clear my mind.'' I thought. 20 Minutes Later Hmm, this is getting better, I think I don""t have feelings for Mitch, I just probably liked his eyes. I was about to head back to the hotel until I saw three men come and surround me. '""What""s a sexy girl doing here alone?'', One of the guys said. '""Please leave me alone""', I asked kindly. '""No!'' The same guy yelled. Before I knew it, a guy from behind carried me. I yelled and screamed! '""Take off her shirt!'', The other guy said demanded. The man was about to take my shirt off, until there was someone in the distance. '""Guys, run, it might be the cops!'' The first guy whispered. In a matter of a second, the men ran away and put me down. Mitch saw me and ran towards me. '""Jessica, are you okay?!'' Mitch asked in shock. '""Yeah, I""m fine.'' I replied. His eyes were filled with worry and shock. Does he....care about me? '""I heard a scream, so I went to check it out, thank goodness I went to save you, if I didn""t you were going to get raped!'' He said still shocked. I got up and walked towards him. I don""t know what happened, but as soon as I saw his face clearly again, I instantly hugged him, and he hugged me back.

""There""s two of you and two of us, let""s be coached separately and have a evening talk together."" My voice rings out the carriage commanding. Like a leader. ""I don""t have a problem with what the boy said."" Brutus states, directing his speech at Enobaria and she smiles showing her fangs in agreement.

The events of what happened from earlier that day flood my mind as flashbacks of family crying and I having to leave my home and family awaken me from the sleepless sleep with a scream. I""m sitting up in my bed shaking as those events hit me in reality as a capitol worker comes to my side and sits on my bed to try to comfort me. She doesn""t ask or say anything but only makes me lie back down to fall asleep as she runs her fingers through my hair comfortingly. Before I know it sun is shining through the windows of the capitol train when I hear a knocking on my door as Janey informs me that its time for breakfast. I get out of bed and change into a simple outfit before heading out to the table. I take in all the different smells of the rich capitol food that sits before us on the table before scooping a bit of everything onto my plate. All of a sudden the outside world turned pitch black and Raylin states, ""This is the tunnel that we have to take to get into the Captiol."" At the thought of being really close to the Capitol excites and scares me at the same time. As the tunnel opens up a few minutes later,Dilon and I ran over to the window to look at the exquiste place they call the Capitol. The Capitol was even more amazing in person then what we see on our battered old televison set. The city glistens as all of the buildings are new looking and shiny. Much different then our houses and buildings that are falling apart back

She grinned as if this solved it all. ""For our girl,"" she pulled a slip of paper out. My heart hammered. ""Basil Canter!"" I gasped, covering my mouth with my hands. Basil? I looked around to see if any volunteers would come up. They usually did. But no one did, leaving timid Basil making her way to the stage. I sneak a glance at Obsidian, who looks shocked because of Basil""s section. Turtle takes out a lump of clay, which most kids in the career districts have, due to our income, and fiddles with it. Every who lives in our world knows how to craft. ""Now, we have another girl!"" Janie says, smiling, as if Basil might be very lucky. Lauren is a few family""s away, and she looks guilty, because she didn""t volunteer for Basil, and that""s what she trained for, and I know that she wants to volunteer for the next girl. But I also know, and see the wariness in her eyes, I see that she""s not ready; she may never be, even if we were offered another chance. But sixteen""s the last year. ""And our next tribute is,"" I hold my breath, as Janie says, ""Ivory Renolds."" Ivory Renolds. Me? Numbly I walk to the stage, where Basil is, lips pressed together, chalk white.

The figure was covered in needles and they clicked with every move they made. ""Oh, not you."" ""Good to see you too, Haley,"" the voice said. The figure changed as the pins were pulled out. Haley deactivated her Gyo as her eyes adjusted to the dim light. Haley stood up and glared at Illumi. ""Why did you have to be here?"" she groaned. ""I""m not any happier. It looks like this path requires two people,"" he said. Haley walked around him. She stopped when she saw a stone table, on top of which was an open box that contained a space for two rings. Only one of the rings was in the box. She glanced at Illumi who held up one of his hands, on which was one of the rings. She rolled her eyes, picked up her ring, and examined it. It had a gold band with a fake ruby on the top. Encasing the ruby was more gold with engravings that resembled wings. Engraved on the ruby itself was the image of a Pegasus. ""A lot of effort just for an exam,"" she commented. ""It""s quite plain if you ask me. Then again, so are you. Which is why I don""t understand why Hisoka allows you to hang around him.

There was a raw flush to his face, his dark hair unruly and windswept. While he struggled with the zip of his jacket, I returned my full attention to sketching. I knew, if I inquired, he would offer up another story about a late-night project or studying for an upcoming midterm. He didn""t even bother to put effort into his lies any longer. My chest tightened, but I ignored the sensation, furrowing my brow as I mentally ran over the proportions of my drawn horse in full stride. After a while I grew conscious of Hikaru""s continued presence; I glanced up again and caught his silhouette framed against the darkening window, a bundle of fresh clothes forgotten under one arm. His expression gave me pause: he gazed across the blackened grounds, features blank, something almost pained in the twitching of his jaw. It was so unlike my brother to seem so suddenly lost that I laid aside my pencil and leaned forward on the edge of the bed. ""Hika...?"" He jolted out of his thoughts with an irate shake of his head and grinned weakly at me. As he turned back into the light, the unknown haunted look in his eyes dissipated into familiar wryness, but I was certain nonetheless that it had been there. ""Hey, Kaoru, what""s it supposed to be like, to kiss somebody?"" I opened my mouth and closed it dumbly. Haruhi, the thought bubbled up at the back of my mind. He was thinking about Haruhi again.

""Oakkit, come forward."" The white-and-brown tom stepped up nervously. ""Until he has earned his warrior name, this apprentice will be named Oakpaw,"" Firestar announced. ""I will train him."" Oakpaw raised his head, amazed yet proud. His leader touched noses with him, and with a final nod Firestar ended the apprenticeship ceremony. A dark gray tom watched from the edge of the clearing as the cats parted to their dens. Eyes narrowed, he watched the ThunderClan leader whisk away up the Highledge.

A cute little bunny with huge, cute, glistening eyes hopped playfully by. The path leading to the bright city was made of graham cracker crumbles, and it was as smooth as silk, and no one ever fell down. The grass was sweet and tangy to the taste, thick and bouncy to the touch. The entire country-side of the city was tinted in a majestic gold. Up ahead, the city streets were paved with gold coins, the markets all giving out free, tasty treats to hungry passerby. The city looked cheerful, inviting, mystical. Mulder felt like he was going to puke. How had he ended up in this nauseating city? It was Skinner""s fault. Skinner had assigned Mulder and Scully to this case. He told them to go to this place, because an evil villain was terrorizing the citizens.

Come, everyone, let""s wait in the living room."" And so, everyone, except Haruhi and Tamaki, went to sit around the small table in the Fujioka""s apartment. Haruhi was making tea for seven while Tamaki moped on the floor. When she noticed that he was still there, she looked down and asked ""Senpai, why are you still on the ground?"" After a moment he answered ""no reason."" There was another pause before he stood up and drifted over to Haruhi""s side to watch her make tea. The short-haired girl looked at the blond. ""Uh, you know, you don""t have to wait for me, Tamaki-senpai. I""ll be finished soon."" ""...Ok."" Then, he trudged into the living room and sat quietly between Hikaru and Kyoya, his knees drawn up to his chest as he drew circles on the floor with his index finger. Not long after, Haruhi brought in a tray filled with teacups and sat down next to Blaise. ""This place is more cramped than usual,"" Hikaru commented. For this, he received harsh shushing from both his brother and the host club king. His eyes widened as he covered his mouth when he realized how tactless he had been toward commoner housing. Blaise drained the rest of her tea and stood up. ""I really should get going."" Everyone""s heads turned to look at her. ""Why, Blaise? Is something the matter?"" Ranka asked. ""Oh no.

""Our train back to District 13 leaves in half an hour, we should get changed and head out."" He says, dismissing Effie, and pulling me forward towards our room. As we enter the room, I sigh as I feel any slight happiness I felt exit my body. I walk over to the bed, flopping down on it burying my face into a pillow. I flinch as I feel a hand on my lower back, and I turn over and look at Peeta, a small sad smile on his face. ""It will take time."" He whispers. ""It feels like all the time I have left on this earth will never be enough. This pain will never go away."" ""I never said it would go away, I said it will dull.

I deflected it with my armor and the fireball hit him in the face. He was hurled backwards and disappeared through a wall that he passed through. Then, a hand grabbed my leg and pulled me through the floor. I appeared in a place that looked like... space! There were stars spinning around me. Three Enderfiends circled Herogrime. They all put their hands on his shoulders and they all were masked in a purple light. I looked back and saw that Herogrime had turned the same black color of the Enderfiends and had dark purple eyes. He now carried a sword that was just as dark purple as his eyes were. He pointed the sword at me and grunted. If Dimentio said I was to be a hero, I don""t know if he meant almost peeing my pants. I decided to be brave and I sprinted towards him. I slashed but he wasn""t there anymore. Dang, bro you learned to teleport like a fiend. I felt a sharp blade pierce my arm from behind me. AH!

That as well as Paul""s actual laugh sent a chill down my spine. I mean, it would be very...weird, if he could, you know, read my mind. That-I was convinced-could never happen. Turns out I was wrong. ""I can, you know,"" Paul murmured, caressing my cheek gently. Paul-in addition to being a wanna-be murderer- is entirely cold-blooded. ""You can what?"" I asked. My voice came out as a croak.

The door burst open and all three teens turned to see Freddy giving all three of them a glare, especially to Foxy. ""And just what the hell is going on!?""

He sighed, backing away to the room adjacent to it, smiling when he saw a red bed, with thick velvet drapes surrounding it. Moonlight pooled into the room from the window beside the large bed, and Grell couldn""t help but notice that the room was rather...Dusty, as was the whole house. The lady obviously had fired all her staff, but wasn""t very keen to housework. Grell carefully laid the woman on the bed, looking down at her with curious eyes. Her hair pooled around her, and her breathing was slow, as she had slipped back into a deep sleep once again. He wondered if he should just leave her there, like that, but it wouldn""t be good for her cold.

He went to work on the laces of her dark red boots, admiring them as he slipped it off her small foot, then went to work on it""s twin. He placed the boots on the floor, and then pursed his lips. Grell had never been to bed with a woman before. He had kissed a young girl when he was still in school, and had gone so far as to allow her to touch him intimately.

They were completely covered by a navy-blue hooded cloak. The only sign of them being human was a hand protruding from it, holding a lit torch. It was impossible to see their face under the hood, despite the torch being held right in front of them. Slow and carefully, they approached me as I attempted to scoot away. As soon as they were close, they made a quick, sudden movement, so I shut my eyes and flinched, expecting a fatal blow. It never came, and I slowly opened my eyes to see what had happened. The figure was simply crouching in front of me, watching. Even when they were this close, it was inconceivably dark under their hood. A few moments of pure silence later, they spoke.

Yes, it was a clever orchestration, and a striking resemblance, anyone could have fallen for it, but a hoax nonetheless. It appeared that Chris Carter himself, the Almighty Master of Morbidity & Hoaxes, fell more or less, into his own trap.

Following a great storm in Vancouver, Carter""s computer was struck again by lightning, but there was more to it. 3 months ago, scared by the electric activities going on in his own working room, Chris Carter planted a couple of lightning rods around to attract lightning. The odd thing is they did, but his computer wasn""t spared, as if something more, an energy above that of the lightning rods, was in there. So, Carter""s room became a very dangerous place, and in the light of future events, sort of a gateway to another dimension.

All the same I still needed a place to be alone and perhaps dry off and change, so I headed upstairs via the back chamber and stairwell, keeping out of sight of everyone until I had made my way to one of the music rooms. Music room one, I knew this one was fairly out of use as it was used mainly to store instruments, perfect for someone like me. The door was locked, however so I drew out one of my pins and wiggled it around in the lock a little, working it carefully before I managed to spring the lock open and I stepped inside. The grand pianos were covered in large white sheets and the shutters were closed over the windows, making the room dark and dreary so I went over and pulled them open before lifting the window up, allowing the light to filter inside as well as a soft breeze which I inhaled softly, feeling better already as I stood surrounded by many different instruments. Putting down my bag I drew out my towel and began to dry myself, undressing from my uniform and pulled out the spare set of clothes I carried to change. My clothes consisted of a simple modest dress of black with came down to just above my ankles with a slight frill and a white ruffled collar that buttoned up at my throat with a neat bow.

It was not the light that had awakened him; by his internal clock it was time, and so he rose. As silent as a breath of wind, he then slipped out of the room. Padding lightly down the steps, he turned and followed a darkened corridor. The lack of light didn""t seem to affect him, either; without need for a guiding handhold, he strode onward confidently. His eyes glittered cat-like in the gloom, milky-white like twin moons. Finally he reached his destination: the front door. Expert hands flitted over the lock, then he paused to listen for any noise in the household. Once outside, he exhaled the breath he had been holding, a puff of fog hovering by his face. He stood a moment facing the house, as though gathering himself, one hand on the door handle, the other clenching a navy bandana. Slowly, he released his vice grip on the handle, reaching up to set the band on his forehead. He tucked the ends under a mane of long hair, swiftly tying them. Once satisfied with the secure tightness of the bandana round his head, he turned and blinked in the flood of warm sunlight. It caressed his tired features and danced in his pale eyes.

The snow was in perfect condition to make a snow man. Easy to shape, and strong enough to hold whatever form one molded it into. Tossing it to the ground, he slowly dropped to his knees, and started rolling it around to collect more snow, to increase the size of the ball. Steadily, it grew to the desired size.

He decided that logically the best place to find sticks would be near the small patch of trees nearby. Digging around in the snow beneath them, he found two twigs of equal proportion with ease, and started back to the incomplete snowman. Staring up at it, wondering how Hinamori found this to be entertaining, he jammed the two sticks into the torso, one on each side of the snowman.

""I""m sorry,"" he whimpers, his face hangs heavy with guilt and is drowned out of color. His lips are still dry and for a moment he reminds me of a dying fish: hopeless and ashamed. I stand up and inch slowly closer to him, ""It""s alright."" Still all he can manage to do is stand frozen, like Hana, and say, ""I""m so sorry, Evelyn."" Without taking him out of his trance, I entangle his hands into mine and guide him to the loveseat.

Rockwell raced after him, and watched as he flipped a switch to open the hatch and walk out. ""You might want to hurry up and get to your work, and I shall get back to mine."" He said, pointing to the door. ""Thanks."" Rockwell said, walking out. Nicholas shut the door behind him, walking back to his laboratory. Rockwell breathed a sigh of relief with his discovery that Nicholas hadn""t been kidnapped in the middle of the night. He walked down the street, bumping into a woman who was standing outside of the building next door. ""Sorry!"" He said, offering her a hand up. The girl took it, and gave him an inquisitive look. ""I haven""t seen you around before."" She said, crossing her arms. ""We just moved in, next door."" ""That""s interesting. What""s your name?"" ""Rockwell."" ""Lucille."" ""That""s a neat name.""

Care for a wager?"" ""No gambling, thanks."" ""Ok then, when do we go? ""Now!"" She said, taking off down the street, with Rockwell chasing after her. She was fast, but was brought to a halt by a herder and his cows. Rockwell leapt over the cows and continued running while Lucille tried to make her way around the smelly stream of cute cows.

Stiles nodded. Derek once again kissed the temple of Stiles"" head and commenced a staunch walk out of the house. Stiles watched from the window, making sure that Derek disappeared from plain sight before he made his way towards the door. At first, Stiles just opened the aperture, and let the sunlight leak through the trees onto the deck in front of his. He peered through the branches, in search of finding the source of the light. But it all just seemed to be one blur. Hi eyes were still trying to readjust to the brightness after being inside for such a long time. He stepped forward. The line in which had been created as a shield around the house was visible now, the sun enlivening the rich black powder like glitter. He contemplated for a moment. Should I? Shouldn""t I? And after a small debate with himself, he stood over the line. Stiles instantly knew what he was doing was wrong, but he couldn""t help it. The man Stiles had shared himself with was now putting his life on the line for him, and this made Stiles uneasy. Plus, Stiles liked being told off by Derek. He kind of had the fantasy of sharing make-up sex with Derek. The inner conflict Stiles was having with himself made him zone out for a moment.

It yelled in frustration, focusing completely on the torture the Mage was recently experiencing by closing its violet pupils. But the cyan eyed man felt something was wrong as well.

She seemed to be no older than Henry, Rika, and Takato, yet there was a solemnity about her that usually only came with age. While Katrina""s hair fell below her shoulders, this girl""s hair fell to the small of her black and was the color of the night sky without any lights. She wore a fluent white dress that fell just above her knees and was no sleeved. Without a word, the girl began to walk out of the clearing. ""Hey, wait a minute!"" Henry called to her. The girl continued to walk but looked at the them over her own shoulder. They were frozen stiff by the expression in her eyes. Her midnight blue eyes were lifeless and unremorseful, distant, and yet at the same time deep inside there seemed to be something burning like fire, an anger that was not brought to the surface of her demeanor. Before any of them could utter another word the girl had disappeared into the darkness of the night. ""Well that was a complete waste of time."" Rika said crossly. ""But still...""

Another had a student that was almost identical to Fred or George: same flaming red hair, same freckles, same robes, he just seemed to be younger. ""Hi, Ron. Hi, Harry."" George said to the redhead and to a boy that had midnight black hair that was rather messy and emerald green eyes behind round glasses. What attracted her most, though, was a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Harry was sitting next to a girl with bushy brown hair. ""No time to talk."" George was right; they were headed for another table, and it seemed they would have to crash!

Hikaru chuckled and shifted up on his elbows. ""So, if I can get that reaction out of you, no problems with Haruhi then."" Just like that... I felt the flush drain away from my face and stared at the far wall, a wave of cold rushing through my veins. Obliviously Hikaru rolled off me toward the edge of the bed and ended up, catlike, back on his feet.

I managed to get the key into the slot without dropping it. I twisted it, grabbing for the door knob next and turning it gingerly before kicking the door lightly with my foot. The room was dark, and from what I could barely make out, thick curtains were drawn, blocking any of the midday sunlight from filtering into the room.

After a few moments, he pulled back and winked at me. ""Was it as good for you as it was for me?"" he asked with a smirk. ""I don""t know, the only thing that came to mind was the word ""cootieboogers"","" I replied calmly. Mackels discreetly lowered his binoculars so he could watch Scully""s reaction to the public display of affection.

Noah was helping Rob orient himself and aim at the first hole. Mulder walked over to them to watch while I finished zipping up my bag. Just as Rob started to swing his driver, Noah made an odd noise, causing Rob""s shot to veer off towards a nearby tree. The next thing I knew, Mulder was lying flat on his back with a stunned

Text2: Rob clasped his brother on the shoulder, and then placed a hand on Scully""s arm, whispering: ""Can we talk somewhere quiet?"" He led her through the bright, hot, dense rooms, and soundlessly up the front staircase. On the second floor, the noise below became hum of pained voices, and faded even more as Rob ushered her into a small bedroom, closing the door behind him with a faint click. The moon beamed through the gauzy curtains on the windows, and lit a silver trail on the wooden crib by the far wall. Rob crossed to it, and gripped the rail until his knuckles were white. Scully came up beside him, and stared down at the sleeping form within. The baby was asleep on her back, her arms flung out and her thin blond hair still barely covering her head, and Scully recognized her as Rob and Jenna""s five month-old daughter, Sarah. ""Do you know what her middle name is?"" Rob murmured. ""It""s Katherine. I chose it, and Jenna has no idea why. It""s better that way, I""m sure, but I thought you might like to know."" Scully felt something thick in her throat, and managed: ""Rob, I..."" He interrupted swiftly. ""Why Thomas, Dana? I know you know why, but I thought it might not be an explanation you wanted to give in front of the whole family."" ""Yes, I do know why, Rob,"" she answered slowly. ""At the very least, we are reasonably certain we know why."" ""Tell me, then."" She bit her lower lip for a moment, and then tried her best to compress their theories into a single explanation.

""Who else would we have to pick on around here?"" Mike smiled halfheartedly. ""I""ll miss you guys."" ""We""ll miss you too, little brother,"" James said, and ruffled his hair before pulling him into a hug. ""But we""ll only miss you for a little while. Stay alive in there, and come home."" Mike pulled out of his brother""s embrace without a word, and James stepped back, as Marc stepped forward to hug his little brother as well. ""See you soon, kid. Good luck."" He stepped back just as the Peacekeeper opened the door to tell them time was up. Each of the older boys looked back once to smile sadly at their brother before walking out the door. Mike backed up against the wall as reality began to set in. Being a Tribute in the Hunger Games for all but one person each year was as good as a death sentence. And he knew that every other Tribute out there had brothers, or parents, or sisters, or friends... someone who was telling them the exact same thing Mike""s brother""s had. That they were strong enough to pull through and that they could come home. It would only be true for one person. He looked up as his door opened again, and his parents walked through. His mother""s eyes were red and puffy, and her cheeks tear-stained. His father""s jaw was clenched, and

Instead of calling for him, she got out of bed and decided to take a shower. As she waited for the water to heat up, the blaze began to lose herself in thought. Am I ready for this? Will I even be a good mother? What if I mess up? She mentally slapped herself for thinking these things. It""s just nerves, I""m nervous, that""s all. Normal... Her thoughts wouldn""t leave her the entire time she was in there. After finishing the relaxing shower, she opted to wear something more comfortable then her normal attire.

His facial features also changed- he went paler as his face became gaunt, hauntingly creepy. His boyish grin twisted into a sneer that made her stomach drop. He pulled away from their sweet embrace, a smaller pair of hands grabbed her roughly by the tops of her arms. ""-there was someone out there-"" his beautiful, golden-blond hair shortened and turned a fiery, hellish red. And instead of staring into Kristoff""s amazing brown eyes, she was pinned down by forest green eyes filled with a burning hatred and jealousy. ""No..."" ""-who loved you..."" Darkness. Anna woke with a start. She blearily looked out her window to see the sun peeking from behind the mountains in the distance. She let out a wide, shaky yawn as her breathing slowed. The ""Great Thaw"", as it had been dubbed, had been just a week ago, and that was the fourth time she""d had that same nightmare since the incident. Things had been such a whirlwind lately that sleep had been evading her. ""At least I was able to get through the night this time,"" she muttered, stretching her arms over her head, then dropping them. She felt something clutched in her hand.

With his parents Morinozuka Takashi and Suzu, they planned to have a nice quiet evening as they welcomed the New Year.

""What other languages do you know?"" Lara, still in German, asked excitedly. And just like that was how the two seemingly temporary friends passed the remaining 2 hours of their flight, not feeling the tiniest bit doozy. The stench of smoke and liquor stuck to their clothes but neither seemed to care, both calmly sitting back against the soft velvet, they talked about the languages they knew, the things they liked, even goofily practicing their English with eachother where Lara seemed to be a tiny bit more proficient in. Neither asked for the reason of their travels nor about their lives before the flight. It was here, one of the rarest moments of his life, that Erik forgot about Schmidt, Auschwitz, his anger and hate, even about his own family that had passed. All he thought about was the here and now, how this woman he met a mere four hours ago captivated him in such a profound, curious manner that he couldn""t quite place. How their silly banter appealed to him in some way. The flight eventually had to end, landing quite roughly, at Erik""s expense and Lara""s amusement. They both left the cabin hand-in-hand as they passed by the stewardess that Erik seemed to unfairly dislike and finally snickered when they got closer to the airport.

She was nodding with a faint smile on her lips. She softly clapped as I wound to a close. ""My, my Suze"" She said her smile lighting up her lined face. ""You have made me proud"" I smiled and looked down, not wanting to look arrogant. I knew I was good at playing the piano. Its about the only thing I am good at. Mrs Scarlet, my piano teacher and all round grandparent-like person was the only one that I truly felt comfortable about. Even now, as she was raining down compliments on me I smiled at her without feeling the slightest bit self-conscious. She finally talked her way down and dismissed herself. When left on my own I sat awhile before going to go seek my father. The piano was situated in its own room off the dining area. The music room was perfectly sculptured complete with swirling designs that were obviously of another era. My father and I lived in this mansion, he was a head of top law firm and me a senior in high school. I knew the music room like the back of my own hand, I used to come here all the time after my mother died. I was 9 and I had only cried a handful of times. I chose to vent my frustration and sadness out in the form of musical notes and I strived. My father was worried about me

The cool breezes that shifted the clouds and shook the leaves on the trees churned the air, keeping the temperature comfortable enough to be outside. Even without a watch, Nya could tell by the way the sun rested in the sky above her that it was only a few hours into the evening. Perhaps four thirty or five o""clock, but certainly not any later. The guys would be back any time now, hopefully with the second Fang Blade.

Zane had kept in touch with her through the falcon, having the mechanical bird bring her a crumpled note saying that they would be staying longer than expected in an attempt to enter the contest in order to get closer to the Fang Blade before making the grab.

Mike, Bubbles, and Robin crowded along with the other kids, pushing a few sixth graders out of the way as they stampeded out of the double doors and into the hallway. Bubbles lost her grip on Robin and lost sight of Mike momentarily before she rejoined them at a less crowded area in the hallway.

He smiles as he hands it to me and says, '""Looks like you might need a little more room for your ideas."" ""Thank you!"" I give him a huge hug, knowing that it must have cost him at least a squirrel. These were quite rare. ""Just never lose your clever, active mind"" he said smiling. There is was again. that word. Clever. He always seemed to call me that. Rest assured I would make it a priority to make sure that my mind never changed. As long as I focused on my goal it would stay the same. Although I hadn""t made progress I was going to. Whatever the capital was up to, they couldn""t keep it a secret forever. Clever

Text2: ""So you want me to be replaced by a fucking house!"" I screamed angrily. My parents allowed me to go on, after all, if I was being banished, at least let me revolt back. ""Child, you are not being..."" ""HOW OLD ARE YOU THAT YOU FUCKING FORGET THAT YOU SAID THAT THE HOUSE IS USED TO REPLACE ME!"" I screamed, breathing the heavy smug air in the room. They looked at me, shocked at what I said. ""Child, you must leave this place, before nightfall, and your family things have been teleported to their new home. Archer leave at once from my presence and Amy and Cole you must stay in the building we provide you and stay at The End at all time."" ""So now your keeping my parents under lockdown."" I called. The Elder looked at me his eyes full of anger. He opened his mouth and breathed in a gust of air and spewed out purple flames toward my direction. I jumped back, watching as the floor I was just standing on was set on fire, the flames flickering a purple aura. ""Leave now, don""t let me see you ever again, Amy and Cole."" my parents looked up towards him. ""I""ll give you a few minutes to talk to your son before he leaves."" they looked at him shocked, but happy, seeing how they could at least talk to their child for a few moments before he leaves. I walked out the room, mom and dad followed me from behind, their face full of sadness. ""Archer, I don""t understand..."" my mom said, tears coming out of her eyes. ""Mom, it""s alright. I can survive out there."" ""Not with your abilities you won""t. That""s the fucking Badlands out there, it""s not a place to go in."" My dad","{""output"": ""NO""}"
1099,"Text1: ""Oh, sorry miss, I just saw your door open and was worried. You gotta be careful in a place like this."" He said innocently, a little too innocently. But I was too freaked out to notice. His voice was an odd combination. It was low, but it had a nasally rasp to it. ""Oh, well thank you. I was just picking my schedule up from work, and didn""t think I would take so long."" Stop talking! I admonish myself, there""s another thing you have to be careful about. Conversing with strangers. Back home, people say hi when you pass by. Here, people avoid eye contact like a disease. You just never know who""s the wrong person to mess with. ""You have a good night, miss."" He said before walking away. I let out the breath I wasn""t aware I was holding and looked through my car before getting in, not for stolen items, but for harmful items. ""That was weird."" I murmured to myself. I have a very bad habit of talking to myself. I check my phone before heading out, and see that I missed a text from Cassidy. We""re going to dinner, meet us at Gotham City Nights. - Cassy I put my phone in the handle well of my door, and started out toward home. I still lived with Cassidy and her parents, they welcomed me as their third child- including Cassy""s brother Dominic- and I figured it would be cheaper than getting an apartment. I went back to the house, showered, and put on a black mini dress and zebra print flats, foregoing make up for the night. I threw on my heavy coat, gloves, and scarf and made my way out into the heart of the city. ""Well, boys, I think it""s high time we

Text2: ""Oh, that is so Doug!"" As if she""s known him for more than eight hours. She was still laughing when Stu suddenly spit his iced tea on Jade and the baby and she went to clean him up. ""What the hell?"" I asked. ""What the fuck, man, you""ve gotta get yourself together."" Phil said. ""Holy shit."" ""Hey man, she""s hot."" I said. ""Yeah, be proud of yourself."" Phil agreed with me. ""She is wearing my grandmother""s ring!"" He almost yelled. ""Yeah, you know my grandmother""s holocaust ring, the ring I was going to give to Melissa?"" ""Well, she""s better than Melissa and I don""t even remember hanging out with her."" I got up and asked where the bathroom was. I was dying to see what my wound looked like. I found it easily in the small apartment, and took down the sleeve of my shirt and the strap of my bra. I looked like someone whipped my shoulder. And it burned a bit. I sighed heavily and wondered how I was going to cover this up for the wedding. Oh shit! The wedding! We need to find Doug. I ran back out into the living room. ""I have a question, when you said your shift ended, does that mean you""re a nurse? Or a...Blackjack dealer?"" Stu asked. ""You know this, I""m a stripper! Well, technically I""m an escort but, stripping""s a great way to meet the clients."" Everyone just nodded and I took my place beside Phil. ""Smart."" Phil said. I looked at him weirdly. ""Savvy."" Stu agreed. ""But that""s all in the past, now that I married a doctor."" She said, looking to Stu. ""I""m just a dentist."" He humbled himself. ""Las Vegas police! Freeze!"" I heard someone yell before the door was kicked open. Phil pushed my head","{""output"": ""YES""}"
